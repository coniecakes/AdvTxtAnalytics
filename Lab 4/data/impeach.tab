HEARING	SPEAKER	MAIN SPEAKER	ROLE	TEXT
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	your interest in being here. In turn, we ask for your respect as we proceed with today’s hearing. It is the intention of the committee to proceed without disruptions. As Chairman, I’ll make all necessary and appropriate steps to maintain order and to ensure the committee is run in accordance with house rules, and House Resolution 660. With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	This morning we will hear from Gordon Sondland, the American Ambassador to the European Union. We are here today as part of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, because president Donald Trump sought to condition military aid to Ukraine in an Oval Office meeting with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in exchange for politically motivated investigations that Trump believed would help his reelection campaign.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The first investigation was of a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for interfering in the 2016 election. Second investigation that Trump demanded was into a political rival that he apparently feared most, Joe Biden. Trump sought to weaken Biden, and to refute the fact that his own election campaign in 2016 had been helped by Russian hacking and dumping operation, and Russian social media campaign directed by Vladimir Putin to help Trump.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Trump’s scheme undermined military and diplomatic support for a key ally, and undercut US anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. Trump put his personal and political interests above those of the United States. As ambassador Sondland would later tell career foreign service officer David Holmes, immediately after speaking to the President, “Trump did not give a expletive about Ukraine. He cares about big stuff that benefits him, like the Biden investigations that Rudy Giuliani was pushing.”
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador Sondland was a skilled deal maker, but in trying to satisfy a directive from the President found himself increasingly embroiled in an effort to press the new Ukrainian president, that deviated sharply from the norm in both terms of policy and process. In February, Ambassador Sondland traveled to Ukraine on his first official trip to that country. While in Kiev, he met with then US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and found her to be an excellent diplomat with a deep command of Ukrainian internal dynamics.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On April 21st, Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine and spoke to President Trump who congratulated him, and said he would look into attending Zelensky’s inauguration, but pledged to send someone at a very, very high level. Between the time of that call and the inaugural and May 20, Trump’s attitude towards Ukraine hardened.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"On May 13th, the President ordered Vice President Mike Pence, not to attend Zelensky’s inauguration, opting instead to dispatch the self dubbed Three Amigos; Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Ambassador Sondland, and Ambassador Kurt Volker, the special representative for Ukraine negotiations."
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	After returning from the inauguration, members of the US delegation briefed President Trump on their encouraging first interactions with the new current Ukrainian administration. They urged the President to meet was Zelensky, but the President’s reaction was decidedly hostile. The President’s order was clear, however. Talk with Rudy.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	During this meeting, ambassador Sondland first became aware of what Giuliani and the President were really interested in. “This whole thing was sort of a continuum,” he testified at his deposition, “… starting at the May 23rd meeting. Ending up at the end of the line when the transcript of the call came out.” “It was a continuum,” he would explain, “… that became more insidious over time.”
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The Three Amigos were disappointed with Trump’s directive to engage Giuliani, but vowed to press ahead. Ambassador Sondland, “We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky,” which the group teamed crucial for US/Ukrainian relations, “… or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President’s concerns. We chose the latter path.”
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In the coming weeks, Ambassador Sondland got more clearly involved in Ukraine policymaking. Starting with the June 4 US mission to the EU Independence Day event in Brussels, one month early. Secretary Perry, Ulrich Brechbuhl and the State Department Counselor, and Sondland met with President Zelensky, whom Sondland had invited personally on the margins of the event.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On June 10, 2019, Secretary Perry organized a conference call with Sondland, then National Security Advisor, John Bolton, Volker and others. They reviewed Ukraine strategy with Bolton and decided that Perry, Sondland and Volker would assist Ambassador Bill Taylor, the new acting ambassador in Kiev on Ukraine, and discuss Trump’s desire for Rudy Giuliani to be somehow involved. At the end of the call, according to Sondland, we all felt very comfortable with the strategy moving forward.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Two weeks later, on June 27th, Ambassador Sondland called Taylor to say that, “Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that he was not standing in the way of investigations.” On July 10th, Ambassador Sondland and other US officials met at the White House with a group of US and Ukrainian officials. Participants in the meeting have told us that Ambassador Sondland invoked acting White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and said that the White House meeting sought by the Ukrainian President with Trump would happen only if Ukraine undertook certain investigations. National Security Advisor, Bolton, abruptly ended the meeting upon hearing this.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Undeterred, Sondland brought Ukrainian delegation downstairs to another part of the White House and was more explicit. According to witnesses, Ukraine needed to investigate the Bidens or Burisma in the 2016 election interference if they wanted to get a meeting at all.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Following this meeting in July, Bolton said that he would not be part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this. Sondland continued to press for a meeting, but he and others were willing to settle for a phone call as an intermediate step.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On July 21, Taylor texted Sondland that, “President Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument of Washington domestic reelection politics.” Sondland responded, “Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built irrespective of the pretext, so that Zelensky and Trump could meet and all of this will be fixed.”
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On July 25th, the day of the Trump/Zelensky call, Volker had lunch in Kiev with a senior aid to Ukrainian President Zelensky, and later texted the aide to say that he’d heard from the White House, “Assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck.”
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador Sondland spoke to President Trump a few minutes before the call was placed, but was not on the call. During that now infamous phone call with Zelensky, Trump responded to the Ukrainian expression of appreciation for US defense support, and requests to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles by saying, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.” Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the discredited 2016 conspiracy theory, and even more ominously, look into the Bidens.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Neither had been part of the official preparatory material for the call, but they were in Donald Trump’s personal interest, and the interests of his reelection campaign. The Ukrainian President knew about both in advance. In part because of Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Sondland’s efforts to make him aware of what the President was demanding.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Around this time, Ambassador Sondland became aware of the suspension of security assistance to Ukraine, which had been announced on a secure inter-agency video conference on July 18th. Telling us that it was extremely odd that nobody involved in making and implementing policy towards Ukraine knew why the aid had been put on hold. During August, Sondland participated in conference calls, and text messages with Volker and Juliani and said that the gist of every call was what was going to go in the press statement.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In August, nine text message with Volker/Sondland stated, “I think POTUS really wants the deliverable,” which was according to Sondland a deliverable public statement that President Trump wanted to see or hear before a White House meeting could happen.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On September 1, Ambassador Sondland participated in Vice President Pence’s bilateral meeting was Zelensky in Warsaw, during which Zelensky raised the suspended security assistance. Following that meeting, Sondland approached the senior Ukrainian official to tell him that he believed what could help them move the aid was if the Ukrainian Prosecutor General would go to the mic and announced that he was opening the Burisma investigation.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Sondland told Taylor that he had made a mistake by telling Ukrainians that an Oval Office Meeting was dependent on a public announcement of investigations. In fact, everything was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Even the announcement by the Prosecutor General would not satisfy the President. On September 7, Sondland spoke to the President and told Tim Morrison and Bill Taylor about the call shortly thereafter. The President said that although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public we would be at a stalemate. Moreover, an announcement by the Prosecutor General would not be enough. President Zelensky must announce personally that he would open the investigations.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Sondland Taylor that, “President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something,” he said,”… the businessmen asks that person to pay up before signing the check.” The check referred to here was the US military assistance to Ukraine, and Ukraine had to pay up with investigations. Throughout early September, Volker and Sondland sought to close the deal on an agreement that Zelensky would announce investigations. After, Taylor texted Sondland on September 9, 2019 that, “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.”
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"16 days later, the transcript of the July 25th call was made public, and the American people learn the truth of how our President tried to take advantage of a vulnerable ally. Now it is up to Congress, as the People’s representatives, to determine what response is appropriate. If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections. If he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign, and did so by withholding official act; a White House meeting, or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid, it will be up to us to decide whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency."
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Finally, I want to say a word about the President and Secretary Pompeo’s obstruction of this investigation. We have not received a single document from the State Department. As Ambassador Sondland’s opening statement today will make clear, those documents bear directly on this investigation and this impeachment inquiry. I think we know now, based on a sample of the documents attached to Ambassador Sondland’s statement, that the knowledge of this scheme was far and wide, and included among others Secretary of State Pompeo, as well as the Vice President.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We can see why Secretary Pompeo, and President Trump have made such a concerted, and across-the-board effort to obstruct this investigation and this impeachment inquiry. I will just say this. They do so at their own peril. I remind the President that Article Three of the Impeachment Articles drafted against President Nixon was his refusal to obey the subpoenas of Congress. With that, I recognize ranking member Nunes for any remarks that he would wish to make.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentleman. We are joined this afternoon by Ambassador Gordon Sondland. I’m sorry, this morning. It was a long day yesterday. Gordon Sondland is the US Representative to the European Union with the rank of Ambassador. Before joining the State Department, Ambassador Sondland was the founder and CEO of Providence Hotels, a national owner and operator of full service hotels. Also prior to his government service, Ambassador Sondland was engaged in charitable enterprises.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Two final points before witness is sworn. First, witness depositions as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature, and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information that may touch on classified information will be addressed separately. Second, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat of reprisal, or attempt to retaliate against any US government official for testifying before Congress, including you or any of your colleagues. If you would please rise and raise your right hand, I will begin by swearing you in.  Questioning
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We will now proceed the first round of questions as detailed in the memo provided to committee members. There’ll be 45 minutes of questions conducted by the chairman and majority counsel followed by 45 minutes for the ranking member or minority counsel. Following that, unless I specify additional equal time for extended questioning, we will proceed under the five minute rule and every member will have the chance to ask questions. I recognize myself or majority counsel for the first round of questions. Ambassador Sondland, there’s a lot of new material in your opening statement for us to get through, but I want to start with a few top line questions before passing it over to Mr. Goldman. In your deposition, you testified that you found yourself on a continuum that became more insidious over time. Can you describe what you mean by this continuum of insidiousness?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And then of course, on July 25th, although you were not privy to the call and other condition was added, that being the investigation of the Bidens.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You saw that in the call record, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But when you did receive-
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So on this continuum, the beginning of the continuum begins on May 23rd when the President instructs you to talk to Rudy?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you understood that as a direction by the President that you needed to satisfy the concerns that Rudy Giuliani would express to you about what the President wanted in Ukraine?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now in your opening statement, you confirm that there was a quid pro quo between the White House meeting and the investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election that Giuliani was publicly promoting, is that right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And in fact, you say that other senior officials in the State Department and the chief of staff’s office, including Mick Mulvaney, Secretary Pompeo, were aware of this quid pro quo, that in order to get the White House Meeting that we’re going to have to be these investigations the President wanted.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And those again, are investigations into 2016 and Burisma slash the Bidens?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But you would ultimately learn that Burisma meant the Bidens when you saw the call record, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And then on July 26th you confirm you did indeed have the conversation with president Trump from a restaurant in Kiev that David Holmes testified about last week, is that right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you have no reason to doubt Mr. Holmes recounting of your conversation with the President?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You have no reason to believe that Mr. Holmes would make that up if that’s what he recalls you saying? You have no reason to question that, do you?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But the rest of Mr. Holmes recollection is consistent with your own?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Are you familiar with his testimony?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And the only exception you take as to the mention of the name Biden?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I think you said in your testimony this morning that not only is it correct that the President brought up with you investigations on the phone the day after the July 25th call, but you would have been surprised had he not brought that up, is that right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Holmes also testified that you told him, “President Trump doesn’t care about Ukraine. He only cares about big stuff that relates to him personally.” I take it from your comment you don’t dispute that part of the conversation.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So you don’t dispute that part of Mr. Holmes’ recollection?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In August when you worked with Rudy Giuliani and a top Ukrainian aid to draft a public statement for President Zelensky to issue that includes the announcement investigations into Burisma. You understood that was required by President Trump before he would grant the White House meeting to President Zelensky?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And the Ukrainians understood that as well?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you informed Secretary Pompeo about that statement as well?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Later in August, you told Secretary Pompeo that President Zelensky would be prepared to tell President Trump that his new justice officials would be able to announce matters of interest to the President, which could break the log jam. When you say matters of interest to the President, you mean the investigations that President Trump wanted, is that right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And that involved 2016 and Burisma or the Bidens?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And when you’re talking here about breaking the logjam, you’re talking about the logjam over the security assistance, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But that included the security assistance, did it not?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And based on the context of that email, this was not the first time you had discussed his investigations with Secretary Pompeo was it?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	He was aware of the connections that you were making between the investigations and the White House meeting and security assistance?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Did he ever take issue with you and say, “No, that connection is not there or you’re wrong?”
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now you mentioned that you also had a conversation with Vice President Pence before his meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw and that you raised the concern you had as well, that the security assistance was being withheld because of the President’s desire to get a commitment from Zelensky to pursue these political investigations. What did you say to the Vice President?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you understood that the Ukrainians were going to raise the security assistance with the Vice President at this meeting?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, it was public by that point that there was a hold on the security assistance, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, you knew certainly they were concerned about the hold on the security assistance, right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you wanted to help prepare the Vice President for the meeting by letting him know what you thought was responsible for the hold on the security assistance.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Do you recall anything else the Vice President said other than nodding his head when you made him aware of this fact?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And it was immediately after this meeting between the Vice President and Zelensky that you went to speak with Yermak and you told him similarly that in order to release the military assistance they were going to have to publicly announce these investigations?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, in that short conversation, as you would later relay to Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor, you informed Mr. Yermak that they would need to announce these investigations in order to get the aid, did you not?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you confirmed for him that he needed to get it done if they were going to get the military aid.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor have also relayed a conversation you had with the President following the Warsaw meeting, in which the President relayed to you that there was no quid pro quo but nevertheless, unless Zelensky went to the mic and announced these investigations, they would be a stalemate over the aide, is that correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And that was an accurate reflection of your discussion with the President?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I’m not asking you about your text message. I’m asking about your conversations with Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor after you spoke with the President, either in that call or in a different call.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, Mr. Morrison testified that you relayed a conversation you had with the President, in which the president told you no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must go to a microphone and announce these investigations and that he should want to. Similarly, you told Ambassador Taylor that while the President said no quid pro quo, unless Zelensky announced these investigations, they would be at a stalemate. Presumably a stalemate over the military assistance. Do you have any reason to question those conversations that Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor took notes about?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Again, Ambassador, I’m not asking about your text message. I’m asking you about what you relayed to Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison about your conversation with the President. Do you have any reason to question their recollection of what you told them?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You don’t recall?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You have no reason to question Ambassador Taylor or Mr. Morrison of what they wrote in their notes about your conversation with them.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I’ll have Mr. Goldman go through that with you.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But let me get to the the top line here, Ambassador Sondland.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You’ve testified that the White House meeting that President Zelensky desperately wanted and that was very important to President Zelensky, was it not?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You’ve testified that that meeting was conditioned was a quid pro quo for what the President wanted, these two investigations, isn’t that right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And that everybody knew it.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now that White House meeting was going to be an official meeting between the two presidents, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	It would be an Oval Office meeting, hopefully.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	A working meeting, so an official act, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And in order to perform that official act, Donald Trump, wanted these two investigations that would help his re-election campaign, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But he had to get those two investigations if that official act was going to take place, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Okay, President Zelensky had to announce the two investigations the President wanted, make a public announcement, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And those were of great value to the President, he was quite insistent upon them and his attorney was insistent upon them?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, and you said that Mr. Giuliani was acting at the President’s demand, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And so that official act of that meeting was being conditioned on the performance of these things the president wanted as expressed both directly and through his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you’ve also testified that your understanding, it became your clear understanding that the military assistance was also being withheld pending Zelensky announcing these investigations, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And in fact, you had a discussion, communication with the Secretary of State, which you said that logjam over aid could be lifted if Zelensky announced these investigations, right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That that’s what you meant, right Ambassador?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, here’s what you said in your testimony a moment ago.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Page 18, “But my goal at the time was to do what was necessary to get the aid released to break the logjam.” Okay, that’s still your testimony, right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So the military aid is also an official act, am I right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	This is not President Trump’s personal bank account he’s writing a check from, this is $400 million of U.S. taxpayer money, is it not?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And there was a logjam, in which the President would not write that U.S. check you believed until Ukraine announced these two investigations the President wanted, correct?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Goldman.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That concludes our 45 minutes. I now recognize Mr. Nunes. Oh, okay. Why don’t we take a five or 10 minute break.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Time of the gentleman has expired. We’ll now move to a second staff led round of 30 minutes. Mr. Volker, I just have a few questions before I turn it back to Mr. Goldman. You testified in response to my colleagues in the minority something along the lines of, “A lot of people did not make the connection between Burisma and Biden.” I think a lot of people have real difficulty understanding that. Tim Morrison testified that I think it took him all of doing a Google search to find out, “Oh, this is the significance of Burisma. It involves the Bidens.” Are you saying during all this time, up until the call, you never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens? You just thought that the president and Rudy Giuliani were interested in this one particular Ukrainian company?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I understand that, but my question is, are you saying that for months and months and I was standing everything Rudy Giuliani was saying on TV and all the discussion with Rudy Giuliani that you never put Burisma together with the Bidens?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Let me ask you this. Ambassador Volker testified yesterday to a similar epiphany, for lack of a better word. This is what he said, “In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different. The former being appropriate and unremarkable. The latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.” Does that sum up your views as well?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now I think you were asked a question with a bit of a incorrect premise by my colleagues in the minority about Fiona Hill saying that referring to a drug deal between you and Mr. Mulvaney was Ambassador Bolton who made the comment that he didn’t want to be part of any drug deal that Ambassador Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking up. No one thinks they’re talking about a literal drug deal here or a drug cocktail. The import I think of the ambassador’s comments is quite clear that he believed that this bargain, this quid pro quo, as you’ve described it over a meeting, the investigations to get the meeting was not something he wanted to be a part of.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	What I want to ask you about is he makes reference in that drug deal to a drug deal cooked up by you and Mulvaney. It’s the reference to Mulvaney that I want to ask you about. You’ve testified that Mulvaney was aware of this quid pro quo of this condition that the Ukrainians had to meet that is announcing these public investigations to get the White House meeting. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Including about including Mr. Mulvaney?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And including the secretary of state?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now, have you seen the acting chief of staff’s press conference in which he acknowledged that the military aid was withheld in part because of a desire to get that 2016 investigation you’ve talked about?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So you saw him acknowledged publicly what you have confirmed too that Mr. Mulvaney understood that two plus two equals four. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And he said yes it was.
2019-11-20	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Goldman.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ask for your respect as we proceed with today?s hearing. It?s the intention of the committee to proceed without disruptions. As chairman, I?ll take all necessary and appropriate steps to maintain order and ensure that the committee is run in accordance with House rules and House Resolution 660. With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Yesterday morning, the Committee heard from Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the American Ambassador to the European Union, the de facto leader of the three amigos, who had regular access to President Donald Trump and pressed the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for two investigations, Trump believed would help his reelection campaign. The first investigation was of a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine and not Russia was responsible for interfering in our 2016 election. The second investigation was into the political rival Trump apparently feared most, Joe Biden. Trump sought to weaken Biden, and to refute the fact that his own election had been helped by a Russian hacking and dumping operation and Russian social media campaign directed by Vladimir Putin.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Trump?s scheme stood in contrast to the longstanding bipartisan foreign policy of the United States by undermining military and diplomatic support for a key ally, and set back US anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. In conditioning a meeting with Zelensky and then military aid on securing an investigation of his rival, Trump put his personal and political interests above those of the United States. Ambassador Sondland would later tell career Foreign Service Officer, David Holmes, immediately after speaking to the president, Trump did not give a expletive about Ukraine. He cares about big stuff that benefits him, like the Biden investigation that Giuliani was pushing.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	David Holmes is here with us today. He is a Foreign Service Officer currently serving as the Political Counselor at the US Embassy in Kyiv. Also with us is Dr. Fiona Hill, whose job as the National Security Council?s Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs encompassed the coordination of US policy towards Ukraine. Dr. Hill left the NSC in July, after more than two years in that position. Dr. Hill and Mr. Holmes each provide a unique perspective on issues relating to Ukraine, Dr. Hill from Washington, DC, and Mr. Holmes from on the ground in Kyiv.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In early 2019, Dr. Hill became concerned by the increasing prominence of Rudy Giuliani, the president?s personal lawyer, who was, as she has testified, asserting quite frequently on television in public appearances that he had been given some authority over matters related to Ukraine. Hill was not alone in her concerns. Her boss, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, was also paying attention, as were other NSC and State Department officials, including Holmes at the US Embassy in Kyiv. Bolton viewed Giuliani as a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up, and was powerless to prevent the former mayor from engineering former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch?s firing in late April or the recall. Holmes was stunned by the intensity and consistency of the media attacks on Yovanovitch, by name as a US Ambassador and the scope of the allegations that were leveled against her.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Yovanovitch?s dismissal as a result of Giuliani?s smear campaign was one of several things that unsettled Dr. Hill. Another was the role of Gordon Sondland, who emerged as a key player in Ukraine policy in May when he was named as part of the US delegation led by Secretary, Rick Perry, to President Zelensky?s inauguration. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, also attended the inauguration, and as Holmes recalls, during a meeting with President Zelensky, took the opportunity to advise the new Ukrainian leader to stay out of US domestic politics.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Another concern that arose for Dr. Hill around this time was her discovery of a potential NSC back channel on Ukraine. Hill learned that an NSC staff member who did not work on Ukraine and for her may have been providing Ukraine-related information to President Trump that Dr. Hill was not made aware of. According to Holmes, following the Zelensky inauguration, Sondland and Perry took a very active and unconventional role in formulating our priorities for the new Zelensky administration and personally reaching out to President Zelensky and his senior team. Sondland?s newfound assertiveness also concerned Dr. Hill, who previously had enjoyed a cordial working relationship with the ambassador.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On June 18, 2019, Hill had a blow-up with Sondland when he told her that he was in charge of Ukraine policy. Dr. Hill testified that Sondland got testy with me. And I said, ?Who has put you in charge of it?? He said, ?The President.? On July 10th, Dr. Hill was part of a meeting at the White House with a group of US and Ukrainian officials, including Bolton, Sondland and Energy Secretary, Perry, another of the three amigos. The meeting was intended, among other things, to give the Ukrainians an opportunity to convey that they were very anxious to set up a meeting, a first meeting between their new president and President Trump. Sondland interjected to inform the group that according to White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, the White House meeting sought by the Ukrainian president with Trump would happen if Ukraine undertook certain investigations. Hearing this, Bolton abruptly ended the meeting.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Undeterred, Sondland brought the Ukrainian delegation and the NSC Director for Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman downstairs to another part of the White House, where they were later joined by Dr. Hill. In this second meeting, Sondland was more explicit. Ukraine needed to conduct investigations if they were to get a meeting at all. Bolton directed Dr. Hill to report this to NSC legal advisor, John Eisenberg, telling her, ?You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go ahead and tell him what you?ve heard and what I?ve said.? Dr. Hill did so, as did Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, who separately approached the same lawyers with his concerns.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On July 18, the day before Dr. Hill left her post at the NSC, Holmes participated in a secure interagency videoconference on Ukraine. Towards the end of the meeting, a representative from the Office of Management and Budget announced that the flow of nearly $400 million in security assistance for Ukraine was being held up. The order had come from the president and had been conveyed to OMB by acting White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, without further explanation. Holmes, unaware of the hold prior to the call, was shocked. He thought the suspension of aid was extremely significant, undermining what he had understood to be longstanding US national security goals in Ukraine.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	One week later, on July 25th, President Trump spoke with President Zelensky by phone. When President Zelensky brought up US military support and noted that Ukraine would like to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States, Trump responded by saying, ?I would like you to do us a favor, though.? Trump then requested that Zelensky investigate the discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election. Even more ominously, Trump asked Zelensky to look into the Bidens. Neither request had been included in the official talking points for the call prepared by the NSC staff, but both were in Donald Trump?s personal interest, and in the interests of his 2020 re-election campaign. And the Ukrainian president knew about both in advance, in part because of efforts by Ambassadors Sondland and Volker to make him aware of President Trump?s demands.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The next day, July 26, in Kyiv, Holmes served as a note-taker during a meeting between acting Ambassador Bill Taylor, Volker and Sondland, with President Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian officials. Zelensky said that on the previous day?s call, President Trump had ?three times? raised some very sensitive issues that he would have to follow up on those issues when they met in person. Although he did not realize it at the time, Holmes came to understand that the sensitive issues were the investigations that President Trump demanded on the July 25th call.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Following the meeting with Zelensky, Holmes accompanied Sondland to a separate meeting with one of the Ukrainian president?s top advisors, Andriy Yermak. But Holmes was not allowed into the meeting and waited for thirty minutes while Sondland and the Ukrainian met alone without any note-takers to record what they said. After the meeting, Sondland, Holmes and two other State Department staff went to lunch at a nearby restaurant and sat on an outdoor terrace. At some point during the meal, Sondland pulled out his cell phone, placed a call to the White House, and asked to be connected to the President.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	When Trump came on the line, Holmes could hear the President?s voice clearly. Holmes recalled that ?the President?s voice was very loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume.? Sondland said he was calling from Kyiv. He told the President that President Zelensky loves your ass. Holmes then heard President Trump ask, ?So he?s going to do the investigation?? Ambassador Sondland replied, ? He?s going to do it,? adding that, ?President Zelensky will do anything you ask him.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	After the call ended, Holmes took the opportunity to ask Sondland for his candid impression of the President?s views on Ukraine. It was at this point that Sondland revealed that President Trump doesn?t give a expletive about Ukraine. The President only cares about big stuff, that benefits the president, like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. A month later, National Security Advisor, Bolton, traveled to Kyiv. Between meetings with Ukrainian government officials, Holmes heard Bolton express to Ambassador Bill Taylor his frustration about Mr. Giuliani?s influence with the President. Bolton made clear, however, there was nothing he could do about it. Bolton further stated that the hold on security assistance would not be lifted prior to the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Zelensky in Warsaw, where it would hang on whether Zelensky was able to favorably impress President Trump.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Trump canceled his trip to Warsaw, but Sondland, Volker and others continued to press for a public announcement of the opening of investigations by Zelensky. On September 8, Taylor told Holmes that, ?Now they?re insisting Zelensky commit to the investigation in an interview with CNN.? Holmes was surprised the requirement was so specific and concrete, since it amounted to nothing less than a ? demand that President Zelensky personally commit to a specific investigation of President Trump?s political rival on a cable news channel.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On September 9, this Committee along with the Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees, launched our investigation of this corrupt scheme. President Trump released the hold on aid two days later. As CNN?s Fareed Zakaria has revealed, the Ukrainians canceled the CNN interview shortly thereafter. Two weeks later, on September 25, the transcript of the July 25th call was released by the White House, and the details of the President?s scheme started coming into view.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In the coming days, Congress will determine what response is appropriate. If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe a vulnerable ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts, a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid, it will be for us to decide whether those acts are compatible with the Office of the Presidency. I now recognize ranking member Nunes for any remarks he would like to make.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Today we are joined by Dr. Fiona Hill and David Holmes. Dr Fiona Hill is a former deputy assistant to the president and senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council. Before returning to government, she was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution where she directed the center on the United States in Europe. She previously worked at the National Intelligence Council, the Eurasia Foundation, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government. David Holmes is the Political Counselor at the US Embassy in Kyiv, where he serves as the Senior Policy and Political Advisor to Ambassador Taylor, who testified earlier in these hearings. He is a career Foreign Service Officer. He has previously served in Moscow, New Delhi, Kabul, Bogota and Pristina. He has also served on the staff of the National Security Council as special assistant to the United States Secretary of State.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Two final points before our witnesses are sworn. First witness depositions as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature, and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information that may touch on classified information will be addressed separately. Second, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat of reprisal or attempt to retaliate against any US government official for testifying before Congress, including you or any of your colleagues. If you would please rise, raise your right hand, I will begin by swearing you in. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God. Let the record show that the witness has answered in the affirmative. Thank you and you may be seated.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The microphones are sensitive, so you?ll need to speak directly into them. Without objection, your written statements will be made part of the record. With that Mr. Holmes, you are now recognized for your opening statement and when you conclude, Dr. Hill, you?ll be immediately recognized thereafter for your opening statement.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Holmes. Dr. Hill.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Is the microphone on?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Yes, perfect.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you, Dr. Hill. I will now proceed to the first round of questions. As detailed in the memo provided the Committee members, there?ll be 45 minutes of questions conducted by the Chairman or Majority Counsel, followed by 45 minutes for the ranking member or Minority Counsel. Following that, unless I specify additional equal time for extended questioning, we will proceed under the five minute rule and every member will have a chance to ask questions. I now recognize myself or Majority Counsel for the first round of questions.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	First of all, thank you both for being here. Thank you for testifying. Dr. Hill, your story reminds me a great deal of what we heard from Alexander Vindman. The few immigrant stories that we?ve heard just in the course of these hearings are among the most powerful I think I?ve ever heard. You and Colonel Vindman and others are the best of this country, and you came here by choice, and we are so blessed that you did. So, welcome.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"My colleagues took some umbrage with your opening statement, but I think the American people can be forgiven if they have the same impression listening to some of the statements of my colleagues during this hearing; that Russia didn?t intervene in our election, it was all the Ukrainians. There?s an effort to take a tweet here, and an op-ed there, and a newspaper story here, and somehow equate it with the systemic intervention that our intelligence agencies found that Russia perpetrated in 2016 through an extensive social media campaign, and a hacking and dumping operation. Indeed, the report my colleagues gave you that they produced during the investigation calls into question the accuracy of the Intelligence Committee?s finding that Russia intervened to help one side, to help Donald Trump at the expense of Hillary Clinton. No one in the Intelligence community questions that finding, nor does the FBI, nor does the Senate bipartisan Intelligence Committee report, nor does the Minority Committee report of this Committee. The house Republican report is an outlier."
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"But let me ask you, Dr. Hill, about your concern with that Russian narrative; that it wasn?t the Russians that engaged in interfering in our election in 2016; and of course this was given a boost when President Trump in Helsinki, in the presence of Putin, said that he questioned his own intelligence agencies. But why are the Russians pushing that narrative, that it was Ukraine? How does that serve Russian interests?"
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"And I quite agree. There?s an additional benefit, and I think you?re absolutely right, the Russians are equal opportunity meddlers. They will not only help one side, but they?ll also just seek to sow discord in the United States along ethnic lines, religious lines, geographic lines. But there?s also a benefit now, isn?t there, for Russia to put the blame on Ukraine; to cast doubt on whether they intervened at all in our election and blame it on a U.S.ally as a way of driving a wedge between the U.S. and Ukraine? Isn?t that true?"
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"Thank you. Mr. Holmes, I want to ask you a quick couple of questions, and I think as often is the case for people ? You know, I was obviously at your deposition, I?ve read your opening testimony; but as you learn more facts, you start to see things in different light, even though your opening statement is very much consistent with your opening statement during the deposition. And I was struck in particular by something you said on page 10 of your opening statement. ?While we had advised our Ukrainian counterparts to voice a commitment to following the rule of law and generally investigating credible corruption allegations, this was a demand that President Zelensky personally commit on a cable news channel to a specific investigation of President Trump?s political rival."
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	This gets to a point I made at the close of our hearing yesterday about hypocrisy. Here we are, and we are urging Ukrainians to commit to following the rule of law as you said, and only investigate genuine and credible allegations. And what are we doing? We?re asking them to investigate the President?s political rival. Ukrainians are pretty sophisticated actors, aren?t they? They can recognize hypocrisy when they see it. What does that do to our anti-corruption efforts when the Ukrainians perceive that we?re engaging in corruption ourselves?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And it hearkens back to that conversation Ambassador Volker testified about when he urged Ukraine not to investigate or prosecute Poroschenko, and the reply from Mr. Yermack was, ?Oh, you mean like you want us to do with the Bidens and the Clintons?? They?re sophisticated enough actors to recognize when we?re saying ?do as we say, not as we do,? are they not?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You also in your testimony, and I was struck by this anew today, when even after the aid is lifted, Ukraine still felt pressured to make these statements, and you and Ambassador Taylor were worried that they were going to do it on CNN. And you said that, ?Ambassador Taylor again stressed the importance of staying out of U.S. politics, and said he hoped no interviews, no interview was planned. Mr. Yermack did not answer, but shrugged in resignation as if to indicate that they had no choice. In short, everyone thought there was going to be an interview and that the Ukrainians believed they had to do it.? So you?re acknowledging, I think Mr. Holmes, are you not that Ukraine very much felt pressured to undertake these investigations that the President, Rudy Giuliani, and Ambassador Sondland and others were demanding?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, and I would underscore again as my colleague did so eloquently, they got caught. That?s the reason the aid was finally lifted. Mr Goldman.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That concludes the majority questioning. We are expected to have votes, I think fairly soon. This would be a appropriate time to break and we?ll resume with the minority 45-minutes. If people before they leave could allow the witnesses to leave first, and if committee members could come back promptly after votes.  Part 3
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Holmes, can you put your microphone on?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That concludes the 45 minute rounds. We?ll now go to member questioning. I?ll recognize myself for five minutes. First, as a threshold matter, I want to say to the witnesses to be a bit cautious when members represent, are you aware of this fact? Are you aware of that fact? Do you know that so-and-so testified to this or testify to that? If you have personal knowledge of it, that?s fine, and I?m not saying this is deliberate, sometimes members get it wrong. So let me just clear the record on one of the things that was suggested to you that the vice president canceled his trip because of a conflict with a trip to Canada. That was not Ms. Williams testimony.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Her testimony was, ?I asked my colleague why we should stop trip planning and why the vice president would not be attending. And I was informed that the president had decided the vice president would not attend the inauguration.? So just offer that caution. Dr. Hill, I?m going to ask you, you may be aware of some of the attacks on Colonel Vindman suggesting that he has a dual loyalty, that he?s not really loyal to America, he?s loyal to Ukraine. I wanted to ask you, as a fellow immigrant, what you think of those kinds of accusations when they?re leveled against Colonel Vindman or other Americans?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you. You mentioned something in your testimony, and I might not have this exactly right, that I think Ambassador Sondland at one point told you his role was to make deals. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I want to ask you-
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I want to ask you about one of those deals. The one that Ambassador Bolton described as a drug deal. I had the suggestion, or the indication rather, when Mr. Goldman was asking you questions about the July 10th meeting and the fact there were two meetings, one in Ambassador Bolton?s presence and another in the Ward Room, that there was more you had to say about that. Do you want to walk us through that in a little more detail?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you. Mr. Nunes.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Nunes, I don?t cut off a witness in the middle of their answer. You may proceed.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Holmes, you may take as long as you need.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Jordan, please do not interrupt the witness any further. Mr. Holmes, Mr. Jordan?s time has expired, but yours has not. You may answer the question.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, please do not interrupt.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, please do not interrupt.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, you will allow the witness to answer the question.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, you may not like the witness?s answer, but we will hear it.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, we will hear the witness?s answer. Have you concluded Mr. Holmes?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Himes.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection. Mr. Conaway.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman has expired.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman ?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Time of the gentleman.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. Sewell, You?re recognized.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Turner.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Is there a question for Dr. Hill?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman has expired.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Carson, you are recognized.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentleman for yielding. Just another fact check and, again, my caution to both of you that representations about what prior witnesses said or what you have even said may not be consistent with the facts. This was from Ambassador Sondland?s opening statement. After this Zelensky meeting, I also met with Zelensky?s senior aide, Andre Yermak. I don?t recall the specifics of our conversation, but I believe the issue of investigations was probably a part of that agenda or meeting. Now recognize Dr. Wenstrup.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Doctor, I was going to ask you if you?d like to respond. There have been a number of gentlemen ?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Gentlemen will suspend. Dr. Hill, you may respond.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you, Dr. Hill. Ms Speier.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Radcliffe.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Conaway, please let Mr.-
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Holmes. [crosstalk 00:05:12]. Your question, sir.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Conaway, your time to yield back.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Holmes, you were cut off when you were talking about Mr. Sondland?s indiscretion. Did you want to finish that answer?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Conaway it?s unfair [crosstalk 02:18:32] .
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	It?s unfair, Mr. Conaway, to interrupt the witnesses as you have done repeat-
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Conaway. The gentleman will cease. We allow the witnesses to answer the question even if those asking the question, don?t want to hear the answer. Mr. Heck, you are-
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Yes, it does.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Welch.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Maloney.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Demings.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Krishnamoorthi.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That concludes the member questioning. We?ll now go to closing statements. Mr. Nunes, do you have any closing remarks?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentleman. First of all, I want to thank you both for your testimony. I want to thank you for your long years of service to the country. You?re not Democratic witnesses or Republican witnesses, you?re nonpartisan witnesses, and you have stuck to the facts, and that is as it should be.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"First, I want to make a couple observations about the hearing today. Dr. Hill, you were criticized several times by my colleagues for your opening statement. I?m glad you didn?t back down from it. You?re much more diplomatic than I am, I have to say. Anyone watching these proceedings, anyone reading the deposition transcripts would have the same impression that you evidently had from hearing my colleagues talk about the Russia hoax, that the whole idea that Russia had gotten involved in the 2016 election was a hoax put out by the Democrats. And of course, they?re not alone in pushing out this idea; it is trumpeted by no one other than the President of the United States who, almost on a daily basis at times, would comment and tweet and propagate the idea that Russia?s interference in our election was a hoax."
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And of course, we all remember that debacle in Helsinki when the president stood next to Vladimir Putin and questioned his own intelligence agencies. I wish I had heard just some of the righteous indignation we heard in the committee today when the president questioned that fundamental conclusion of our intelligence agencies, but of course, they were silent when the president said that. They?ll show indignation today, but they will cower when they hear the president questioning the very conclusions that our intelligence community has reached.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But we saw something interesting also today. My colleagues sought to use you, Dr. Hill, to besmirch the character of Col. Vindman, and I thought this was very interesting. Certainly wasn?t unexpected, but it was very interesting for this reason: They didn?t really question anything Col. Vindman said. After all, what Col. Vindman said is what you?ve said. He was in that July 10th meeting, he heard the same quid pro quo, the same comments by Sondland, ?If you want this meeting, Ukrainians, and we have an agreement about this, you got to announce you?re going to do these investigations.? He heard the same quid pro quo that you did. So why are they smearing him?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"Mr. Holmes, you testified just as Vindman said, Col. Vindman said that he warned Zelensky about getting involved in US politics. They don?t question that, they didn?t take issue with that. So why smear this Purple Heart recipient? Just like the smear of Ambassador Yovanovitch, it?s just gratuitous. They don?t question the facts; it?s just gratuitous. The attack on you, Mr. Holmes, that you were indiscreet in mentioning this conversation to others. Well, I think you?re quite right, the indiscretion is when an ambassador to the EU calls the president on an insecure line in a country known for Russian telecommunications and eavesdropping. That?s more than indiscretion, that?s a security risk."
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But why attack you, Mr. Holmes? They didn?t question anything you said. They didn?t question what conversation you overheard. Ambassador Sondland, indeed, didn?t question what you said. He acknowledged that the one thing the president wanted to know the day after that conversation with Zelensky was, ? Is he going to do the investigations?? And Sondland said, ?Yes, he?ll do anything you ask.? They don?t question that. So why attack you?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	They didn?t question your testimony when you said, and I think you asked Ambassador Sondland, ?Does Donald Trump give a blank,? and I would like to use the word here, ?about Ukraine?? And he said, ?He doesn?t give a blank about Ukraine. He only cares about the big stuff.? And you said, ?Well, there?s some big stuff here. Ukraine?s at war with Russia, that?s kind of big stuff.? And his answer was, ?No, no, no, no, no. He cares about the big stuff that matters to him, his personal interests, like the Biden investigation that Giuliani wants.? I mean, one question posed by your testimony, Mr. Holmes, is what do we care about? Do we care about the big stuff like the Constitution, like an oath of office, or do we only care now about party? What do we care about?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But let?s go beyond your testimony today. Let?s look at the bigger picture. What do we know now after these depositions, these secret depositions? Now, people watching at home might not know that in these secret depositions, which apparently no one else is allowed to hear, no members are allowed to participate, it?s just secret, apparently, sounds like it?s just me and the witness, only over a hundred members of Congress are able to participate in those secret depositions. And the minority was just so unable to participate, they got the same time they got in these open hearings. It was the same format. That was the secret star chamber that you?ve been hearing so much about.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So, what have we learned through these depositions and through the testimony? Because so much of this is really undisputed. We learned that a dedicated public servant named Marie Yovanovitch, known for fighting corruption, widely respected throughout the diplomatic corps, was ruthlessly smeared by Rudy Giuliani, by the president?s own son, by their friends on Fox prime time and a whole host of other characters. Her reputation was sullied so they could get her out of the way, which they did. And you?re right, it was gratuitous. The president could?ve gotten rid of her any time he wanted, but that?s not enough for this president. No, he has to smear and destroy those that get in his way, and someone fighting corruption in Ukraine was getting in his way, so she?s gone. She?s gone.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And this makes way almost immediately thereafter, she leaves, the Three Amigos come in. The Three Amigos, two of whom never made the connection that Burisma means Biden. It took Tim Morrison all of 30 seconds on Google to figure that out. But we?re to believe, I guess, that in all the companies in all the world, that Rudy Giuliani just happens to be interested in this one? That?s absurd. The interest, of course, was in an investigation of Donald Trump?s rival, the one that he apparently feared the most. And they were willing to do whatever was necessary to get Ukraine to do that dirty work, to do that political investigation.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And so it began, ?We?re not going to set up a phone call until you make certain commitments.? That was Ambassador Sondland?s testimony. The first quid pro quo was actually just getting on the phone with President Trump. And then there was the quid pro quo involving the White House meeting, and witness after witness, and none of my colleagues contested this, talked about just how important that meeting was to the president of Ukraine and why? They?re at war with Russia, and their most important ally is the United States, and the most important person in the United States for that relationship is the president of the United States.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And if President Zelensky can show that he has a good relationship with the president of the United States, it means to his people that this new president has the support of their most important patron, and it means to the Russians that we have their back. This president, this new president who is negotiating with a far superior power that has invaded his country, is going into a negotiation with Putin over how to resolve this conflict. Whether he has good leverage or lousy leverage depends on whether the Russians think he has a relationship with the president. And the president wouldn?t give him that, not without getting something in return, wouldn?t give him that official act, that White House meeting, without getting something in return. And that return was investigations of his rival that would help his reelection, an official act for something of clear value and something very important. The big stuff, as Sondland explained to you, Mr. Holmes, to help his campaign.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now, we also heard abundant testimony about the other quid pro quo, the withholding of security assistance, which no one can explain. There?s no debate among my colleagues. Everyone in the NSC, in the State Department, the Defense Department, everyone supported this, everyone. All the reviews that needed to be done to make sure that Ukraine was meeting its anti-corruption standards had been done, and they had found to meet the criteria. The aid should?ve been released, but it was withheld, and no one could understand or get a clear explanation for why, until it became clear to everyone, it?s all about the investigations, it?s all about the leverage.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And if there was any doubt about it, the man closest to the president, who meets with him every day, Mick Mulvaney, erased all doubt. ?You?re darn right. Yes, we talked about the 2016 election investigation, and yes, this was in the context of holding up the military aid, and you know, just get used to it,? or just get over it, or whatever it was he said, ?because that?s how we roll.? Those are my words, not his, but that?s the import. ?Yeah, there?s going to be politics, and just get over it.? Well, if we care about the big stuff, we can?t just get over it.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now, my colleagues have had a lot of defenses to all of this evidence, which has piled up day after day after day. And it?s amazing, they hear you testify, Mr. Holmes, that it was clear that the security assistance was being withheld, it was clear to all of the Americans, it was clear to the Ukrainians. You testified the Ukrainians felt pressure, they still feel pressure to this day. And what do my colleagues say in the same hearing? I mean, I guess they?re not listening. ?The Ukrainians felt no pressure, there?s no evidence they felt pressure.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Which gets into their next defense, which is, ?It?s all hearsay. It?s all hearsay.? Now, most of my colleagues, I guess, are not lawyers. Lawyers out there understand just how wrong they are about what hearsay is, but let?s just discuss this in terms that all people can understand. The impression they would have you take from ?It?s all hearsay? is, because we in this committee were not in that Ward Room with you, Dr. Hill, we were not in that meeting earlier with Dr. Bolton, that because we?re not in the room, it?s all hearsay. After all, you?re relating what you heard, and you?re saying it, so it must be hearsay, and therefore, we don?t really have to think about it, do we? We don?t have to consider that you have direct evidence that this meeting in the White House was being withheld because the president wanted these meetings, these investigations. We can?t accept that.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, if that were true, you could never present any evidence in court unless the jury was also in the Ward Room. That?s absurd. They don?t accept the documentary evidence, all the text messages about quid pro quos, and ?Are we really saying,? and ?That?s crazy,? and ?My worst nightmare is the Russians will get it, and I?ll quit.? They don?t accept the documents, the few documents that we have from the State Department that weren?t produced, by the way, by the State Department, where Sondland communicates directly with the Secretary of State about this investigative interest of the president, and they don?t accept the documents either. I guess the documents are also hearsay.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now, might be a little more convincing if they were joining us in demanding that the documents be produced, but of course they?re not. And we know why not, because the documents are like that one we saw on the screen. They implicate others, including Secretary Pompeo, so of course Donald Trump and Secretary Pompeo don?t want us to see those documents.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But apparently, it?s all hearsay. Even when you actually hear the president, Mr. Holmes, that?s hearsay. We can?t rely on people saying what the president said. Apparently, we can only rely on what the president says, and there, we shouldn?t even rely on that either. We shouldn?t really rely on what the president said in the call record. We should imagine he said something else. We should imagine he said something about actually fighting corruption, instead of what he actually said, which was, ?I want you to do us a favor, though. I want you to look into this 2016 CrowdStrike conspiracy theory, and I want you to look into the Bidens.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I guess we?re not even supposed to rely on that because that?s hearsay. Well, that?s absurd. That would be like saying you can?t rely on the testimony of the burglars during Watergate because it?s only hearsay, or you can?t consider the fact that they tried to break in because they got caught. They actually didn?t get what they came for, so, you know, kind of no harm, no foul. That?s absurd. That?s absurd.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But the other defense besides ?It failed, the scheme failed, they got caught,? the other defense is ?The president denies it.? Well, I guess that?s case closed, right? The president says, really quite spontaneously, it?s not as if he was asked in this way, ? No quid pro quo.? ?What do you want from Ukraine?? ?No quid pro quo.? This is the ?I?m not a crook? defense. You say it, and I guess that?s the end of it.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, the only thing we can say is that it?s not so much that this situation is different in terms of Nixon?s conduct and Trump?s conduct. What we?ve seen here is far more serious than a third-rate burglary of the Democratic headquarters. What we?re talking about here is the withholding of recognition in that White House meeting, the withholding of military aid to an ally at war. That is beyond anything Nixon did.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The difference between then and now is not the difference between Nixon and Trump, it?s the difference between that Congress and this one. And so, we are asking, where is Howard Baker? Where is Howard Baker? Where are the people who are willing to go beyond their party to look to their duty? I was struck by Col. Vindman?s testimony because he said that he acted out of duty. What is our duty here? That?s what we need to be asking, not using metaphors about balls and strikes, or our team and your team. I?ve heard my colleagues use those metaphors. This should be about duty. What is our duty?
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We are, and this gets to Mr. Heck?s point, we are the indispensable nation. We still are. People look to us from all over the world. Journalists from their jail cells in Turkey, the victims of mass extrajudicial killing in the Philippines, people who gathered in Tahrir Square wanting a representative government, people in China who are Uighurs, people in Ukraine who want a better future, they look to us. They?re not going to look to the Russians, they?re not going to look to the Chinese, they can?t look to Europe with all its problems. They still look to us, and increasingly, they don?t recognize what they see, because what they see is Americans saying, ?Don?t engage in political prosecutions,? and what they say back is, ?Oh, you mean like the Bidens and the Clintons that you want us to investigate?? What they see, they don?t recognize. And that is a terrible tragedy for us, but it?s a greater tragedy for the rest of the world.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now, I happen to think that when the founders provided a mechanism in the Constitution for impeachment, they were worried about what might happen if someone unethical took the highest office in the land and used it for their personal gain, and not because of deep care about the big things that should matter, like our national security and our defense and our allies, and what the country stands for. I happen to think that?s why they put that remedy in the Constitution.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I think we need to consult our conscience and our constituents and decide whether that remedy is appropriate here, whether that remedy is necessary here. And as you know, notwithstanding what my colleagues said, I resisted going down this path for a long time, but I will tell you why I could resist no more, and it came down to this. It came down to, actually, it came down to timing. It came down to the fact that the day after Bob Mueller testified? The day after Bob Mueller testified that Donald Trump invited Russian interference, ?Hey, Russia, if you?re listening, come get Hillary?s emails,? and later that day, they tried to hack her server. The day after he testified that not only did Trump invite that interference, but that he welcomed the help in the campaign, they made full use of it, they lied about it, they obstructed the investigation into it, and all this is in his testimony and his report. The day after that, Donald Trump is back on the phone asking another nation to involve itself in another US election.
2019-11-21	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That says to me this president believes he is above the law, beyond accountability. And in my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law. And I would just say to people watching here at home and around the world, in the words of my great colleague, we are better than that. Adjourned.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Order. Good morning, everyone. This is the second in a series of public hearings the committee will be holding as part of the House’s impeachment inquiry. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recess of the committee at any time. There is a quorum present. We will proceed today in the same fashion as our first hearing. I’ll make an opening statement, and then Ranking Member, Nunes, will have the opportunity to make a statement. Then we will turn to our witness for an opening statement and then to questions. For audience members, we welcome you and respect your interest in being here. In turn, we ask for your respect as we proceed with today’s hearing.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	It is the intention of the committee to proceed without disruptions. As chairman, I will take all necessary and appropriate steps to maintain order and to ensure that the committee is run in accordance with House rules and House Resolution 660. With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In April 2019, the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was in Kiev when she was called by a senior State Department official and told to get on the next plane back to Washington. Upon her return to DC, she was informed by her superiors that although she had done nothing wrong, she could no longer serve as ambassador to Ukraine because she did not have the confidence of the president. It was a stunning turn of events for this highly-regarded career diplomat who had done such a remarkable job fighting corruption in Ukraine that a short time earlier she had been asked by the State Department to extend her tour. Ambassador Yovanovitch has been in the Foreign Service for 33 years and served much of that time in the former Soviet Union.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Her parents had fled Stalin and later Hitler, before settling in the United States. She is an exemplary officer who is widely praised and respected by her colleagues. She is known as an anti-corruption champion whose tour in Kiev was viewed as very successful. Ambassador Michael McKinley who had served with her in the Foreign Service for several decades stated that from the earliest days of her career in the Foreign Service she was excellent, serious, committed. I certainly remember her being one of those people who seemed to be destined for greater things. Her successor who is acting chief of mission in Ukraine, Ambassador Bill Taylor, described her as very frank. She was very direct. She made points very clearly and she was indeed tough on corruption. And she named names. And that sometimes is controversial out there, but she’s a strong person and made those charges.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In her time in Kiev, Ambassador Yovanovitch was tough on corruption, too tough on corruption for some, and her principled stance made her enemies. As George Kent told this committee on Wednesday, you can’t promote principled anti-corruption action without pissing off corrupt people. And Ambassador Yovanovitch did not just piss off corrupt Ukrainians like the corrupt former Prosecutor General, Yuriy Lutsenko, but also certain Americans, like Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump’s personal attorney, and two individuals now indicted who worked with him, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Lutsenko, Giuliani, Fruman, Parnas and others who had come to include the president’s own son, Don Jr., promoted a smear campaign against her based on false allegations. At the State Department there was an effort to push back to obtain a statement of support from Secretary Pompeo, but those efforts failed when it became clear that President Trump wanted her gone. Some have argued that a president has the ability to nominate or remove any ambassador he wants, that they serve at the pleasure of the president, and that is true. The question before us is not whether Donald Trump could recall an American ambassador with a stellar reputation for fighting corruption in Ukraine, but why would he want to? Why did Rudy Giuliani want her gone, and why did Donald Trump?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And why would Donald Trump instruct the new team he put in place, the three amigos, Gordon Sondland, Rick Perry and Kurt Volker, to work with the same man, Rudy Giuliani, who played such a central role in the smear campaign against her? Rudy Giuliani has made no secret of his desire to get Ukraine to open investigations into the Bidens, as well as a conspiracy theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. As he said in one interview in May 2019, we’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do. More recently, he told CNN’s Chris Cuomo, “Of course I did,” when asked if he had pressed Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. And he has never been shy about who he is doing this work for, his client, the president.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	One powerful ally Giuliani had in Ukraine to promote these political investigations was Lutsenko, the corrupt former Prosecutor General. And one powerful adversary Lutsenko had was a certain United States ambassador named Marie Yovanovitch. It is no coincidence that in the now infamous July 25th call with Zelensky, Donald Trump brings up a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor and praises him. Against all evidence, Trump claims that this former Prosecutor General was very good, and he was shut down, and that’s really unfair. But the woman known for fighting corruption, his own former ambassador, the woman ruthlessly smeared and driven from her post, the president does nothing but disparage, or worse, threaten.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, she’s going to go through some things, the president declares. That tells you a lot about the president’s priorities and intentions. Getting rid of Ambassador Yovanovitch helped to set the stage for an irregular channel that could pursue the two investigations that mattered so much to the president, the 2016 conspiracy theory, and most important, an investigation into the 2020 political opponent he apparently feared most, Joe Biden. And the president’s scheme might have worked but for the fact that the man who would succeed Ambassador Yovanovitch, whom we heard from on Wednesday, Acting Ambassador Taylor, would eventually discover the effort to press Ukraine into conducting these investigations and would push back, but for the fact also that someone blew the whistle.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador Yovanovitch was serving our nation’s interest in fighting corruption in Ukraine, but she was considered an obstacle to the furtherance of the president’s personal and political agenda. For that, she was smeared and cast aside. The powers of the presidency are immense, but they are not absolute. And they cannot be used for corrupt purpose. The American people expect their president to use the authority they grant him in the service of the nation, not to destroy others to advance his personal or political interests. I now recognize Ranking Member Nunes for his remarks.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentlewoman is not recognized. I do want to comment and allow-
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentlewoman will state her point of order.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentlewoman will suspend. That is not a proper point of order. The gentlewoman will suspend. I do-

0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman is not recognized.

0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman is not recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The ranking member was allowed to exceed the opening statement and I was happy to allow him to do so. I do want to respond to the call record. First of all, I’m grateful the president has released the call record. I would now ask the president to release the thousands of other records that he has instructed the State Department not to release, including Ambassador Taylor’s notes, including Ambassador Taylors cable, including George Kent’s memo, including documents from the Office of Management and Budget about why the military aide was withheld, including-
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman is not recognized. The gentleman will suspend.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman will suspend.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We would ask the president to stop obstructing the impeachment inquiry. And while we are grateful he has released a single document, he has nonetheless obstructed witnesses and their testimony and the production of thousands and thousands of other records. And finally, I would say this, Mr. President, I hope you will explain to the country today why it was after this call and while the Vice President was making plans to attend the inauguration and you instructed the Vice President not to attend Zelensky’s inauguration.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Today-
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentlewoman is not recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentlewoman is not recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Today… no.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman is not recognized. Today we are joined by a master Marie Yovanovitch. She was born in Canada to parents who fled the Soviet Union and the Nazis. Ambassador Yovanovitch immigrated to Connecticut at three, became a naturalized American at 18, and entered the US Foreign Service in 1986. She has served as US ambassador three times and been nominated by presidents of both parties. George W. Bush nominated her to be ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic where she served from 2005 to 2008. President Obama then nominated her to be US ambassador to Armenia where she served from 2008 until 2011 and US ambassador to Ukraine where she served from 2016 until she was recalled to Washington by President Trump this May.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Beyond these ambassadorial posts, she has held numerous other senior positions at the State Department including in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. She served as a dean at the Foreign Service Institute and taught National Security Strategy at the Defense University. She also previously served at US embassies in Kiev, Ottawa, Moscow, London and Mogadishu. Ambassador Yovanovitch has received multiple honors from the department for her diplomatic work, including the Presidential Distinguished Service Award and the Secretary’s Diplomacy in Human Rights Award. Two final points before our witness is sworn. First, witness deposition as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information that may touch on classified information will be addressed separately. Second, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat of reprisal or attempt to retaliate against any US government official for testifying before Congress including you or any of your colleagues.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	If you would please rise and raise your right hand, I will begin by swearing you in. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you’re about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Let the record show that the witness has answered in the affirmative. Thank you and please be seated. Without objection, your written statement will be made part of the record. With that, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, you are recognized for your opening statement.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And ambassador, you’ll need to speak very close to the microphone.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you, Ambassador. We count ourselves lucky to have you serve the country as you have for decades. We will now move to the 45 minute rounds. I recognize myself and majority counsel for 45 minutes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you again for appearing today. All Americans are deeply in your debt. And before I hand it over to Mr. Goldman, our staff counsel, I want to ask you about a few of the pivotal events of interest to the country. First of all, was fighting corruption in Ukraine a key element of US policy and one in which you placed the highest priority?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And can you explain why?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I know this may be awkward for you to answer since it’s a question about yourself and your reputation, but is it fair to say that you earned a reputation for being a champion of anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I don’t know if you had a chance to watch George Kent’s testimony yesterday, but would you agree with his rather frank assessment that if you fight corruption, you’re going to piss off some corrupt people?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And in your efforts fighting corruption to advance US policy interests, did you anger some of the corrupt leaders in Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Was one of those corrupt people Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Was another one of those corrupt people Lutsenko’s predecessor another corrupt Prosecutor General named Viktor Shokin?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	At some point did you come to learn that both Lutsenko and Shokin were in touch with Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s lawyer and representative?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In fact, did Giuliani try to overturn a decision that you participated in to deny Shokin a visa?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And that was denial was based on Mr. Shokin’s corruption?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And was it Mr. Lutsenko, among others, who coordinated with Mr. Giuliani to pedal false accusations against you as well as the Bidens?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And were these smears also amplified by the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr. as well as certain hosts on Fox?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In the face of this smear campaign, did colleagues at the State Department try to get a statement of support for you from Secretary Pompeo?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Were they successful?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Did you come to learn that they couldn’t issue such a statement because they feared it would be undercut by the president?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And then were you told that though you had done nothing wrong you did not enjoy the confidence of the president and could no longer serve as ambassador?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In fact, you flew home from Kiev on the same day as the inauguration of Ukraine’s new president?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That inauguration was attended by three who have become known as the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Volker and Perry, was it?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And three days after that inauguration, in a meeting with President Trump, are you aware that the president designated these three amigos to coordinate Ukraine policy with Rudy Giuliani?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	This is the same Rudy Giuliani who orchestrated the smear campaign against you?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And the same Rudy Giuliani who during the now infamous July 25th, phone call the President recommended to Zelensky in the context of the two investigations the president wanted into the 2016 election and the Bidens?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And finally ambassador, in that July 25th phone call, the president praises one of these corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutors and says they were treated very unfairly. They were treated unfairly, not you was smeared and recalled, but one of them. What message does that send to your colleagues in the US Embassy in Kiev?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Did you have concern though or do you have concern today about what message the president’s actions sends to the people who were still in Ukraine representing the United States when a well respected ambassador can be smeared out of her post with the participation and acquiescence of the president of the United States?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Is it fair to say that other ambassadors and others of lesser rank who serve the United States in embassies around the world might look at this and think if I take on corrupt people in these countries that could happen to me?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Goldman.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, if I could follow up on that question, it seems like an appropriate time. Ambassador Yovanovitch, as we sit here testifying the president is attacking you on Twitter, and I’d like to give you a chance to respond, I’ll read part of one of his tweets. “Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?” He goes on to say later in the tweet, “It is the US president’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.” First of all, Ambassador Yovanovitch, the Senate has a chance to confirm or deny an ambassador, do they not?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But would you like to respond to the president’s attack that everywhere you went turned bad?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador, you’ve shown the courage to come forward today and testify notwithstanding the fact you were urged by the White House or State Department not to, notwithstanding the fact that, as you testified earlier, the president implicitly threatened you in that call record. And now the president in real-time is attacking you. What effect do you think that has on other witnesses’ willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	It’s designed to intimidate, is it not?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, I want to let you know, Ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously. Mr. Goldman.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman will suspend. Votes are fairly imminent. We’re going to take a brief recess. I would ask everyone to remain seated-
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	To allow the witness to exit the room, and we will resume after votes.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman can seek recognition after we resume.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We will come to order.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Gentleman will state his inquiry.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman… The TV for the witnesses wasn’t working, so they were given copies this morning. It is now 45 minutes to ranking member Nunes. [crosstalk 00:01:37].
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	My understanding is the screen was not working in front of them, so they were given copies so they could read along since they can’t see the screens that we can. Mr. Nunes, you’re recognized for 45 minutes along with minority counsel.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentlewoman will suspend.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized. Mr. Nunes, you or minority counsel-
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Under the House Resolution 660, you are not allowed to yield time except to minority counsel.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Nope, that is not accurate.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Gentlewoman will suspend. You’re not recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You’re not recognized. The gentlewoman will suspend.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Nunes, you or minority council are recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank the gentleman. We’ll now go to a number of five-minute rounds. I recognize myself for five minutes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to follow up on some of the questions from my colleagues. Some of the early questions seem to suggest that your testimony here was completely irrelevant to the issues at hand. Why are you even here? Isn’t this just some small matter that should have been referred to HR?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So I want to bring our attention to someone who thought you were actually very important to this whole plot or scheme and that is the President of the United States. There was only one ambassador, I believe, who was discussed by the president and the July 25th call, and that was you, Ambassador Yovanovitch. I want to refer back to how you were brought up in that conversation.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	At one point during the conversation, the president brings up this prosecutor who was very good and it was shut down, and that’s really unfair. I think you indicated earlier that that was a likely reference to Mr. Lutsenko, the prosecutor. Is that right?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So immediately after the president brings up this corrupt former prosecutor, only one … I’m sorry, my staff has corrected me. Only one American ambassador is brought up in the call. Immediately after the president brings up this corrupt prosecutor that he praises and says he was treated very unfairly, he then encourages Zelensky to speak with Giuliani, the guy who orchestrated the smear campaign against you, correct?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And he then brings you up. So he praises the corrupt prosecutor. He says, “I want you to talk to Giuliani,” the guy who smeared you, and then he brings you up. He obviously thought you were relevant to this, but what is even more telling is immediately after he brings you up and says that you … “The woman was bad news.” He says, “There’s a lot to talk about about Biden’s son.” That Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Immediately after praising this corrupt prosecutor he attacks you and then he goes right to Biden. That would indicate to you, wouldn’t it, Ambassador, that he connects you somehow with this prosecutor you are at odds with and his desire to see this investigation of Biden go forward, would it not?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	My colleagues also asked in pushing you out of the way, ultimately Ambassador Taylor got appointed. Is Ambassador Taylor the kind of person that would further Giuliani’s aims? I think we can all agree that Ambassador Taylor is a remarkable public servant.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But what if the president could put someone else in place that wasn’t a career diplomat? What if he could put in place, say, a substantial donor to his inaugural? What if he could put in place someone with no diplomatic experience at all? What if he put in place someone whose portfolio doesn’t even include Ukraine? Might that person be willing to work with Rudy Giuliani in pursuit of these investigations?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That’s exactly what happened, wasn’t it?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And my colleagues also say, “Well, the security assistance ultimately went through,” so if they sought to condition or bribe Ukraine into doing these investigations by withholding security assistance, they ultimately paid them money. Are you aware, Ambassador, that the security systems was not released until after a whistleblower complaint made its way to the white house?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Are you aware that it was not released until Congress announced it was doing an investigation?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And finally, I want to ask you about the call record that my colleague read at the outset. I’m curious about this, and just for people watching at home so they’re not confused, there are two calls here. There’s the perfunctory congratulatory call after Zelensky is inaugurated, which my ranking member read this morning. And then there’s, of course, the very problematic call in July.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	One of the reasons we are here is what happened between April and July. But there was a readout put out by the White House at the time the April congratulatory call was made, and the White House readout said that the president discussed with Zelensky helping Ukraine root out corruption. Now, that, in fact, doesn’t appear anywhere in that call. So I want to ask you Ambassador, why would the White House put out an inaccurate reading? Why would the White House represent that the president said something about corruption when he said nothing about corruption in that call or, in fact, in the one in July?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank you. Five minutes now to recognize the ranking member.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You may yield. Ms. Stefanik.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Himes, you’re recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Conaway.

0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection. The time of the gentleman has expired. I now recognize Ms. Sewell.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Turner.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman will suspend.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman will suspend. Ambassador Yovanovitch had not finished her answer. You may finish your answer, Ambassador.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Nope. Ambassador. Ambassador will be recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman has expired.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman’s time has expired. Mr. Carson, you’re recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Dr. Wenstrup.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Of course.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Representative Speer.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Stewart, you’re recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We can take that up later. Mr. Stewart, you’re recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman has expired.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We will take up … I may recognize you later. The gentleman’s time has expired.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Quigley, you’re recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Quigley, you’re recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I want to follow up on Mr. Quigley’s line of question, and also harken back to something you were asked by minority council earlier. You were asked a couple of questions. Do you think you could have done more to push back against this smear campaign? And I’m not suggesting this is what the council was getting at, but sometimes victims are asked, “Aren’t you responsible for your own victimization?” What would you say to people who say, “Isn’t it kind of your fault, Ambassador, that you didn’t fight your own smear harder?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I quite agree. Representative Stefanik.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Swalwell.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection.

0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Time of the gentleman has expired.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman has expired. Mr. [crosstalk 02:09:47].
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman will suspend. The gentleman will suspend.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Your time has expired.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Heck, you’re recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You’re not recognized. Mr. Heck, you are.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentlemen. I understand that the witness for counsel would like to take a short break. Let’s take a five minute recess.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	If members of the audience could please remain in the seats to allow the witness for counsel to leave ahead of us. We will resume in a few minutes. We are in recess.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Time for the gentleman has expired, but I’ll allow you to repeat the question.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, I have indulged you with extra time but-
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	… indulgence is wearing out.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	There is a question, right?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I’m about to gavel you down. So if you have a question, I suggest you-
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, please allow the ambassador to answer the question.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, your time is up.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, your time has expired. Mr. Welch, you are recognized.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Maloney.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Demings.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentlewoman. I’m going to go to Mr. Krishnamoorthi.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Nunes, do you have any concluding remarks?
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	No, I have some Chairman concluding remarks. Ambassador, I want to thank you for your decades of service. I want to thank you, as Mr. Mr. Maloney said, for being the first one through the gap.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"What you did in coming forward, and answering a lawful subpoena, was to give courage to others that also witnessed wrongdoing, that they too could show the same courage that you have, that they could stand up, speak out, answer questions; they could endure whatever threats, insults, may come their way. And so in your long and distinguished career, you have done another great public service in answering the call of our subpoena and testifying before us today."
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I think you gathered from our comments that we not only grieve for what you went through, but what damage is being done to the State Department, to career Foreign Service Officers, all over the country. I am profoundly grateful to you and Mr. Kent, and Ambassador Taylor, who have done so much in the last two days, or three days, to show the American people the face of our diplomatic corps, the extraordinary public servants who work all around the world in very dangerous places as you have.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And so I’m glad they’ve gotten to see you. Because you’re often vilified as bureaucrats, or diplomacy is diminished as unimportant. Anything other than the military doesn’t really matter, when it’s your efforts that often prevent us from going to war. Sometimes you are disparaged as the deep state. But what you are is what holds this country together, what holds our foreign policy together, what makes it seamless, what makes it work. And I’m glad America gets to see that.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I will just emphasize, once again, about the importance of your testimony. Mr. Kent and Ambassador Taylor gave us the broad outlines of this story. This is a story about an effort to coerce, condition, or bribe a foreign country into doing the dirty work of the President: investigations of his political rival by conditioning U.S. taxpayer money, by conditioning a meeting that President Zelensky desperately wanted and needed to establish that relationship with the most powerful patron of Ukraine, the United States of America.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"The fact that they failed in this solicitation of bribery doesn’t make it any less bribery, doesn’t make it any less immoral or corrupt. It just means it was unsuccessful. And to that we owe other dedicated public servants who blew the whistle; had they not blown the whistle, we wouldn’t be here. And I think it is appalling that my colleagues continue to want to out this whistleblower so that he or she can be punished by this president."
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"But let’s underscore once again: While you are the beginning of this story, you’re not the end of it; but nonetheless the beginning is important, because the beginning of the story is an effort to get you out of the way. An effort by Rudy Giuliani, and Fruman and Parnas, and corrupt Ukrainians like Lutsenko, to get you out of the way because they felt you were an impediment to these political investigations the Presence of desperately wanted."
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"Giuliani has made it abundantly clear: He was in Ukraine, on a mission for his client; for the President to investigate the Bidens. And you are viewed as an obstacle that had to go; not just by Giuliani, but by the President of the United States. And if people had any doubt about it, they should do what the president asks: Read the transcript."
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And what they’ll see in that transcript is, the President praises the corrupt. He praises the corrupt Lutsenko. He condemns the just, you. And then he asks for an investigation of the Bidens. There is no camouflaging that corrupt intent.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We are adjourned.
0201-11-15	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Please, allow the witness to leave-
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Committee will come to order. Good afternoon. This is the fourth in a series of public hearings the committee will be holding as part of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. There is a quorum present. We will proceed today in the same fashion as our other hearings. I’ll make an opening statement and then the ranking member will have an opportunity to make his opening statement. Then we will turn to our witnesses for opening statements and then two questions.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States. This afternoon, we will hear from two witnesses requested by the minority: Ambassador Kurt Volker, the state department Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations and Tim Morrison, the former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council. I appreciate the minority’s request for these two important witnesses as well as under secretary of state David Hale from whom we will hear tomorrow.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	As we have heard from other witnesses, when Joe Biden was considering whether to enter the race for the presidency in 2020, the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, began a campaign to weaken Vice President Biden’s candidacy by pushing Ukraine to investigate him and his son. To clear away any obstacle to the scheme, days after the new Ukrainian president was elected, Trump ordered the recall of Marie Yovanovitch, the American ambassador in Kyiv who was known for pushing anti-corruption efforts.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Trump also canceled Vice President Mike Pence’s participation in the inauguration of President Zelensky on May 20th and instead sent a delegation headed by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and ambassador Kurt Volker. These three returned from Kyiv and briefed President Trump on their encouraging first interactions with the new Ukrainian administration. Hopes that Trump would agree to an early meeting with the Ukrainian president were soon diminished, however, when Trump pushed back.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	According to Volker, he just didn’t believe it. He was skeptical, and he also said, “That’s not what I hear. I hear he’s got some terrible people around him.” President Trump also told them he believed that Ukraine tried to take him down. He told the three Amigos, “Talk to Rudy,” and they did. One of those interactions took place a week before the July 25th phone call between Trump and Zelensky when Ambassador Volker had breakfast with Rudy Giuliani at the Trump Hotel. Volker testified that he pushed back on Giuliani’s accusation against Joe Biden.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On July 22nd, just days before Trump would talk to Zelensky, Ambassador Volker had a telephone conference with Giuliani and Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to the Ukrainian president so that Giuliani could be introduced to Yermak. On July 25th, the same day as the call between President Trump and Zelensky, but before it took place, Ambassador Volker sent a text message to Yermak, “Heard from the White House. Assuming president Z convinces Trump, he will investigate/get to the bottom of what happened in 2016. We will nail down date for a visit to Washington. Good luck!
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Later that day, Donald Trump would have the now-infamous phone call with Zelensky in which he responded to Ukraine’s appreciation for US defense support and a request by President Zelensky to buy more javelin anti-tank missiles by saying, ” I would like you to do us a favor though.” The favor involved the two investigations that Giuliani had been pushing for into the Bidens in 2016. Ambassador Volker was not on the call, but when asked about what it reflected, he testified, “No president of the United States should ask a foreign leader to help interfere in a US election.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Among those listening in on the July 25th call was Tim Morrison who had taken over as the NSC senior director for European affairs at the NSC only days before, but had been briefed by his predecessor, Fiona Hill, about the irregular second channel that was operating in parallel to the official one. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, from whom we heard this morning, like them, Morrison emerged from the call troubled. He was concerned enough about what he heard on the July 25th call that he went to see the NSC legal advisors soon after it had ended.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Colonel Vindman’s fear was that the president had broken the law potentially, but Morrison said that his concern was that the call could be damaging if it were leaked. Soon after this discussion with lawyers at the NSC, the call record was hidden away on a secure server used to store highly classified intelligence where it remained until late September when the call record was publicly released. Following the July 25th call, Ambassador Volker worked with Sondland and the Ukrainian president’s close adviser, Yermak, on a statement that would satisfy Giuliani. When Yermak sent over a draft that’s still failed to include the specific words Burisma and 2016, Giuliani said the statement would lack credibility. Ambassador Volker then added both Burisma and 2016 to the draft statement. Both Volker and Morrison were, by late July, aware that the security assistance had been cut off at the direction of the president and acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. As the Ukrainians became aware of the suspension of security assistance and the negotiations over the scheduling of a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky dragged on, the pressure increased and any pretense that there was no linkage soon dropped away.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Morrison accompanied Vice President Pence to Warsaw on September 1st where Pence and Zelensky met, and Zelensky raised the suspended security assistance. Following that meeting, Sondland approached Yermak to tell him that he believed that what could help move the aid was if the Ukrainian prosecutor general would go to the mic and announced that he was opening the Burisma investigation. On September 7th, Ambassador Sondland had a telephone call with Trump and asked him what he wanted from Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	According to Morrison, who spoke with Sondland after the call, Trump insisted that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must personally announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it. Sondland also said that if President Zelensky didn’t agree to make a public statement about the investigations, the US and Ukraine would be at a stalemate, meaning it would not receive the much-needed security assistance.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Morrison had a sinking feeling after the call as he realized that the ask was now being directed at Zelensky himself and not the prosecutor general as Sondland had relayed to a senior Ukrainian aid in Warsaw on September 1st. While President Trump claim there was no quid pro quo, his insistence that Zelensky himself must publicly announce the investigations or they’d be at a stalemate made clear that leads to official act White House meeting and 400 million in military aid were conditioned on receipt of what Trump wanted, the investigations to help his campaign.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The efforts to secure the investigations would continue for several more days, but appear to have abruptly ended soon after the three committees of Congress announced an investigation into the Trump-Giuliani Ukraine scheme only then would the aide be released. I now recognize ranking member Nunes for any remarks that he’d like to make.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentlemen. We are joined this afternoon by Ambassador Kurt Volker and Mr. Timothy Morrison. Ambassador Kurt Volker served in the US Foreign Service for nearly 30 years working on European and Eurasian political and security issues under five different presidential administrations. During the George W. Bush administration, he served as the acting director for European and Eurasian affairs in the National Security Council and later as a deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. In 2008, President Bush appointed Ambassador Kurt Volker to the United States permanent representative to NATO where he served until May 2009. In July 2017, Ambassador Kurt Volker was appointed to be the US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations serving in that position until he resigned in September. It is pleasure to welcome Mr. Morrison back to the legislative branch where he served for almost two decades as a Republican staffer. He was a professional staff member for Representative Mark Kennedy of Minnesota, and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Later, Mr. Morrison served as the longtime policy director for the Republican staff of the House Armed Services Committee. In July 2018, Mr. Morrison joined the National Security Council as senior director for countering weapons of mass destruction. Following the departure of Dr. Fiona Hill in July 2019, Mr. Morrison assumed the position of senior director for Russia and Europe.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Two final points before the witnesses are sworn. First witness depositions as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information that may touch on classified information will be addressed separately. Second, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat of reprisal or attempt to retaliate against any US government official for testifying before Congress, including you or any of your colleagues.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	If you’ll both please rise and raise your right hand, I will begin by swearing you in. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you’re about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Let the record show that the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you and please be seated. The microphones are sensitive so please speak directly into them without objection. Your written statements will also be made part of the record.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	With that Mr. Morrison, you are recognized for your opening statement and immediately thereafter Ambassador Volker, you’re recognized for your opening statement.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you. Ambassador Volker.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you gentlemen for your opening statements, we’ll now proceed to the first round of questions. As detailed in the memo provided to the committee members, there’ll be 45 minutes of questions conducted by the chairman or majority counsel followed by 45 minutes for the ranking member or minority counsel. Following that, unless I specify additional equal time for extended questioning, we’ll proceed under the five minute rule and every member will have a chance to ask questions. I now recognize myself or counsel for the first round of questions.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador Volker, I was going to just yield to the minority counsel, but there are a couple points that you made in your opening statement that I wanted to ask about first. First you said that now, former Attorney General Lutsenko was not credible. Mr. Lutsenko is the author of a number of allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch, a number of allegations that were shared with John Solomon of The Hill, a number of allegations that have been repeatedly brought up by my Republican colleagues. Why is it that you found Mr. Lutsenko not credible and told Mr. Giuliani?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador, let me also ask you about the allegations against Joe Biden because that has been a continuing refrain from some of my colleagues as well. Why was it you found the allegations against Joe Biden related to his son or Burisma not to be believed?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And finally, Ambassador, before I turn it over, I was struck by something you said on page eight of your statement, which reads, “In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company, Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as different, the former being appropriate and unremarkable. The latter being unacceptable. In retrospect,” you said, “I should have seen that connection differently and had I done so I would have raised my own objections.” What is it now, Ambassador, in retrospect, that you recognize that you didn’t at this time that leads you to conclude that you would or should have raised these objections?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, one of those people who sought synonymous turns out to be the President of the United States. I take it you didn’t know until the call record was released that the President in that call doesn’t raise Burisma, He asked for an investigation of the Bidens, is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I take it since you say that you acknowledge that asking for an investigation of the Bidens would have been unacceptable and objectionable. That had the President asked you to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens you would have told him so.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Goldman.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That concludes the majority 45 minutes. Before I turn to the minority, are you both in your council okay? Or do you need a break? Okay. Ranking member Nunes, you’re recognized for 45 minutes.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well Ambassador and Mr. Morrison, I have some bad news for you. TV ratings are way down, way down. Don’t hold it personally. I don’t think it’s you guys. But whatever drug deal the Democrats are cooking up here on the dais, American people aren’t buying it. I know you both answered this in your opening statements, but I just want to bring a little more clarity to it. Mr. Morrison, I’ll start with you. Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you were the top person for Ukraine in the White House, correct? At the NSC level?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Reporting to Ambassador Bolton.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador Volker, You have a storied career. We’re very thankful for your service. And you were the special Envoy to Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	did anyone at the White House ever ask you to bribe or extort anything out of anyone at any time?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you. I want to thank you both for being here. And I’ll yield to Mr. Caster.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Okay. Why don’t we take a five or 10 minute break? If I could ask the audience to allow the witnesses to leave the room first. We are in recess.  Part 2
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We’re now going to proceed to a 15 minute round by either chair in majority or ranking member of minority. Mr Goldman, you’re recognized for 15 minutes.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	15 minutes to ranking member Nunes.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I don’t know how magical they are. They’re prescribed by House Resolution 660. That we can have successive rounds of up to 45 minutes. So this is part of the prescribed procedure under the House Resolution.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I do not expect more will be necessary.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The House rules don’t permit that, Mr. Nunes.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We’ll now go to five minute member questions. I recognize myself for five minutes. Ambassador Volker, I want to ask you about something in your opening statement, with respect to the July 10th meeting. You testify, I participated in the July 10 meeting between National Security Advisor Bolton and then Ukrainian Chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov. As I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a generic comment about investigations. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate. The conversation did not continue, and the meeting concluded.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador Volker, we asked you about that meeting during your deposition. And you told us nothing about this. I believe we asked you about why the meeting came to an end, and why you had earlier indicated I think to Ambassador Taylor that it did not go well. And your answer was that Danilov was in the weeds on National Security policy. Why didn’t you tell us about this?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So at the time we depose you, and I think we were there for six, seven or eight hours, and we were asking you specifically about what you knew about these investigations. You didn’t remember that Gordon Sondland had brought this up in the July 10th meeting with Ukrainians, and Ambassador Bolton called an end to the meeting. Ambassador Bolton described that meeting as some drug deal that Sondland and Mulvaney cooked up. You had no recollection of that?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador Volker, you said in your written testimony today, I think all of us thought it was inappropriate. Now, if as you say, Ambassador Sondland only mentioned investigations in the Bolton meeting, and you don’t recall hearing him being more specific, although others have testified that he was in the War room. Why did you think it was inappropriate?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But Ambassador, you’ve said that you think it was appropriate to ask the Ukrainians to do investigations of 2016 and Burisma, as long as Burisma didn’t mean the Bidens. Something you have now I think, understand you should have seen otherwise. But nonetheless, if it was appropriate, why are you saying today that all of us thought it was inappropriate?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Is part of the reason it was inappropriate also that it was brought up in the context of trying to get the White House meeting?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I think you said in your updated testimony that you do think it’s inappropriate and objectionable to seek, to get a foreign government to investigate a political rival. Am I right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you recognized when you got the call record, when you finally did see the call record, that’s what took place in that call, correct?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Morrison, Ambassador Volker thinks it’s inappropriate to ask a foreign head of state to investigate a US person, let alone a political rival. But you said you had no concern with that. Do you think that’s appropriate?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, I’m not talking about a hypothetical matter. Read the transcript. In that transcript, does the President not ask Zelensky to look into the Bidens?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But nonetheless, this was the first and only time where you went from listening to a presidential call directly to the national security lawyers, is it not?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I think you’ve said that your concern was not that it was unlawful, but that it might leak. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now the problem with the leaking is that what would be leaking is a President asking a foreign head of state to investigate Mr. Biden? Isn’t that the problem?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	If it was a perfect call, would you have had a concern of it leaking?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Okay. And would you have thought it was appropriate if President Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate John Kasich, or to investigate Nancy Pelosi, or to investigate Ambassador Volker? That’d be appropriate?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But you’re not sure about Joe Biden?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Finally, my colleagues asked about, well, doesn’t aid get held up for all kinds of reasons? Ambassador Volker, have you ever seen military aid held up because a President wanted his rival investigated?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You ever seen that, Mr. Williams? Mr. Morrison, I’m sorry?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I yield to the ranking member.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Of course.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr Himes.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr Conaway.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Time of the gentleman has expired. I’d be happy to enter into the record the whistleblower statute that allows whistleblower to remain anonymous, as well as ranking member Nunes prior comments talking about the importance of anonymity for whistleblowers, and with that I recognize Ms. Sewell.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Turner.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Carson.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Dr. Wenstrup.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Speier.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You may respond.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Stewart.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Quigley.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So Ambassador, when you had this conversation and you urged Ukrainians not to investigate or prosecute the former President Poroshenko, their response was, “Oh, you mean like you’re asking us to investigate the Clintons and the Bidens?” That was their response?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you didn’t understand that at the time, but then at the time, had you read the call record?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now that you’ve read the call record, that makes a little more sense, doesn’t it?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I was curious about something you said earlier when you said that the 2016 conspiracy theory of Lutsenko had no merit, but you didn’t see any harm in Ukraine investigating it if they want to investigate it. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Don’t they have enough legitimate corruption to investigate without spending time investigating a debunk conspiracy theory?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But nonetheless, you proposed that they go ahead and do this investigation of something you thought without merit because this was part of an effort to fix the problem that Giuliani was creating?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, I think you said you were okay with it or you amended statements-
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	… as we’ve seen, to include it because, well, if it would help fix the Giuliani problem, was that the thinking?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	This was part of what you described in your opening statement as your effort to, when you see a problem, to fix it. Is it clear to now, Ambassador Volker, based on the September 25th call, that you were not able to fix it?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So it’s fair to say you were not able to fix the Giuliani problem.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Stefanik.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Swalwell.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Hurd.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Castro.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Ratcliffe.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Counsel you should use a microphone.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time for the gentleman has expired. Mr. Heck.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Welch.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Maloney?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Demings?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Ambassador Volker, just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions about Ukrainians not being aware of the aid being withheld. You’re aware, I’m sure, of the testimony of Colonel Vindman that in fact, he was contacted by someone within the Ukrainian Embassy who was concerned about the whole prior to it becoming public?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Are you aware of Ms. Croft’s testimony and transcripts that have been released that in fact, Ukrainians found out quite quickly after the hold was placed in July, that she was impressed with Ukrainian trade craft, and that the Ukrainians had a reason to keep it silent and not make it public?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You don’t have any reason to question whether in fact that testimony was accurate, do you?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So the Ukrainians did find out before it was public, at least according to these two witnesses, but nevertheless, the Ukrainians certainly found out it was public when it was published in the newspaper, right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And at the time they found out from the newspaper, they still hadn’t had the White House meeting and they still didn’t have the aid, and at that point, they had already had the conversation with the President in which he asked them to investigate the Bidens, correct?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Krishnamoorthi?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That concludes the member questioning, I now recognize ranking member for any closing comments he has.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	"I thank the gentleman, and I thank you both for your testimony today. I would highlight a couple things about what we’ve heard this afternoon. First, Ambassador Volker, your written testimony in which you say, “In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different; the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable. In retrospect,” you said, “I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections."
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador, we appreciate your willingness to amend your earlier testimony in light of what you now know. I think you’ve made it very clear that knowing what you do today, that in fact the President sought an investigation of his political rival, Vice President Biden, that you would not have countenanced any effort to encourage the Ukrainians to engage in such conduct. I appreciate also that you were able to debunk, I hope for the last time, the idea that Joe Biden did something wrong when he, in accordance with US policy, sought to replace a corrupt prosecutor, something that not only the US State Department wanted, not only the European Union wanted, and not only the IMF wanted, but was the consensus position of the United States’ national security infrastructure.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You didn’t get a lot of questions about that today as other witnesses did because I think you effectively said, “That was all nonsense.” We appreciate your candor about that. Mr. Morrison, I think what is most remarkable about your testimony is the acknowledgement that immediately after the Vice President met with President Zelensky in Warsaw, you witnessed Gordon Sondland meeting with Andrey Yermak, a top advisor to President Zelensky. And then immediately thereafter, Sondland told you that he had informed the Ukrainians that if they wanted that $400 million in military aid, they were going to have to do those investigations that the President wanted. You were later informed and this is also significant as you’ve testified here today, that the Ambassador Sondland had a subsequent conversation with President Trump and informed you that it wasn’t going to be enough for the Ukrainian Prosecutor General to announce the investigations the President wanted.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	President Zelensky had to do it himself if he wanted to get that aid, let alone the meeting in the White House. Now, you’ve been asked to opine on the meaning of the term bribery, although you weren’t asked to opine on the meaning of the terms high crimes and misdemeanors. But bribery for those watching at home is the conditioning of official acts in exchange for something of personal value. The official acts we’re talking about here are a White House meeting that President Zelensky desperately sought and as you have acknowledged Ambassador Volker, was deeply important to this country at war with Russia, to show the United States had this new president’s back. That meeting was important. That meeting is an official act. The military assistance is even more significant, because Ukrainians are dying every day in their war with Russia.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So the withholding of military assistance to get these investigations which you now have acknowledged, Ambassador Volker, was wrong for the President to request, the idea of withholding that military aid to get these political investigations should be anathema, repugnant to every American because it means the sacrifice not just of Ukrainian national security, but American national security for the interests of the President personally and politically. Now, my Republican colleagues, all they seem to be upset about with this is not that the President sought an investigation of his political rival, not that he withheld a White House meeting and $400 million in aid we all passed on a bi-partisan basis to pressure Ukraine to do those investigations. Their objection is he got caught. Their objection is that someone blew the whistle, and they would like this whistleblower identified, and the President wants this whistleblower punished. That’s their objection, not that the President engaged in this conduct but that he got caught. Their defense is, “Well, he ended up releasing the aid.” Yes, after he got caught! That doesn’t make this any less odious. Americans may be watching this and asking, “Why should the United States care about Ukraine? Why should we care about Ukraine?” And this was the import, I think of the conversation, the now infamous conversation in that Kiev restaurant with Gordon Sondland holding the phone away from his head because the President was talking so loud. What does the President ask in that call the day after the now infamous call he had with Zelensky? What does he ask on that cell phone call?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Not whether the Rada had passed some new anti-corruption reform, no. Are the Ukrainians going to do the investigation, meaning into Biden? And Sondland’s answer is, “They’re going to do it, they’ll do essentially anything the President wants.” Well, what’s more telling is the conversation, I think that Sondland has with the Foreign Service Officer Holmes afterwards, in which the President says basically, “Donald Trump doesn’t give an explitave about Ukraine.” He cares about the big things, and Mr. Holmes says, “Well, Ukraine’s at war with the Russians, that’s kind of a big thing.” And Sondland’s answer is, “No, no. He cares about big things that affect his personal interests.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	This is why Americans should care about this. And Americans should care about what happens to our allies who are dying, but America should care about their own national security and their own president and their own Constitution. And they will need to ask themselves as we will have to ask ourselves in Congress, are we prepared to accept that a President of the United States can leverage official acts, military assistance, White House meetings to get an investigation of a political rival. Are we prepared to say, “Well, I guess that’s just what we expect out of the President of the United States.” I don’t think we want to go there. I don’t think our founding fathers would have wanted us to go there.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Last week, we heard from three experienced diplomats who testified about President Trump’s scheme to condition official acts, a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars of US military aid to fight the Russians, on a deliverable by the new Ukrainian President Zelensky, two politically-moded investigations that Trump believed would help his reelection campaign. One of those investigations involved the Bidens and the other involved a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine and not Russia was responsible for interfering in our 2016 election.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	As Ambassador Sondland would later tell career Foreign Service Officer David Holmes immediately after speaking to the President, “Trump did not give a-” he then used an expletive, “about Ukraine. He cares about big stuff that benefits the President, like the Biden investigation that Giuliani was pushing.” To press a foreign leader to announce an investigation into his political rival, President Trump put his own personal and political interests above those of the nation. He undermined our military and diplomatic support for a key ally, and undercut US anticorruption efforts in Ukraine. How could our diplomats urge Ukraine to refrain from political investigations of its own citizens if the President of the United States was urging Ukraine to engage in precisely the same kind of corrupt and political investigations of one of our own citizens?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	At the White House, career professionals became concerned that President Trump, through an irregular channel that involved his acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, and Rudy Giuliani, was pushing a policy towards Ukraine at odds with the national interest. This morning we hear from two of the national security professionals who became aware of these efforts. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, whose family fled oppression in the Soviet Union when he was a toddler, is a career Army officer, an Iraq War veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart, and an expert in Russia and Ukraine who has worked at the highest levels of the Pentagon. In July 2018, he was detailed to the White House, in part to coordinate policy on Ukraine. Jennifer Williams is a career Foreign Service Officer who is currently detailed to the Office of the Vice-President and responsible for Europe and Eurasia related issues.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Following his initial and congratulatory phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky on April 21, Trump asked Vice President Pence to represent him at Zelensky’s upcoming inauguration. Ms. Williams was working on logistics for the trip. Pence would be a coveted attendee, second in significance only to the President, and it would have sent an important signal of support to the new Ukrainian President. In early May, however, Rudy Giuliani had been planning to go to Ukraine to pursue the President’s interest in having the Bidens investigated, but had to call off the trip after it became public. Among others, Giuliani blamed people around Zelensky for having to cancel, and claimed they were antagonistic to Trump. Three days later, the President called off the Vice President’s attendance at Zelensky’s inauguration. Instead, a lower level delegation was named: Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Ambassador Sondland, and Ambassador Kurt Volker, the Three Amigos. Senator Ron Johnson and Lt. Col. Vindman would also attend.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	After returning from the inauguration, several members of the delegation briefed President Trump on their encouraging first interactions with Zelensky. They urged Trump to meet with the Ukrainian President, but Trump instead criticized Ukraine and instructed them to “work with Rudy.” A few weeks later, on July 10, Ambassador Sondland met at the White House with a group of US and Ukrainian officials, including Colonel Vindman, and informed the group that according to Chief of Staff Mulvaney, the White House meeting sought by the Ukrainian President with Trump would happen if Ukraine undertook certain investigations. National Security Advisor Bolton abruptly ended the meeting and said afterwards that he would not be “part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Undeterred, Sondland brought the Ukrainian delegation downstairs to another part of the White House and was more explicit, according to witnesses. Ukraine needed to investigate the Bidens or Burisma if they were to get a White House meeting with Trump. After this discussion, which Vindman witnessed, he went to the National Security Council’s top lawyer to report the matter. Vindman was told to return in the future with any concerns. He would soon find the need to do so.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	A week later, on July 18, a representative of the Office of Management and Budget announced on a video conference call that Mulvaney, at Trump’s direction, was freezing nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine which was appropriated by Congress and enjoyed the support of the entirety of the US national security establishment. And one week after that, Trump would have the now infamous July 25 phone call with Zelensky. During that call, Trump complained that the U.S. relationship with Ukraine had not been “reciprocal.” Later, Zelensky thanks Trump for his support “in the area of defense,” and says that Ukraine was ready to purchase more Javelins, an antitank weapon that was among the most important deterrents of further Russian military action. Trump’s immediate response: “I would like you to do us a favor, though.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Trump then requested that Zelensky investigate the discredited 2016 conspiracy theory, and even more ominously, look into the Bidens. Neither was part of the official preparatory material for the call, but they were in Donald Trump’s personal interest, and in the interests of his 2020 re-election campaign. And the Ukrainian President knew about both in advance, because Sondland and others had been pressing Ukraine for weeks about investigations into the 2016 election, Burisma and the Bidens.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Both Col. Vindman and Ms. Williams were on the July 25 call. Vindman testified that due to the unequal bargaining position of the two leaders and Ukraine’s dependency on the US, the favor Trump asked of Zelensky was really a demand. After the call, multiple individuals, including Vindman, were concerned enough to report it to the National Security Council’s top lawyer. It was the second time in two weeks that Vindman had raised concerns with the NSC lawyers. For her part, Williams also believed that asking Zelensky to undertake these political investigations was inappropriate, and that it might explain something else she had become aware of, the otherwise inexplicable hold on US military assistance to Ukraine .
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Both Col. Vindman and Ms. Williams also took note of the explicit use of the word Burisma by Zelensky, a fact conspicuously left out of the record of the call, now locked away on an ultra-secure server. Col. Vindman believed that Zelensky must have been prepped for the call to be able to make the connection between Biden and Burisma, a fact that other witnesses have now confirmed.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In the weeks that followed the July 25 call, Col. Vindman continued to push for a release of the military aid to Ukraine, and struggled to learn why it was being withheld. More disturbing, word of the hold had reached Ukrainian officials prior to it becoming public. By mid-August, the Ukrainian Deputy Ambassador asked Vindman why the United States was withholding the aid. Although Vindman didn’t have an answer, Sondland made it explicit to the Ukrainians at a meeting in Warsaw: They needed to publicly commit to these two investigations if they hoped to get the aid.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Williams, we all saw the President’s tweet about you on Sunday afternoon and the insults he hurled at Ambassador Yovanovich last Friday. You are here today, and the American people are grateful. Col. Vindman, we have seen far more scurrilous attacks on your character, and watched as certain personalities on Fox have questioned your loyalty. I note that you have shed blood for America, and we owe you an immense debt of gratitude. I hope no one on this committee will become part of those vicious attacks.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Today’s witnesses, like those who testified last week, are here because they were subpoenaed to appear, not because they are for or against impeachment. That question is for Congress, not the fact witnesses. If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts, a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid, it will be up to us to decide whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I now recognize ranking member Nunes for any remarks he’d like to make.     Devin Nunes Opening Statement
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Before we get into the substance of your testimony. Ms. Williams, I want to ask you about a phone call between Vice President Pence and President Zelensky of Ukraine on September 18th were you on that call?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And did you take notes of the call?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Is there something about that call that you think may be relevant to our investigation?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Sir, could you move the microphone a little closer to …
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you, counsel. Ms. Williams, I only ask you in this setting whether you think there’s something relevant to our inquiry in that call and whether if so you’ll be willing to make a classified submission to the committee.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	It may not be necessary for you to appear if you’ll be willing to submit the information in writing to the committee.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank you. Colonel Vindman, if I could turn your attention to the April 21st call. That is the first call between President Trump and President Zelensky. Did you prepare talking points for the president to use during that call?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And did those talking points include rooting out corruption in Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That was something the president was supposed to raise in the conversation with President Zelensky?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Did you listen in on that call?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The White House has now released the record of that call. Did President Trump ever mention corruption in the April 21st call?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	On the April 21st call, President Trump told President Zelensky that he would send a high level US delegation to the inauguration. Following that call, Ms. Williams was it your understanding that the president wanted the vice president to attend inauguration in Keiv?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And did the president subsequently tell the vice president not to attend the inauguration?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And am I correct that you learned this on May 13th, is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Am I also correct that the inauguration date had not been set by May 13th?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Do you know what accounted for the president’s decision to instruct the vice president not to attend?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Colonel Vindman, you were a member of the US delegation to the inauguration on May 20th, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And during that trip, did you have an opportunity to offer any advice to President Zelensky?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	What was the advice that you gave him?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Do you mean politics?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Why did you feel it was necessary to advise President Zelensky to stay away from US domestic politics?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I know Mr. Goldman will have more questions about that when I turn to him, but let me turn if I can to the hold on security assistance, which I think you both testified you learned about in early July. Am I correct that neither of you were provided with a reason for why the president put a hold on security assistance to Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And Colonel Vindman?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Colonel Vindman, you attended a meeting in John Bolton’s office on July 10th where Ambassador Sondland interjected to respond to a question by senior Ukrainian officials about a White House visit. What did he say at that time?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And what was Ambassador Bolton’s response or reaction to that comment?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Did you report this incident to the national security council lawyers?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Based on Ambassador Sondland’s remark at the July 10th meeting, was it your clear understanding that the Ukrainians understood they had to commit to investigations President Trump wanted in order to get the White House meeting?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But the import of what Ambassador Sondland said during that meeting was that there was an agreement with Mick Mulvaney that Zelensky would get the meeting if they would undertake these investigations?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	About two weeks after that July 10th meeting, President Trump and President Zelensky had their second call. The now infamous July 25th call. Colonel Vindman, What was your real time reaction to hearing that call?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And what was your concern?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Colonel, you’ve described this as a demand, this favor that the president asked. What is it about the relationship between the president of the United States and the president of Ukraine that leads you to conclude that when the president of the United States asks a favor like this, it’s really a demand?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Williams, I think you described your reaction in your deposition when you listened to the call as you found it unusual and inappropriate, but I was struck by something else you said in your deposition. You said that it shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold. What did you mean by that?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But it raised the question in your mind as to whether the two were related?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Both of you recall President Zelensky in that conversation raising the issue or mentioning Burisma, do you not?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And yet the word Burisma appears nowhere in the call record that’s been released to the public. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Do you know why that’s the case, why that was left out?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Colonel, you pointed out the fact that that word was used, did you not?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And the edit was not included in the record released to the public?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I think Colonel, you testified in your deposition that you found it striking that Zelensky would bring up Burisma. That it indicated to you that he had been prepped for the call to expect this issue to come up. What led you to that conclusion?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	If I could interject here, we don’t want to use these proceedings.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I know, but we need to protect the whistleblower. [crosstalk 00:10:37]
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I want to make sure that there’s no effort to out the whistleblower through the use of these proceedings. If the witness has a good faith belief that this may reveal the identity of the whistleblower, that is not the purpose that we are here for and I want to advise the witness accordingly.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	If I could interject. Counsel is correct. Whistleblower has the right, statutory right to anonymity. These proceedings will not be used to out the whistleblower. [inaudible 00:13:05]
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Want to ask you both about some of the questions you were asked by my colleagues in the minority. First, if I could ask you, Ms. Williams and Colonel Vindman, you were asked a series of questions by the ranking member at the outset. Were you aware of the fact that, and then there was a recitation of information about [inaudible 00:00:20], the Bidens. Is it fair to say you have no firsthand knowledge of any of the matters that we’re asking those questions?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Williams, you were also asked a series of questions about the vice president’s schedule and whether he could have made the inauguration or was the president traveling or the trip to Canada. Let’s be clear about something. The president, you were instructed that the president had told the vice president not to go before you even knew the date of the inauguration. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So at the time he was told not to go, there was no calculation about where he might be or where the president might be because the date hadn’t even been set yet. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now I think you said that originally the president had told him to go and then you received the instruction that the president no longer wanted him to go. Were you aware in the interim between the president telling him to go and the president telling him not to go, that Rudy Giuliani had to abort a trip that he was going to make to Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And had you seen in the press that Rudy Giuliani blamed people around Zelensky for having to cancel the trip?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Yes.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And did you read the press reporting also that Giuliani wanted to go to Ukraine to, as he put it, “Not meddle in an election, but meddle in investigations?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And that occurred prior to the president canceling the vice president’s trip to the inauguration?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Colonel Vindman, you were asked by the minority council about the president’s words on the July 25th call and whether the president’s words were ambiguous. Was there any ambiguity about the president’s use of the word Biden?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	It was pretty clear that the president wanted Zelensky to commit to investigating the Bidens, was it not?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That is one of the favors that you thought should be properly characterized as a demand?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And there’s no ambiguity about that?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	It’s also true, is it not, that these two investigations that the president asked Zelensky for into 2016 and into the Bidens were precisely the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani was calling for publicly, were they not?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So when people suggest, well, maybe Rudy Giuliani was acting on his own and maybe he was a freelancer or whatever, the president referred to exactly the same two investigations Rudy Giuliani was out pushing on his behalf. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now, Ms. Williams, you were asked about the meeting. The vice president had with Zelensky in September in which the Ukrainians brought up their concern about the hold on the security assistance. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you were asked about whether in that meeting between the Vice President Zelensky, the Bidens or Burisma came up and I think you said they did not. Correct?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now that bilateral meeting was a large meeting that involved two or three dozen people, wasn’t it?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So in the context of this meeting with two or three dozen people, the vice president didn’t bring up those investigations, correct?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Were you aware that immediately, and I mean immediately after that meeting broke up, Ambassador Sondland has said that he went over to Mr. Yermak, one of the top advisors to Zelensky and told Yermak that if they wanted the military aid, they were going to have to do these investigations or words to that effect?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So at the big public meeting it didn’t come up. And you can’t speak to the private meeting that was held immediately thereafter?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now Colonel Vindman, I want to go back to that July 10th meeting or meetings, the one with Ambassador Bolton and then the one in the wardroom that followed quickly on its heels. Were you aware that Ambassador Bolton instructed your superior Dr. Hill to go talk to the lawyers after that meeting?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now you thought you should go talk to the lawyers on your own, correct?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But Bolton also thought that Dr. Hill should go talk to the lawyers because of his concern over this drug deal that Sondland and Mulvaney were cooking up. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And in fact, this drug deal, as Bolton called it, involved this conditioning of the White House meeting on these investigations that Sondland brought up. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And in fact, this same conditioning or this same issue of wanting these political investigations and tying it to the White House meeting, this came up in the July 25th call, did it not? When the president asked for these investigations?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So the very same issue that Bolton said to Hill, “Go talk to the lawyers,” the very same issue that prompted you to go talk to the lawyers ends up coming up in that call with the president. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And it was that conversation that once again led you back to the lawyer’s office?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now yield to the ranking member.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Colonel Vindman, what was your realtime reaction to hearing that call?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And what was your concern?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now, Colonel, you’ve described this as a demand, this favor that the president asked. What is it about the relationship between the President of the United States and the President of Ukraine that leads you to conclude that when the President of the United States asks a favor like this, it’s really a demand?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ms. Williams, I think you described your reaction in your deposition as, when you listened to the call, as you found it unusual and inappropriate. But I was struck by something else you said in your deposition. You said that, “It shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold.” What did you mean by that?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Both of you recall President Zelensky in that conversation, raising the issue or mentioning Burisma. Do you not?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And yet the word Burisma appears nowhere in the call record that’s been released to the public. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Do you know why that’s the case? Why that was left out?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But Colonel, you pointed out the fact that that word was used, did you not?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And the edit was not included in the record released to the public?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I think Colonel, you testified in your deposition that you found it striking that Zelensky would bring up Burisma. That it indicated to you that he had been prepped for the call, to expect this issue to come up. What led you to that conclusion?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	If I could interject here, we don’t want to use these proceedings-
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I know, but we need to protect the whistle blower. If-
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Please stop.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I want to make sure that there’s no effort to out the whistleblower through the use of these proceedings. If the witness has a good faith belief that this may reveal the identity of the whistleblower, that is not the purpose that we are here for and I want to advise the witness accordingly.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	If I could interject. Counsel is correct. Whistleblower has the right, statutory right to anonymity. These proceedings will not be used to out the whistleblower.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentleman for yielding. I wanted to just make one point clear for folks that are watching the hearing today, bribery does involve a quid pro quo. Bribery involves the conditioning of an official act for something of value. An official act may be a White House meeting. An official act may be 400 million in military aid and something of value to a president might include investigations of their political rival.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The reason we don’t ask witnesses that are fact witnesses to make the judgment about whether a crime or bribery has been committed or whether more significantly the … what the founders had in mind when they itemize bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors is your fact witnesses. It will be our job to decide whether the impeachable act of bribery has occurred. That’s why we don’t ask you those questions. For one thing, you’re also not aware of all the other facts that had been adduced during the investigation. With that, I yield back to Mr. Carson.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The gentleman will suspend. Counsel?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you, Counsel. As I indicated before, this committee will not be used to out the whistleblower. That same necessity to protect the whistleblower will persist.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You are recognized again, Mr. Jordan.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr. Jordan, this is your time for questioning. You can use it any way you like, but your question should be addressed to the witness.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And your question should not be addressed to trying to out the whistleblower.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I want to thank our witnesses today, Ms. Williams, Colonel Vindman, both of you for your service to the country for your testimony here today, and I just want to address briefly some of the evidence you presented as well as others thus far in the impeachment inquiry. First of all, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you, Colonel Vindman for your military service, and I should tell you that not withstanding all of the questions you got on, why didn’t you go talk to your supervisor? Why didn’t you go talk to Mr. Morrison? Why did you go to the national security lawyer? As if there’s something wrong with going to the national security lawyer? Are you aware that we asked Mr. Morrison whether he went to the national security lawyer right after the call, and that he did?
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And are you aware also that we asked him, well, if you had this problem with Colonel Vindman not going to you instead of the lawyer, naturally you must’ve gone to your supervisor. And you know what his answer was? He didn’t go to his supervisor either. He went directly to the national security council lawyers. I hope my colleagues will give him the same hard time for not following his chain of command that he complained about with you apparently. The president may attack you and has, others on Right-Wing TV might attack you, and they have, but I thought you should know and maybe you know already that this is what the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had to say about you Colonel Vindman, “He is a professional, competent, patriotic, and loyal officer. He has made an extraordinary contribution to the security of our nation in both peacetime and combat.” I’m sure your dad is proud to hear that.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	My colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we’ve heard it before, that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. That’s our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there’s no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. The evidence all points in the other direction, the evidence points in the direction of the president inviting Ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a US political opponent.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Ambassador Yovanavitch was known as a strong fighter of corruption. So what does the president do? He recalls her from her post. Ambassador Yovanovich in fact was at a meeting celebrating other anticorruption fighters, including a woman who had acid thrown in her face on the day she was told to get on the next plane back to Washington. You prepare talking points for the president’s first conversation with Zelinsky. He supposed to talk about rooting up corruption. If this president had such a deep interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, surely he would have brought it up on the call. But of course, we now know that he did not.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We then see Rudy Giuliani not fighting corruption, but asking for an investigation of the Bidens. And my colleagues say, “Well, maybe he was acting on his own,” even though he says he’s acting as the president’s lawyer. Maybe he was really acting on his own. But the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani wanted, come up in the meeting you participate in on July 10th at the white house when a Ambassador Sonnen brings up the Bidens and Brisbois and 2016. Tells the Ukrainians who want that meeting, the white house, you’ve got to do these investigations. Now they would say ambassadors Sonnen was acting on his own, but that doesn’t quite work either because we have the call record from July 25th, which the president was forced to release in which the president doesn’t bring up corruption. He doesn’t say, “How are those anti-corruption cords going?” Or “Great work in the RADA.” Of course not.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	What does the president’s say? I want you to investigate the Bidens and this debunk conspiracy theory pushed by Vladimir Putin, that also helps me in my reelection. So much for fighting corruption. The message to Ukraine, the real message to Ukraine, our US policy message is, don’t engage in political investigations. The message from the president, however, was the exact opposite. Do engage in political investigations and do it for my reelection. And it’s also made clear if they want the white house meeting and ultimately if they want 400 million in USAID, this is what they have to do.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The only lament I hear from my colleagues is, it wasn’t successful. They got caught. They didn’t get the political infestations and they still had to release the money. Now, they still haven’t gotten the white house meeting, but they had to release the money because a whistleblower blew the whistle. Whistleblower the president wants to punish and because Congress announced it was doing investigations and very soon thereafter, the president was forced to lift the hold on the aid. They argue, well, this makes it okay. That it was a failed effort to bribe Ukraine, a failed effort to extort Ukraine. That doesn’t make it better. It’s no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And we have courageous people like yourself who come forward, who report things, who do what they should do, who have a sense as you put it, Colonel, of duty, of duty, not to the person of the president, but to the presidency and to the country. And we thank you for that.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	At the end of the day, I think this all comes back to something we heard from another career foreign service officer just last Friday. In a conversation he overheard with the president in a restaurant in Ukraine, in which the president, not Rudy Giuliani, not anyone else, the president of the United States wanted to know are they going to do the investigations? This is the day after that July 25th call. Are they going to do the investigations and he’s insured by ambassador Sonnen, that they’re going to do it. And what does Sonnen relate to this foreign service officer after he hangs up that call? The president doesn’t give a expletive about Ukraine. He only cares about the big things that help his personal interests.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	That’s all you need to know. And it isn’t just about Ukraine. Of course, Ukraine is fighting our fight against the Russians, against their expansionism. That’s our fight too. That’s our fight too, at least we thought so on a bipartisan basis. That’s our fight too. That’s why we support Ukraine with a military aid that we have.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, the president may not care about it, but we do. We care about our defense. We care about the defense of our allies and we darn well care about our constitution.
0201-11-19	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	We are adjourned.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess so the committee, at any time, there is a quorum present.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Here’s how the committee will proceed for this hearing. I will make an opening statement, and then ranking member Nunes will have the opportunity to make a statement. And we will go to witness statements and then to questions.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	For audience members, we welcome you and we respect your interest in being here. In turn, we ask for your respect as we proceed with today’s hearing.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	It is the intention of the committee to proceed without disruptions.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	What purpose?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Gentleman will state the inquiry.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I have not. As we informed the minority yesterday, we will see how the first period goes and how much material we are able to get through. At that point, the chair will announce the period, if there is a period of the second round, which may be up to 45 minutes. Or we’ll go straight to a five minute questions by members.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	For audience members, again, we welcome you and your interest. In turn, we expect and will insist on decorum in the committee. As chairman, I’ll take all necessary and appropriate steps to maintain order and ensure the committee is run in accordance with House rules and House Resolution 660.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In 2014, Russia invaded the United States ally, Ukraine, to reverse that nation’s embrace of the West and to fulfill Vladimir Putin’s desire to rebuild a Russian empire. In the following years, 14,000 Ukrainians died as they battled superior Russian forces.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Earlier this year, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine on a platform of ending the conflict and tackling corruption. He was a newcomer to politics and immediately sought to establish a relationship with Ukraine’s most powerful patron, the United States.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether president Trump sought to exploit that ally’s vulnerability and invite Ukraine’s interference in our elections. Whether President Trump sought conditioned official acts, such as a White House meeting or US military assistance on Ukraine’s willingness to assist with two political investigations that would help his reelection campaign. And if President Trump did either, whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the presidency.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The matter is as simple and as terrible as that. Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency, but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their Commander in Chief.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	There are a few actions as consequential as the impeachment of a president. While the Founders did not intend that impeachment be employed for mere differences over policy, they also made impeachment a constitutional process that the Congress must utilize as necessary.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The facts in the present inquiry are not seriously contested. Beginning in January of this year, the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, pressed Ukrainian authorities to investigate Burisma, the country’s largest national gas producer, and the Bidens, since Vice President Joe Biden was seen as a strong potential challenger to Trump.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Giuliani also promoted a debunked conspiracy that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the 2016 US election. The nation’s intelligence agencies have stated unequivocally that it was Russia, not Ukraine, that interfered in our election. But Giuliani believed this conspiracy theory referred to as Crowdstrike, shorthand for the company that discovered the Russian hack, would aid his client’s reelection.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Giuliani also conducted a smear campaign against the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. On April 29, a senior state department official told her that although she had done nothing wrong, President Trump had lost confidence in her. With the sidelining of Yovanovitch, the stage was set for the establishment of an irregular channel in which Giuliani and later others. Including Gordon Sondland, an influential donor to the President’s inauguration, now serving as ambassador to the European Union could advance the President’s personal and political interests.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Yovanovitch’s replacement in Kiev, Ambassador Bill Taylor, is a West Point graduate and a Vietnam veteran. As he began to better understand the scheme through the summer of 2019, he pushed back, informing Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent and others about a plan to condition US government actions and funding on the performance of political favors by the Ukrainian government. Favors intended for President Trump that would undermine our security and our elections.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Several key events in this scheme took place in the month of July. On July 10th, Ambassador Sondland informed a group of US and Ukrainian officials meeting at the White House that according to you, Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian president with Trump would happened if Ukraine undertook an investigation into the energy sector, which was understood to mean Burisma and specifically, the Bidens. National Security Advisor Bolton abruptly ended the meeting and said afterwards that he would not be quote, “Part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this,” end quote.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	A week later on July 18th, representative of the Office of Management and Budget, the White House agency that oversees federal spending, announced on a video conference that Mulvaney, at the direction of the President, was freezing nearly $400 million in security assistance authorized and appropriated by Congress, in which the entirety of the US national security establishment supported. One week after that, Donald Trump would have the now infamous July 25th phone call with Ukrainian president, Zelensky.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	During that call, Trump complained that the US relationship with Ukraine had not been reciprocal. Later, Zelensky thanks Trump for his support in the area of defense and says that Ukraine is ready to purchase more Javelins, an anti-tank weapon that was among the most important deterrence of further Russian military action. Trump’s immediate response, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” Trump then requested that Zelensky investigate the discredited 2016 Crowdstrike conspiracy theory and even more ominously, look into the Bidens.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Neither of these investigations was in the US national interest. And neither was part of the official preparatory material for the call. Both however, were in Donald Trump’s personal interest and in the interests of his 2020 reelection campaign. And the Ukrainian president knew about both in advance because Sondland and others had been pressing Ukraine for weeks about investigations into the 2016 election, Burisma, and the Bidens.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	After the call, multiple individuals were concerned enough to report it to the National Security Council’s top lawyer. The White House would then take the extraordinary step of moving the call record to a highly classified server, exclusively reserved for the most sensitive intelligence matters.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In the weeks that followed, Ambassador Taylor learned new facts about a scheme that Sondland, even Sondland would describe as becoming more insidious. Taylor texted Sondland quote, “Are we now saying that security assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	As summer turned to fall, “it kept getting more insidious,” Mr. Sondland testified. Mr. Taylor, who took notes of his conversations, said the ambassador told him in a September 1st phone call that everything was dependent on the public announcement of investigations including security assistance. President Trump wanted Mr. Zelensky in a public box.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	“President Trump is a businessman,” Sondland said later. “When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	In a sworn declaration after Taylor’s testimony, Sondland would admit to telling Ukrainians at a September 1st meeting in Warsaw quote, “That resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we have been discussing for many weeks.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The President’s chief of staff confirmed Trump’s efforts to coerce Ukraine by withholding aid. When Mick Mulvaney was asked publicly about it, his answer was breathtaking. “We do that all the time with foreign policy,” he said, “I have news for everybody. Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy. That is going to happen.” The video of that confession is plain for all to see.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Some have argued in the President’s defense that the aid was ultimately released. That is true. But only after Congress began an investigation. Only after the President’s lawyers learned of a whistleblower complaint. And only after members of Congress began asking uncomfortable questions about quid pro quos.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	A scheme to condition official acts or taxpayer funding to obtain a personal political benefit does not become less odious because it is discovered before it is fully consummated. In fact, the security assistance had been delayed so long, it would take another act of Congress to ensure that it could still go out. And that Oval Office meeting that Zelensky desperately sought, it still hasn’t happened.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Although we have learned a great deal about these events in the last several weeks, there are still missing pieces. The President has instructed the State Department and other agencies to ignore congressional subpoenas for documents. He has instructed witnesses to defy subpoenas and refuse to appear. And he has suggested that those who do expose wrongdoing should be treated like traitors and spies.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	These actions will force Congress to consider, as it did with President Nixon, whether Trump’s obstruction of the constitutional duties of Congress constituted additional grounds for impeachment. If the President can simply refuse all oversight, particularly in the context of an impeachment proceeding, the balance of power between our two branches of government will be irrevocably altered. That is not what the Founders intended. And the prospects for further corruption and abuse of power, in this administration or any other, will be exponentially increased.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	This is what we believe the testimony will show, both as to the President’s conduct and as to his obstruction of Congress. The issue that we confront is the one posed by the President’s acting Chief of Staff when he challenged Americans to “get over it.” If we find that the President of the United States abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, or if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts, a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid, must we simply “get over it”?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Is this what Americans should now expect from their president? If this is not impeachable conduct, what is? Does the oath of office itself, requiring that our laws be faithfully executed, that our president defend a constitution that balances the powers of its branches, setting ambition against ambition so we become no monarchy, still have meaning?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	These are the questions we must ask and answer. Without rancor if we can, without delay regardless, and without party favor and without prejudice if we are true to our responsibilities. Benjamin Franklin was asked what kind of a country America was to become. “A Republic, he answered, “if you can keep it.” The fundamental issue raised by the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump is, “Can we keep it?”  Devin Nunes Opening Statement
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	[crosstalk 00:00:00] Ambassador Taylor, I’d like to begin by following up on something that you have disclosed today, and you disclosed earlier to both majority and minority, but it is some new information for the committee. You said in your testimony that one of your staff was present with Ambassador Sondland on the day after the July 25th phone call. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And as your staff related the event to you, your staff member could overhear Mr. Sondland on the phone … well, could overhear the President on the phone with Mr. Sondland, is that right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So the President must’ve been speaking loud enough on the phone … this was a cellphone, I take it?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The President must’ve been speaking loud enough for your staff member to be able to overhear this?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And what your staff member could overhear was President Trump asking Ambassador Sondland about, “The investigations.” Is that right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I think you testified also that you had come to understand that the term investigations was a term that Ambassador Sondland, as well as Volker used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to the investigations of Burisma and the Bidens. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So your staff member overhears the President asking about the investigations, meaning Burisma and the Bidens in 2016, and Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I think you said that after the call when your staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought of Ukraine, his response was that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I take it the end part of that is he cares more about that than he does about Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	During your testimony, Ambassador Taylor, you also said that more Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without US assistance. Why is that?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I take it if the provision of US military assistance would save Ukrainian lives, lives that any delay in that assistance may also cost Ukrainian lives. Is that true?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I think you said that a Ukrainian soldier lost their life while you were visiting Donbass.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And indeed Ukrainians lose their lives every week?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I think you also testified that Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian government. Why is that significant?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And so when the Ukrainians learned of the suspension of the military aid, either privately or when others learned publicly, the Russians would be learning also and they would take that as a lack of robust US support for Ukraine. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And that would weaken Ukraine in negotiating an end to the war in Donbass?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	People watching I’m sure are interested in how military assistance and diplomatic support for Ukraine effects Ukraine, but even more so interested in how does this effect our national security. Now, I think you said that if we believe in a principle of sovereignty of nations where countries get to determine their own economic political and security alliances, we have to support Ukraine and its fight, that the kind of aggression we see by Russia can’t stand. How is it important to American national security that we provide for a robust defense of Ukraine sovereign?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I want to thank you both for your decades of service to the country and I’ll now recognize Mr. Goldman for questioning.  Devin Nunes Questioning Bill Taylor
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I will now move to five minute member rounds. I recognize myself for five minutes. Mr. Kent, I want to follow up on my colleague’s questions regarding Burisma. You testified about a time when an oligarch named Zlochevsky, I think it was, was self-dealing awarding himself contracts. When was that?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So this corrupt self-dealing then was approximately seven years, at least seven years before the events that bring us here today, the phone call on the 25th and the events around it?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And you’ve read the call transcript, have you not?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Is there any mention in the discussion with President Trump and President Zelensky of this oligarch, Zlochevsky, who seven years earlier had been self-dealing?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Is there a discussion of awarding contracts to oneself or the corrupt acts in the 2012 to 2014 timeframe?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	What the President brings up is CrowdStrike, the server, and the Bidens? Am I right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	There was no discussion on that call of setting up an anti-corruption court or looking into corruption among oligarchs or companies in general. The President’s comments were focused on two things, 2016 and the Bidens, am I right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now, you testified in your opening statement, “I do not believe the United States should ask other countries to engage in selective politically associated investigations or prosecutions against the opponents of those in power. Because such selective actions undermine the rule of law regardless of the country.” The selective politically associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power are you referring to the Bidens, there?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But that would apply to the President of United States seeking an investigation of his political opponent, would it not?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I take it in your discussions, Ambassador Taylor, with Ambassador Sondland or others, what was communicated to you was that the President wanted investigations into 2016 and the Bidens, not into an oligarch named Zlochevsky or self-dealing, but 2016 and the Bidens, was that your understanding?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And in fact, when you said your staff overheard this call between Ambassador Sondland and the President, in that call, the President brings up investigation, does he not?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And immediately after the President gets off the phone with Sondland, Sondland is asked by your staff, “What does the President think about Ukraine?” And his answer is, “He’s just interested in the Bidens.” Am I right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	More interested in the Bidens. No discussion of Zlochevsky or Chalupa or things that happened seven years ago. He was interested in the Bidens?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Now I think you also testified that Ambassador Sondland told you that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And by public box did that mean that private statements, private promises to do this investigation of 2016 or the Bidens were not enough, he had to go on T.V., he had to go public in some way because the President wanted him in that box. Is that your understanding?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I think you said in that same call you asked Ambassador Sondland to push back on President Trump’s demand, is that right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So you understood from your conversation with Sondland, this was the President’s demand, not Sondland’s demand, the President’s demand, and you wanted Sondland to push back, am I right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Well, and I think the way you expressed yourself is, you wanted Sondland to push back on President Trump’s demand, right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So it was your understand from talking to Sondland, this is what the President wanted him to do and you wanted Sondland to push back?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And in fact, even after the aide was ultimately released, even after the White House learns of the whistleblower complaint and the congressional investigation, the aid is released. Even after those events, you are still worried that Zelensky was going to feel it necessary to go on CNN and announce these investigations, were you not?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And I think you said earlier that Danylyuk, the national security advisor then for Zelensky, was concerned Zelensky didn’t want to be used as some tool in American politics, is that right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	So Zelenksy didn’t want to go on T.V. to announce political investigations that he thought would mire him in U.S. politics, right?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	But nonetheless, it appeared until the aid was lifted, the hold was lifted, that he felt compelled to do it.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Even though he didn’t want to be mired in U.S. politics?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I’ll allow the question, but-
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I’ve will allow the question. I won’t dock this from the time. I just want to be clear Ambassador, if you’re able to verify the things that council has asked you in the prerequisite of the question, that’s fine. Otherwise, in questions from the majority or the minority, that may assume facts not in evidence before you, you should be cautioned about that.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time is with minority council. Mr. Ratcliffe.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	As I said, Mr. Ratcliffe, I will allow the question.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Does the ranking member seek recognition?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	For what purpose to seek recognition?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I have answered it. You may resume your question.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Mr Ratcliffe. I’ll say once again, I’m not objecting to the question, but I am instructing the witness that they should not presume questions, from the majority or the minority, that may represent facts not in evidence, are correct. I have answered your question. We will resume the questioning and resume the clock. Mr. Castor.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman’s expired. Ambassador Taylor, would you like to respond?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Please don’t interrupt the witness.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Thank you, Ambassador Taylor.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	Time of the gentleman has expired. Ambassador Taylor, did you want to finish your answer?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I now recognize Mr. Carson for five minutes.
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just want to follow up on some of the earlier questions about Ambassador, sorry about President Zolinsky’s statements after the scandal came to light. When he was asked were you pressured, how’d the phone call go, et cetera. Ukrainians, Mr. Kent, are pretty sophisticated about US politics, are they not?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	You would agree that if President Zolinsky contradicted President Trump and said, “Of course I felt pressured. They were holding up 400 million in military assistance. We have people dying every day.” If he were to contradict President Trump directly, they would be sophisticated enough to know they may pay a very heavy price with this president, were they not?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And President Zolinsky not only had to worry about retribution from Donald Trump, should he contradict Donald Trump publicly, he also has to worry about how he’s perceived domestically, doesn’t he, ambassador Taylor?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	And so if President Zolinsky were to say, “I had to capitulate and agree to these investigations, I was ready to go on CNN until the aid got restored.” That would obviously be hurtful to him back home, would it not?
2019-11-13	Adam Schiff	D-Schiff	Democrat	The time of the gentleman has expired.  Representative Questioning
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Mr. Holmes-
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	? much has been made about the use of both regular and irregular foreign service or diplomatic channels. My reading of history is that American presidents have, on occasion, used irregular channels. Would you generally agree?
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And my reading of history is that generally speaking, however, those irregular channels have either been closely coordinated with the regular ones, or at least in furtherance of American foreign policy and our national security interest. Would you agree?
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And do you believe, sir, that Mr. Giuliani?s efforts were closely coordinated with the regular channels such as the ambassador to the Ukraine?
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And were they in furtherance of the American foreign policy as you understood it?
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Mr. Holmes, if left unchecked, do you think that Russia would either by means of force or other malign means subjugate Ukraine, attempt to render it a client state, if not occupy it?
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	You know, I feel like I?ve been treated to a Gatling gun fire of myth propagation over the last couple of weeks and it reminds me of that old expression about the big lie. If you tell it often enough and keep repeating it, that people will come to believe it. And I think we?ve been subjected to some of that.
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Here?s a sample. The president didn?t solicit campaign assistance from Ukraine in a clear violation of federal law. Yes, he did. The president didn?t withhold vital military assistance in furtherance of his objective to obtain that campaign assistance. Yes, he did. Rudy Giuliani was acting just on his own, kind of as a rogue. No, he wasn?t. That all this is business as usual, this happens all the time and stems from a principled interest. No, it isn?t and no, it wasn?t. And that it?s okay to attack patriotic diplomats in public service if they stand in your way and have the courage to speak up. And no, it isn?t.
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Those are just some of the big lies, but here?s the big truth. The president did it. He did it. We all just came from the floor, and it?s a majestic chamber. In the front of the chamber there are only two portraits. On the left, looking forward, is my favorite president, George Washington. And on the right is the Marquis de Lafayette, who came to this country to help us stand up our fledgling democracy.
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	So here?s another big truth. Without his help, we probably never would?ve gotten off the ground. And that assistance from many other countries who were helping us to create something that had never been created before. It was an audacious idea. This notion of a democracy, of self-governance, of freedoms such as speech and press and religion and expression and assembly, and most of all, that it would be rooted in the premise of the rule of law. Not monarchs, not military strong men, but the rule of law. Others helped us to get here and we wouldn?t be here without them. And I frankly feel like we?re almost in a little bit of a pay-it-forward moment.
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	So when the president did it, he put at risk the security of Ukraine, a strategic ally, and a nascent democracy with their masses yearning to breathe free. Who six years ago this day, when their government said, ?We?re not going to sign that Memorandum of Agreement with European Union? rose up and took to the streets, because they wanted, frankly, what we have.
2019-11-21	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And when the president did it, he put our own national security at risk. But what he did, most importantly, was put at risk that idea that makes us exceptional, because I do believe America?s truly exceptional. We are a country rooted in something that nobody has ever tried before. Rule of law. He put that at risk when he did what he did. The president did it. And the only question that remains is, what will we do? I yield back Mr. Chairman.
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Ambassador, I’d like to thank you very much. Add my voice of gratitude for your years of service. Frankly, you’re the best of this nation and I cannot think of anybody else I would rather have representing us in a foreign capitol than you.
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	My colleagues have gone to a great deal of effort to better understand the facts surrounding your removal. I think the facts are pretty clear. There was a smear campaign, and it was orchestrated by a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor, the President’s attorney, the President’s son, and even some of the President’s allies at his favorite TV station.
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	So, that campaign led to your removal despite 33 years of outstanding service, progressive responsibility, and awards. And so I kind of sit here with a mix of emotions. On the one hand, there’s some pride and gratitude for all your outstanding service, and on the other hand I’m angry, like my friend from Connecticut. In fact, I’m very angry about how it is the most powerful person on the face of the earth would remove you from office after your stellar service, and somehow feel compelled to characterize you as bad news, and then to ominously threaten that you’re going to go through some things.
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	So I am angry, but I’m not surprised. After all, as was suggested earlier, he said the whistleblower may have committed treason, a crime punishable by death, even though the whistle blower strictly adhered to the letter of the law as independently attested to by both the Trump appointed Inspector General and the acting DNI.
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	After all, he even demeaned the memory of Senator McCain after he lied at his grave at the Naval Academy grounds, despite a lifetime of public service, and serving six years as a prisoner of war in a tiny cell in Hanoi being beaten and tortured every day.
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And after all, he belittled the Gold Star Khan family who’s son Captain Kahn gave his last full measure of devotion out of love for this country. And let me tell you, as somebody who’s older brother never saw his 35th birthday because of service in the Vietnam War, those words are deeply offensive. Words matter, and the words leveled against you constitute bullying of the worst order. Your good character, your outstanding reputation, have been besmirched in a way that is devoid of common decency. But here’s my message to you. There is nothing Ambassador Yovanovitch, nothing he can say or do, not a thing that will in any way diminish the nature and quality of the service you have rendered to our great nation. Not a thing. And there is not a thing he can say or do that will diminish our gratitude to you for that service, and I thank you again for it.
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	So as to the larger point, I would like you to answer what does this mean to Ukraine when the United States actually engages in the kind of behavior that we are attempting to discourage them from engaging in, namely a politically motivated prosecution? What does that mean to them in their struggling efforts to become a robust democracy? What’s the impact in Ukraine for this behavior?
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Thank you, Ambassador Yovanovitch. Thank you so very much.
0201-11-15	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	I yield the balance of my time to the Chair.
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Volker, I want to thank you for being here today and I frankly found some of your opening statement to be not just genuine but downright eloquent. In particular I noted the passages about pushing back on Russian aggression and supporting the development of a strong, resilient, democratic and prosperous Ukraine. One that overcomes a legacy of corruption and that this is critically important for U.S. national security.
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Some of us believe that we’re not pushing back strongly enough on Russia. Some of us believe we’re not being supportive enough of the Ukraine, but one of our challenges is to go home to the people for whom we work and help explain to them why it is in our national security interest. You have an audience like you’ll never have again to look into the camera and tell the American public why it is important to support Ukraine, why it should matter to them if the biggest issue in their life is getting their kids off to school, paying their bills and the like. Sir.
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Why does it matter?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Thank you for that. So we’re here in part because under cover of a concern for general corruption, some of us believe there wasn’t. In fact, there was something quite nefarious as the alternative that there wasn’t a concern about general corruption. But reviewing the record on that, sir, is it not true that in March of this year, the department of defense certified Ukraine as having been sufficient, have made sufficient progress to continue to receive military assistance?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Is it not true that on April 21st President Zelinsky, when an overwhelming mandate was 73% of the vote based largely on his effort and advocacy for anti-corruption.
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Is it not true that this mandate was affirmed and expanded on July 21st when his party won one party control again on the basis of anti-corruption?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	In fact, subsequently he enacted sweeping reforms to combat anti-corruption, did he not?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And is it not true that everybody on the ground thought, or was filled with optimism that Ukraine was getting serious about combating corruption?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Ambassador Volker, did you know that one of the very first anti-corruption measures passed in the Ukraine was a law to provide for the impeachment of the President?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	It’s true, because he thought we should start with himself. I raise this because my friends on the other side of the aisle keep characterizing this impeachment inquiry as inherently wrong because, and I’m quoting them, “it will overturn an election, over and over it will overturn an election”. Well impeachment is an anti-corruption tool and for my friends on the other side of the aisle, yes, it does overturn an election. By definition it overturns an election. I don’t know if they’ve got a problem with our constitution and its provisions for impeachment, but I recommend they reread the relevant passages in article one, sections two and three and some of the history about how we got there. Look, none of us wants to be here despite what’s being said. None of us came to this easily. I didn’t. Where a call for the rest of my life, the 48 hours I spent at our family cabin literally plunged in self reflection and literally prayerful deliberation about this whole matter.
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Collectively, we are going to have to grapple with this very grave decision. It’s waiting and it’s going to get hard, and it’s hard in proportion to its importance to our great Republic. A Republic, if we can keep it. I yield back Mr. Chairman.
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	… pair of meetings on July 10th in ambassador Bolton’s office and down in the ward room where you witnessed Ambassador Sondland inform the Ukrainian officials that as a prerequisite to a White House meeting between the two presidents quote, Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens, end quote. You said that Ambassador Sondland was quote calling for an investigation that didn’t exist into the Bidens and Burisma. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	It’s that same afternoon you went to Mr. Eisenberg, the council, correct?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And did he not also tell you to feel free to come back if you had additional concerns?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Ambassador Sondland had told you that his request to the Ukrainians had been coordinated with the Chief of Staff, Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney. Did you report that to Mr. Eisenberg?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And what was his reaction?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Colonel, you’ve also testified that on the July 25th call now between the two presidents quote there was no doubt end quote that President Trump asked for investigations into the 2016 election and Vice President Biden’s son in return for a White House meeting. Within an hour of that call, you reported that to Mr. Eisenberg, did you not?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Went back to him just as he had suggested would be appropriate?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Did you tell the lawyers that President Trump asked President Zelensky to speak to Mr. Giuliani?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And the lawyers, it was at this point told you not to talk to anyone else?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Colonel, I want to go back to 2014 in Iraq when you were blown up. I presume that given the point in your military career and what else was going on in the world, that upon recovery there was the very real prospect or possibility that you might once again find yourself in harm’s way. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	’04, excuse me, thank you. Did you consider leaving the military service at that point?
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	But you could have been subjected to additional harm. You chose to continue service in uniform.
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	You know, Colonel, I have to say I find it a rich but incredibly painful irony that within a week of the President, contrary to all advice of the senior military officials, he pardons those who are convicted of war crimes, which was widely decried in the military community. Within the week of him doing that he’s engaged in an effort and allies on his behalf, including some here today, to demean your record of service, and the sacrifice, and the contribution you have made. Indeed, sir, less than 20 minutes ago, the White House officially quoted out, out of context, the comments referred to earlier by Mr. Morrison in your judgment.
0201-11-19	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	I can only conclude, sir, that what we thought was just the President as the subject of our deliberations in this inquiry isn’t sufficient to capture what’s happening here. Indeed, what’s subject to this inquiry and what is at peril is our constitution and the very values upon which it is based. I want to say thank you for your service, but thank you doesn’t cut it. Please know, however, that it comes from the bottom of my heart and I know from the bottoms of the heart of countless other Americans. Thank you for your service, sir. I yield back.
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Mr Kent. Some people have suggested that the real reason that president Trump’s pressure campaign on the Ukraine was to root out corruption in Ukraine. I’ve gone back and read the memorandum of call two or three times actually, and I don’t recall a single instance where the president ever used the word corruption, nor the word corrupt.
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	I know in answer to the chairman’s opening questions, you’d indicated you had gone back and read it about a month ago. Do you recall the president in that July 25th phone call with President Zelensky ever uttering the word corrupt or corruption?
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	And as a matter of record he didn’t, but he did manage to find time to mention his potential political rival in 2020.
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	You also answered, in response to the question from Mr Himes, that you’ve been working on the issue of corruption, literally for decades. I thank you for that on behalf of the american people. And indeed, on October 15th you testified about longstanding US policy meant to combat corruption in the Ukraine, championed by people such as former ambassador Maria Ivanovich. But Mr Kent, is it not true that, rather than fighting corruption in general and Ukraine, that what President Trump actually did was unceremoniously recall and remove Ambassador Ivanovich from her post in Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Those policies, which were indeed championed by ambassador Ivanovich.
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	You also testified on October 15th in the deposition about fundamental reforms necessary for Ukraine to fight corruption and to transform the country. And you cited the importance of reforming certain institutions, notably the security service in the Prosecutor General’s office. Was investigating President Trump’s political opponents a part of those necessary reforms? Was it on that list of yours, sir, or indeed, was it on any list?
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	In fact, historically, is it not true that a major problem in the Ukraine has been it’s misuse of prosecutors, precisely to conduct investigation of political opponents? That’s a legacy I dare suggest from the Soviet era when, as you stated in your testimony, prosecutors like the KGB were, and I quote you now, “Instruments of oppression.” Is that true?
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	So finally, Mr. Kent, for as long as I can remember, US foreign policy has been predicated on advancing principled entrance and democratic values, notably freedom of speech, press, assembly, religion, free fair and open elections, and the rule of law. Mr. Kent, when American leaders ask foreign governments to investigate their potential rivals, doesn’t that make it harder for us to advocate on behalf of those democratic values?
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	How is that, sir?
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor, would you agree with that, sir?
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Is there anything you’d like to add about how it might make it more difficult for you to do your job, sir?
2019-11-13	Denny Heck	D-Heck	Democrat	Anyone looking at the facts can see what happened was an abuse of power. Anyone looking at the facts can see that what happened was unethical. Anyone looking at the facts can see, anyone looking at the facts can see that what went on was just plain wrong.
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Dr. Hill, yesterday I think a lot of Americans were scratching their heads as Ambassador Sondland testified that on September 9, he calls the President of the United States and just says broadly, ?What do you want from Ukraine?? And the president says, ?There?s no quid pro quo. There?s no quid pro quo.? It?s like being pulled over for speeding and being asked, ?Do you know how fast you?re going?? and saying, ?I didn?t rob the bank. I didn?t rob the bank.
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	But your testimony today is that on July 10 of this year, you told one of the president?s lawyers that you had concerns that a White House meeting was linked to investigations. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And so as early as July 10, the president?s lawyers had knowledge that there was at least concern by a presidential employee about a linkage. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Dr. Hill, just like you are, we are trying to account for all the President?s men. You had that same concern when you saw Mr. Sondland?s emails, and you saw people who were outside the channels that you had been working on. So I want to walk you through something you told us earlier. You said that you have evidence that as recently as this year, President Trump believes someone named Kash was the Ukraine director. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	But you heard that that name Kash. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And the only person at the time who worked at the National Security Council was Kash Patel. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And Kash Patel, prior to working for the National Security Council from 2017 to 2018, worked for ranking member Nunes. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And Dr. Hill, you cautioned us on the dangers of members of this committee perhaps pedaling any Ukrainian conspiracy theories that could benefit Russia, and I want to ask you if you have heard the name Lev Parnas of Ukraine, someone in this investigation who was influencing President Trump and Rudy Giuliani about some of the debunked conspiracy theories you referenced earlier?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Are you aware that Mr. Parnas was indicted on October 10 for making foreign contributions to Republicans in U.S. elections?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Are you aware of yesterday?s Daily Beast story reporting the indicted Ukrainian Lev Parnas has been working with the ranking member Devin Nunes on Mr. Nunes? overseas investigations?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to put into the record the Daily Beast story, Lev Parnas helped rep Devin Nunes? Investigations from yesterday, first two paragraphs reading, ?Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani, helped arrange meetings and calls in Europe for rep Devin Nunes in 2018. Parnas? lawyer, Ed McMahon, told the Daily Beast. Nunes? aide Derek Harvey participated in the meetings, the lawyer said, which were arranged to help Nunes? investigative work. McMahon didn?t specify what those investigations entailed.
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, you have been falsely accused throughout these proceedings by the ranking member as being a quote/unquote ?fact witness.? Now, if this story is correct, the ranking member may have actually been projecting, and in fact he may be the fact witness if he is working with indicted individuals around our investigation.
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	But I want to go to what this is really all about. First, it?s your credibility, Mr. Holmes. And can you tell us and confirm that in 2014 you received the William Rivkin Constructive Dissent Award from the Obama administration State Department?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And that was for dissent that you brought up against an administration policy. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Congratulations, and thank you for speaking up in the way that you did. But what we?re really here about is what you?re working on in Ukraine, and I want you to take a look at the picture. Who do you see in the foreground of that photo?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	That?s a photograph in May 2019, where newly elected president Zelensky visited the Luhansk region in Eastern Ukraine. It was his first visit to the front lines of Donbass as president. Can you just tell tax-paying Americans why it?s so important that our hard-earned tax-paying dollars help President Zelensky and the men standing beside him fight against Russia in this hot war?
2019-11-21	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Thank you. And Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to enter the May 27 photograph depicted on the screen into the record.
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Professor Turley is a former prosecutor. I recognize the defense attorney trying to represent their client, especially one who has very little to work with, in the way of facts. And today, you’re representing the Republicans in their defense of the president. Professor, you said-
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	You’ve said that, “This case represents a dramatic turning point in federal impeachment precedent, the impact of which will shape and determine future cases. The house for the first time in the modern era asks the Senate to remove someone for conduct for which he was never charged criminally and the impropriety of which has never been tested in a court of law.” But that’s actually not a direct quote from what you said today. It sounds a lot like what you’ve argued today, but that’s a quote from what you argued as a defense lawyer in a 2010 Senate impeachment trial. Professor, did you represent Federal Judge Thomas Porteous?
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And Judge Porteous was tried on four articles of impeachment ranging from engaging in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a federal judge to engaging in a longstanding pattern of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as the United States district court judge. On each count, Judge Porteous was convicted by at least 68 and up to 96 bi-partisan senators.
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Thankfully, that senate did not buy your argument that a federal official should not be removed if he’s not charged criminally. And respectfully, Professor, we don’t buy it either, but we’re here because of this photo. It’s a picture of President Zelensky in may of this year, standing on the eastern front of Ukraine as a hot war was taking place and up to 15,000 Ukrainians have died at the hands of Russians.
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	I’d like to focus on the impact of President Trump’s conduct, particularly with our allies and our standing in the world. This isn’t just a president, as Professor Karlan has pointed out, asking for another foreign leader to investigate a political opponent and also is a president leveraging a White House visit as well as foreign aid. As the witnesses have testified, Ukraine needs our support to defend itself against Russia. I heard directly from witnesses how important the visit and aid were, particularly from Ambassador Taylor.
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Professor Karlan, does the president’s decision to withhold from Ukraine such important official acts, the White House visit and military aid in order to pressure President Zelensky relate to the framers concerns about abusive power and entanglements with foreign nations?
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Professor Karlan, I think you’d agree we are a nation of immigrants.
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Today, 50 million immigrants live in the United States. I’m moved by one who recently told me, as I was checking into a hotel, about his Romanian family. He came here from Romania and said that every time he had gone home for the last 20 years, he would always tell his family members how corrupt his country was that he had left and why he’d come to the United States.
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And he told me, in such accumulating fashion, that when he has gone home recently, they now wag their finger at him and say, “You’re going to lecture us about corruption?” What do you think, Professor Karlan, does the president’s conduct say to the millions of Americans who left their families and livelihoods to come to a country that represents the rule of law?
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Thank, Karlan. Finally, Professor Feldman, Professor Turley has pointed out that we should wait and that we should go to the courts, but you would acknowledge that we’ve gone to the courts. We’ve been in the courts for over six months, many times on matters that are already settled in the United States Supreme Court, particularly US v. Nixon, where the president seems to be running out the clock. Is that right?
2019-12-04	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Thank you, and I yield back.
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, would you welcome the problem of having 8,000 documents given to you from the White House?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	How many have they given you?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Castor, You said earlier that they got the aid, they got the aid, no harm, no foul. They got the aid. But you would agree that although Mr. Sandy said that the presidential concern was European contributions, nothing changed from when that concern was expressed to when they actually got the age, right? Do you agree on that? Europe didn’t kick in a bunch of new money.
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Oh, a study. Okay. But they didn’t kick in new money. Do you agree on that?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Okay. So you talked a lot about the anti-corruption president that we have in Donald Trump. The person who had a fraud settlement relating to Trump University. The person who just recently with his own charity had a settlement related to fraud. Let’s talk about that anti-corruption president of ours. Take a wild guess, Mr. Castor, how many times has president Trump met with Vladimir Putin or talk to him?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	It’s 16. How many times has president Trump met at the white house with president Zelensky? It’s zero. And who is president Trump meeting with at the White House tomorrow. Do you know?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	It’s Russian foreign minister Lavrov. Now, Mr. Goldman withholding aid from Ukraine obviously hurts Ukraine. It hurts the United States. Does it help any country?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Did you also hear testimony that these acts by the president while being wrong and an abuse of power also harmed US national security?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Did you hear anything about how it would harm our credibility? And I would turn you to a conversation ambassador Volker had on September 14 of this year with a senior Ukrainian official. Where ambassador Volker is impressing upon that official that president Zelensky should not investigate his own political opponents. What was thrown back in the face of ambassador Volker?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	During Watergate, the famous phrase from Senator Howard Baker was asked, what did the president know and when did he know it? There’s a reason that no one here has repeated those questions during these hearings. We know what the president did and we know when he knew it. Mr. Goldman, who sent Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to smear Joe Biden?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who fired the anti-corruption ambassador in Ukraine, Maria Yovanovitch?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who told ambassador Sondland and ambassador Volker to work with Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who told vice president Pence to not go to president’s Zelensky’s inauguration?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who ordered his own chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney to withhold critical military assistance for Ukraine?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who refused to meet with president Zelensky in the oval office?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who ignored on July 25 his own national security council’s anti-corruption talking points?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who asked president Zelensky for a favor?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who personally asked president Zelensky to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who stood on the White House lawn and confirmed that he wanted Ukraine to investigate vice president Biden?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Who stood on that same line and said that China should also investigate vice president Biden?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	As to anything that we do not know in this investigation, who has blocked us from knowing it?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	So as it relates to president Trump, is he an incidental player or a central player, in this scheme?
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	There’s a reason that no one has said, “What did the president know and when did he know it.” From the evidence that you have presented Mr. Goldman and the intelligence committees findings, we know one thing and one thing is clear…
2019-12-09	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Intelligence Committee’s findings. We know one thing and one thing is clear, as it related to this scheme, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, knew everything. And I yield back.
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, a lot has changed since the whistleblower came forward. Two things in particular. First, most of what the whistleblower has alleged has been corroborated by the witnesses that we have heard from. Second, the President, who my colleagues so shamelessly continue to defend, continue to pressure, threaten and intimidate the whistleblower. So, I’d like unanimous consent to put into the record a September 26, 2019 article from Business Insider. Trump suggested the whistleblower, who filed a complaint against him, is guilty of treason, which is punishable by death.
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	How about September 26, 2019, Vanity Fair? Trump suggests executing the whistleblower’s sources like, quote, “In the good old days.” Third.
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	September 29th, whistleblower’s lawyer raises fear for client’s safety, from Axios.
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, the whistleblower has an absolute right to anonymity. The whistleblower’s lawyer has said that he fears for his personal safety and will only answer questions now in writing. I wish my colleagues would join me in protecting the whistleblower’s right to anonymity.
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	But here, Miss Yovanovitch, we are here to talk about you and what you witnessed. And you saw a lot as it related to Mr. Giuliani, and I want to read a quote to you from Mr. Giuliani, but first ask you, when you were in Ukraine you understood that Rudy Giuliani was Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is that right?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Are you familiar with Rudy Giuliani’s quote in the New York Times describing himself as the lawyer saying quote, “He basically knows what I’m doing, sure, as his lawyer.” Were you familiar with that quote?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And you have a lawyer with you today, Miss Yovanovitch, and you understand that lawyers act on their client’s behalf, is that right?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	That it would be improper for a lawyer to go outside any directive that a client gives, is that right?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Are you familiar with a New York Times story on May 9, 2019, where Rudy Giuliani says that he intends to visit Ukraine and says, “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation.” Are you familiar with that quote?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	That’s 11 days before you were removed as Ambassador, is that right?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	He is talking publicly about designs on coming to Ukraine, but what I think is interesting is that Mr. Giuliani says we’re, as an we are. He doesn’t say I am not meddling in an election. He doesn’t say I’m not meddling in an investigation. He says, “We.” He’s speaking for himself and his client. And I want to talk about that quote, “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation.” Is it proper for you or anyone who acts on behalf of the United States Government to meddle in an investigation?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Why not?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Now this anti-corruption crusader President Trump, who my colleagues have touted out as having such a great interest in anti-corruption, in both the calls that have been referenced today, the August 21 call and the July 25 call, isn’t it true that President Trump never mentions the word corruption?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And as far as the foreign aid that my colleagues keeps saying, “Well he can’t be guilty. He didn’t complete the cheat. The aid went to the Ukrainians.” Isn’t it true that the only reason the aid or the only time the aid went to the Ukrainians was after the whistleblower complaint became public?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	So, you don’t really get points when you get your hand caught in the cookie jar and someone says, “Hey, he’s got his hand in the cookie jar,” and then you take your hand out. Which is essentially what my Republican colleagues and the President are trying to take credit for.
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Finally, I want to put up the disgusting tweet from the President today, where he attacks your character. But I think I know who you are, Ambassador. I think the country knows who you are. He smeared you when you were in Ukraine. He smeared you on that phone call with President Zelensky on July 25. He is smearing you right now as you’re testifying. Ambassador Yovanovitch, are the President’s smears going to stop you from fighting corruption?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And if your country asks you again to fight corruption, will you still do that despite the smears?
0201-11-15	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Thank you. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Thank you. Mr. Morrison, did Ambassador Bolton want the security aid hold lifted?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	You testified that Ambassador Bolton had a one-on-one meeting with President Trump in late August related to Ukraine security assistance. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	On page 266, you said, “Ambassador Bolton had a one-on-one meeting with President Trump in late August 2019, but the president was not yet ready to approve the release of the assistance.” Do you remember that?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Yes, 266 and 268. But I’m asking you, did that happen, or did it not?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And you testified to that. What was the outcome of that meeting between Ambassador Bolton and President Trump?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Did Ambassador Bolton inform you of any reason for the ongoing hold that stemmed from this meeting?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Morrison, do you consider yourself loyal to the president?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And the president executes the foreign policy of the United States. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	He sets the foreign policy.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And as a staffer on the National Security Council and even someone who serves in the military, it’s your job to faithfully execute the foreign policy priorities of the president. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	On July 25, you listened to the president of the United States talk to the president of Ukraine. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And regardless of what you had prepared as far as talking points for that call for the president, you heard the president of the United States ask the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And after the July 25 call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, fair to say that you talked to your Ukrainian counterparts a number of times?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	How many times, when you talk to your Ukrainian counterparts, did you ask them to investigate the Bidens?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Why not?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	But with all due respect, Mr. Morrison, you’re not in the White House to carry out your policy objectives. You just testified that the president sets the foreign policy objectives for the United States. And the one call that you listened to between the president of the United States and the president of Ukraine, the president of the United States’ priorities were to investigate the Bidens. And I’m asking you, sir, why didn’t you follow up on the president’s priorities when you talked to the Ukrainians?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Morrison, I know that you put that conversation in the server because-
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	I know that you put that conversation in the server because as you said, you feared the political consequences and some other reasons that you gave, but you also chose to defy the President’s request to not come here as others have, like Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Bolton, and you have come here and you’ve been truthful and I appreciate that. And Mr. Morrison, whether you acknowledge it publicly or not, I believe that you knew that what the President asked the Ukrainians to do was wrong.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And as you just described, your duty is to follow the foreign policy priorities of the President, but to also only follow something that is a lawful order. And I don’t think you believe that was a lawful order and that’s why you did not follow up on those priorities.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Mr. Volker, we’ve heard a lot today about this president being such an anti-corruption president. He really cared about fighting corruption. Is Russia a corrupt country?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	No, President Trump.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Is Russia a corrupt country?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And President Trump has met a number of times in person with President Putin, is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And he’s had a number of phone calls with President Putin, is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Is Turkey a corrupt country?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And just last week, despite their corruption at the White House, President Erdogan had an audience with the President of the United States, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Finally, Mr. Giuliani on May 9th told the New York Times, President Trump basically knows what I’m doing as his lawyer. Are you familiar with that statement to the New York Times?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	But you agree as someone who has a lawyer sitting next to you that a lawyer acts on a client’s behalf and only on a client’s behalf, is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And when he said, we’re not meddling in an election or meddling in an investigation, he didn’t say I, he said we. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Yield back.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Thank you both Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. I think the followup question that my colleague from New York did not ask you but is relevant for everyone at home. Isn’t it true that the department of defense had certified that the anti-corruption requirements of Ukraine had been met when the hold was put on by the president?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Now, Mr. Jordan suggested that the president did something, none of us expected by releasing that call transcript. You listened to the call, is that right Lieutenant Colonel?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Ms. Williams. You also listen to the calls is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Fair to say Ms. Williams. A lot of other people at the White House listen to the call or read the transcript.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And the transcript was distributed to others. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	So the president is asking for us and his defenders to give him a gold star because a number of people listen to the call or saw the call transcript and then he released it. The difference of course between this and say his one on one meeting in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin was there. It was a one on one meeting and he took the notes from the interpreter so none of us could see it. The point being the president had no choice but to release a call that everyone had seen. Now you’ve been asked to also characterize what exactly legally all of this means and Mr. Ratcliffe pointed out that no one had used the term bribery in our depositions and Ms. Williams, you’re not a lawyer, are you?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman? Are you a lawyer?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	The lawyers, your brother, right? Born 20 seconds after you, is that what you said?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Nine minutes after you, you’re the older brother.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Now I want to give you a hypothetical here. Suppose you have a shooting victim and the police respond after the victim is doing a little bit better and they ask the victim will tell us what happened. And the victim says, “Well someone came up to my car, shot into the car, hit me in the shoulder, hit me in the back, hit me in the neck. Miraculously I survived, but I can identify who the person is that pulled the trigger.” The police say, “Okay, you were shot, you know who it is but shucks. You didn’t tell us that this was an attempted murder, so we’re going to have to let the person go.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Is that how it works in our justice system that unless victims or witnesses identify the legal theories of a case, we just let people off the hook. Is that how it works Lieutenant Colonel Vindman?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	I don’t think your brother would think so either. Ms. Williams, Vice President Pence was described to our committee by Mr. Morrison as a quote, “Voracious reader of his intelligence read book.” And after the April 21 call with President Zelensky, you put a transcript of that call in the vice president’s read book, is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And then the vice president called President Zelensky two days later, is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And you told us in the deposition that he stuck pretty faithfully to what President Trump had said in that April 21 call, is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And you would describe the vice president is somebody who would make followup calls to world leaders after the president had done so. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And in that case, he stuck to President Trump’s talking points.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And as was stated earlier, the president sets the foreign policy for the United States. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And you told us that after the July 25 call between President Trump and President Zelensky that you put the call transcript in Vice President Pence’s intelligence briefing book. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	So let’s flash forward to September one Vice President Pence meets with President Zelensky. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	You’re there?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And President Zelensky with Vice President Pence. They talk about a lot of things, but you will agree that Vice President Pence did not bring up the Bidens. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	He did not bring up investigations.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Is one reasonable explanation that although Vice President Pence will do a lot of things for President Trump, that he was not willing to bring up investigations in Biden’s because he thought it was wrong.
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	But you didn’t bring it up with the Ukrainians after the July 25 call, right?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And you did not either?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, did you ever ask the Ukrainians to do what President Trump was asking them to do after the July 25 phone call?
0201-11-19	Eric Swalwell	D-Swalwell	Democrat	Thank you. Yield then.
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, thank you. And Dr. Hill, Mr. Holmes, thank you both for being fact witnesses. We are here as fact finders and we appreciate very much your presentations. Dr. Hill, I want to verify this story. I understand that when you were 11 years old, there was a school boy who set your pigtails on fire and you were taking a test. You turned around and, with your hands, snuffed out the fire and then proceeded to finish your test. Is that a true story?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Well, I think it underscores the fact that you speak truth, that you are steely, and I truly respect that. Let me move to your testimony and your deposition. You had indicated you are deeply troubled by Ambassador Yovanovitch?s ? The attacks on her. You underscored again today that all ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president. And certainly, in the case of Ambassador Yovanovitch, he could have just asked her to come home, but that didn?t happen.
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	In fact, there was a systematic character assassination that went on and went on from 2018, if I?m not mistaken. But you say, ? And the most obvious explanation at this point, it has to be said, seem to be business dealings of individuals who wanted to improve their investment positions inside of Ukraine itself.? You were then asked, ?Who do you understand was responsible for her removal?? And you said, ?I understand this to be the result of the campaign that Mr. Giuliani had set in motion in conjunction with people who were writing articles and, you know, publications that I would have expected better of. And also, you know, just the constant drum beat of these accusations that he was making on the television.
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Rudy Giuliani was playing fast and furious in Ukraine, it would appear. Is that correct?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	He had no official tasking within the administration, is that correct?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	But he frequently met with Ukrainian officials to request that they open an investigation?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	? in an investigation.
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	You testified that Mr. Giuliani?s involvement was quote, ?A massive complication in terms of our engagement with Ukraine.
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Would you like to explain that?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So how did Mr. Giuliani?s involvement affect?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right.
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Mr. Holmes, you talked about the extraordinary power that Russia tries to assert against Ukraine. So since President Zelensky never got his White House meeting, doesn?t that make Ukraine look weak, and doesn?t that benefit Russia?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right, so promoting Putin?s false claim of Ukraine intervention into the U.S. election also benefits Russia, doesn?t it?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So when President Trump meets privately with Vladimir Putin at the G20 Summit, who does that benefit?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	It doesn?t help Ukraine. And by President Trump calling Ukraine corrupt and not North Korea, for instance, does that accrue to Russia?s benefit?
2019-11-21	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right. I thank you, and Mr. Chairman, I?ll yield the rest of my time to you.
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ambassador, so very much. You are confirmed by the Senate on a voice vote, weren’t you?
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So unanimous, Republicans and Democrats, correct?
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	No dispute. You said that in summer of 2018, the smear campaign began in your testimony earlier today. Did Secretary Pompeo at any time come to your aid?
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So it appears that back in 2018, the President was already making noises that he wanted you out of there. It appears that as early as April of 2018, Mr. Parnass was at a fundraiser for the President, and recommended that you be removed, and then subsequently in May of 2018 was pictured at a White House dinner with the President, and then later in May made a contribution of over $325,000 illegally to the President’s reelection campaign. Are you aware of that?
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Does that help you understand a little bit more why this smear campaign was under way?
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right. You made some very riveting comments in your statement this morning that I just want to repeat because I think we should have you expand on it. You said, “I’ve always understood that I served at the pleasure of the President. I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine US interest in this way. Individuals who apparently felt stymied by our efforts to promote stated US policy against corruption, that is to do our mission, were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador using unofficial back channels.
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Now, as I listened to you make that statement, I was thinking of all the other persons in the foreign service who now have to be concerned that it’s not good enough to follow the stated US foreign policy, but also to be aware that maybe the President has a back channel of interests that he is promoting that is diametrically opposed to our stated foreign policy. Can you expand on that please?
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	But in this case, the Tres Amigos appeared to be more interested in getting an investigation than into promoting an anti corruption effort in Ukraine. Is that correct?
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	You were told at one point in 2019 in February, earlier this year, you spoke to a minister and Ukraine who warned that when it came to Rudy Giuliani, you needed to, quote, “Watch your back.” What did you understand him to mean?
0201-11-15	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Let me just say to conclude that you have endured an orchestrated character assassination, that it was hatched over a year and a half ago, and that it’s laced with enormous campaign contributions to the President’s reelection campaign. And you deserve more from the American people, and you deserve more from Congress in supporting you. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank you both for your participation here today and for your service. I’m going to take us out some 30,000 feet for a minute and talk about cover-ups. But for the fact that the whistleblower came forward, we wouldn’t know anything about this. But for the fact that the inspector general of the CIA found it to be both urgent and credible, we wouldn’t know anything about it.
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Mr. Morrison, you said that after you heard the call, you went directly to the attorneys in the National Security Council and recommended that they be limited access, and they were subsequently put into a special server. The White House has not released any documents whatsoever to this committee.
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So to you, Mr. Volker, thank you. But for the fact that you, as a private citizen with your own personal phone and your text messages with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Sondland and Mr. [Myak 01:08:02] and whomever else, but for those text messages that we’ve been putting up on the screen all day, we would have nothing, nothing. And this cover-up would be complete. That’s something we should think about. Now, on July 19th, you had breakfast with Rudy Giuliani at the Trump Hotel. Correct?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	And in that conversation, at one point, he brought up Mr. Lutsenko, and you said that whatever Mr. Lutsenko is saying, that’s not credible. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	And then he brought up Mr. Biden, and I’m going to quote you here. “I’ve known him for a long time. He’s a person of integrity.” To Giuliani, “Simply not credible to me Joe Biden would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money or things for his son or anything like that.
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Now, we’ve had many discussions over the last few days about these investigations into Burisma and Biden and the 2016 CrowdStrike server. And you, in that conversation with Mr. Giuliani, basically debunked all of that. Now, at that time, at that breakfast, who else was with you at that breakfast?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So Mr. Lev Parnas was at that breakfast that Mr. Giuliani had with you, and we now know that Mr. Parnas has since been indicted for foreign campaign contributions to President Trump’s political action committee. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right. On May 23rd, you were in that discussion with the president, and at one point, he referred to Zelensky having terrible people around him. Who do you think he was calling terrible people around him?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Do you think of them as terrible people?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right, thank you. Mr. Morrison, earlier in testimony that was elicited from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you indicated that others had represented to you that Colonel Vindman leaked. Do you remember saying that?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right. Colonel Vindman, this morning under oath, said that he did not, does not leak. Now, would you therefore want to maybe rearrange your comments about the references you made to Colonel Vindman?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So even though under oath, he said that he has never leaked, you believe in people who said to you that he may have leaked?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Well, they told you, and so then you decided to continue to put that forward, even though you had no evidence.
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Thank you. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you both for your testimony and your service. Colonel Vindman, wasn’t it the case that Mr. Eisenberg, the attorney, had said to you after the July 5th meeting that you should come to him if you have any other concerns?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	And it is not going outside the chain of command to speak to the lawyer within the institution, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been complaining about other witnesses having only secondhand information, but in both your cases you have firsthand information because you were on the July 25th phone call, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Now, Colonel, you in your comments today said, “I want to state that the vile character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible.” Would you like to expand on that at all?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So in both your situations, since you have given depositions, since those depositions have been made public, have you seen your experience in your respective jobs change or have you been treated any differently?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So in some respects then there have been reprisals?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Thank you. In preparation for the July 25th phone call, it’s standard for the National Security Council to provide talking points. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Because the words of the President carry incredible weight. Is that not correct?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So it’s important to ensure that everyone has carefully considered the implications of what the President might say to a foreign leader.
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Colonel Vindman, you are the National Security Council’s director for Ukraine, did you participate in preparing the talking points for the president’s call?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	So you prepared them, they were then reviewed and edited by multiple senior officers at the NSC and the White House. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Did the talking points for the President contained any discussion of investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens or Burisma?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Are you aware of any written product from the National Security Council suggesting that investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens or Burisma are part of the official policy of the United States?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Some of President Trump’s allies have suggested that the President requested these investigations for official policy reasons, as part of some plan to root out corruption in Ukraine. In your experience, did the official policies of the United States include asking Ukraine to specifically open investigations into the Bidens and interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Would it ever be U.S. policy in your experience to ask a foreign leader to open a political investigation?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Ms. Williams, in your experience, did the official policies of the United States include asking Ukraine to open investigations into the Bidens?
0201-11-19	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	All right. Let me just say to you, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman that in listening to your opening statement, I had chills up and down my spine and I think most Americans recognize what an extraordinary hero you are to our country. And I would say to your father, he did well. I yield back.
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you both for your true heroic efforts, both tonight, today, and also throughout your careers. I’d like to start with you, Mr. Kent. In your testimony, you said that you had, “In mid-August, it became clear to me that Giuliani’s efforts to gin up politically motivated investigations were now infecting US engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President’s Zelensky’s desire for a White House meeting.” Mr. Kent, did you actually write a memo documenting your concerns that there was an effort underway to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation to benefit President Trump?
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	But we don’t have access to that memo, do we?
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	And we have not received one piece of paper from the State Department relative to this investigation. Both of you have made compelling cases of the importance of Ukraine to Europe, to the 70 years of peace, the benefit that it has to the United States national security, and our goal to continue to support sovereignty of nations. Meanwhile, Russia is violently attacking people in Ukraine in the Donbass area. So withholding military aid, does that weaken Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Does it embolden Russia when there was no aid being sent to Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Thank you. Ambassador Taylor, I think you mentioned that a White House meeting for Zelensky would boost his ability to negotiate for a peaceful settlement with Vladimir Putin and Russia in general. Is that true?
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	But he has not yet had that White House meeting has he?
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	I think it’s ironic that Soviet born Lev Parnas, who has now been indicted, had a meeting with the President in the White House after participating in a number of campaign events for the President, and contributing $325,000 to the President’s PAC. So maybe it’s actually the requirement that you give money to the President’s PAC in order to get that meeting at the White House.
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor, is it true that the prosecutor general now has opened an investigation in Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Yes. But is he-
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	Has he specified what investigations he’s undertaken?
2019-11-13	Jackie Speier	D-Speier	Democrat	He has not. All right. I yield the rest of my time to Chairman Schiff.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	This is the first hearing we are conducting pursuant to house resolution 660 and the` special judiciary committee procedures that are described in section 4A of that resolution. Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I will make an opening statement and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement. Each witness will have 10 minutes to make their statements and then we will proceed to questions. I will not recognize myself for an opening statement.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I have the time for an opening statement to parliamentary and inquiry, is not in order at this time.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The facts before us are undisputed. On July 25th President Trump called President Zelinsky of Ukraine and in President Trump’s words asked him for a favor. That call was part of a concerted effort by the President and his men to solicit a personal advantage in the next election. This time in the form of an investigation of his political adversaries by a foreign government. To obtain that private political advantage, President Trump withheld both an official White House meeting from the newly elected president of a fragile democracy. And withheld vital military aid from a vulnerable ally.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	When Congress found out about this scheme and began to investigate, President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to cover up his efforts and to withhold evidence from the investigators. And when witnesses disobeyed him, when career professionals came forward and told us the truth, he attacked them viciously. Calling them traders and liars, promising that they will quote “Go through some things.” Closed quote.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Of course, this is not the first time that President Trump has engaged in this pattern of conduct. In 2016 the Russian government engaged in a sweeping and systematic campaign of interference in our elections. In the words of special counsel, Robert Mueller, quote, “The Russian government perceived that would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome.” Closed quote.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The president welcomed that interference. We saw this in real time when President Trump asked Russia to hack his political opponents. The very next day, a Russian Military Intelligence Unit attempted to hack that political opponent. When his own justice department tried to uncover the extent to which a foreign government had broken our laws, President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to obstruct the investigation. Including ignoring subpoenas, ordering the creation of false records, and publicly attacking and intimidating witnesses.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Then as now, this administration’s level of obstruction is without precedent. No other president has vowed to quote, “Fight all of the subpoenas.” Unquote, as President Trump promised.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	In the 1974 impeachment proceedings, President Nixon produced dozens of recordings. In 1998 President Clinton physically gave his blood. President Trump by contrast, has refuse to produce a single document and directed every witness not to testify. Those are the facts before us.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The impeachment inquiry has moved back to the House Judiciary Committee. And as we begin to review of these facts, the President’s pattern of behavior becomes clear. President Trump welcomed foreign interference in the 2016 election. He demanded it for the 2020 election. In both cases, he got caught. And in both cases he did everything in his power to prevent the American people from learning the truth about his conduct.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	On July 24th the Special Counsel testified before this committee. He implored us to see the nature of the threat to our country. “Over the course of my career, I have seen a number of challenges to our democracy. The Russian government’s efforts to interfere in our elections is among the most serious. This deserves the attention of every American.” closed quote. Ignoring that warning, President Trump called the Ukrainian president the very next day to ask him to investigate the president’s political opponents.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	As we exercise our responsibility to determine whether this pattern of behavior constitutes an impeachable offense, it is important to place President Trump’s conduct into historical context. Since the founding of our country, the House of Representatives has impeached only two presidents. A third was on his way to impeachment when he resigned. This committee has voted to impeach two presidents for obstructing justice. We have voted to impeach one president for obstructing a congressional investigation. To the extent that President Trump’s conduct fits these categories. There is precedent for recommending impeachment here. But never before in the history of the Republic have we been forced to consider the conduct of a president who appears to have solicited personal political favors from a foreign government. Never before has a president engage in a course of conduct that included all of the acts that most concerned the framers.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The patriots who founded our country were not fearful men. They fought a war. They witnessed terrible violence. They overthrew a King. But as they met to frame our constitution, those patriots still feared one threat above all, foreign interference in our elections. They just opposed a tyrant. They were deeply worried that we would lose our new found liberty, not through a war. If a foreign army were to invade, we would see that coming. But through corruption from within. And in the early years of the Republic, they asked us, each of us to be vigilant to that threat.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Washington warned us, quote, “To be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influences is one of the most painful foes of Republican government.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Adams wrote to Jefferson quote, “As often as elections happen, the danger of foreign influence recurs.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Hamilton’s warning was more specific and more dire. In the Federalist papers he wrote that the quote, “Most deadly adversaries of Republican government,” unquote. Would almost certainly attempt to quote, “Raise a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the union.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	In short, the founders warned us that we should expect our foreign adversaries to target our elections. And that we will find ourselves in grave danger if the president willingly opens the door to their influence. What kind of president would do that? How will we know if the president has betrayed his country in this manner? How will we know if he has betrayed his country in this manner for petty, personal gain.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Hamilton editors had a response for that as well. He wrote, “When a man unprincipled in private life, desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, known to have scoffed in private at the principles of Liberty. When such a man is seen to Mount the hobbyhorse of popularity to join the cry of danger to liberty, to take every opportunity of embarrassing the general government and bringing it under suspicion. It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion. That he may ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Ladies and gentlemen, the storm in which we find ourselves today was set in motion by President Trump. I do not wish this moment on the country. It is not a pleasant task that we undertake today. But we have each taken an oath to protect the Constitution and the facts before us are clear. President Trump did not merely seek to benefit from foreign interference in our elections. He directly and explicitly invited foreign interference in our elections. He used the powers of his office to try to make it happen. He sent his agents to make clear that this is what he wanted and demanded. He was willing to compromise our security and his office for personal political gain. It does not matter that President Trump got caught and ultimately released the funds that Ukraine so desperately needed. It matters that he enlisted a foreign government to intervene in our elections in the first place.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	It does not matter that President Trump felt that these investigations were unfair to him. It matters that he used office not merely to defend himself, but to obstruct investigators at every turn.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	We are all aware that the next election is looming, but we cannot wait for the election to address the present crisis. The integrity of that election is one of the very things at stake. The President has shown us his pattern of conduct if we do not act to hold him in check now, President Trump will almost certainly try again to solicit interference in the election for his personal political gain.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Today we will begin our conversation where we should, with the text of the Constitution. We are empowered to recommend the impeachment of President Trump to the House if we find that he has committed treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Our witness panel will help us to guide that conversation. In a few days we will reconvene and hear from the committees that worked to uncover the facts before us. And when we apply the constitution to those facts, if it is true that President Trump has committed an impeachable offense or multiple of impeachable offenses, then we must move swiftly to do our duty and charge him accordingly.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I thank the witnesses for being here today. I now recognize the ranking member of the judiciary committees.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	His opening statement.  Doug Collins Opening Statement
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentlemen is not in order to offer a motion at this time.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The witness will proceed.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman will suspend, the time is the witnesses’.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	In between the witnesses it may be recognized, not once I recognize the witness.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The witness will proceed. We’ll entertain the motion after the first witness.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Who seeks recognition?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	For what purpose does the gentleman seek recognition?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman has stated his motion. Do I hear a motion to table?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Motion is to table. All in favor say, “Aye.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Opposed, “No.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The motion to table is approved. The roll call is requested. The Clerk will call the roll.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Has everyone voted who wishes to votes?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Is there anyone else who wishes to votes?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Anyone else? The Clerk will report.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The motion to table is adopted. We will now proceed to the first round of questions. Pursuant to House Resolution 660 and its accompanied Judiciary Committee procedures, there will be 45 minutes of questions conducted by the Chairman or Majority counsel, followed by 45 minutes for the Ranking Member or Minority counsel. Only the Chair and Ranking Member and their respective counsels may question witnesses during this period. Following that, unless I specify additional equal time for extended questioning, we will proceed under the Five Minute Rule, and every member will have the chance to ask questions. I now recognize myself for the first round of questions.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Professors, thank you for being here today. The Committee has been charged with the grave responsibility of considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the President. I speak for my colleagues when I say that we do not take this lightly. We are committed to ensuring that today’s hearing, as well as the larger responsibility before us, are grounded in the Constitution. Intelligence Committee’s report concluded that the President pressured a foreign leader to interfere in our elections by initiating and announcing investigations into President Trump’s political adversaries. He then sought to prevent Congress from investigating his conduct by ordering his administration and everyone in it to defy House subpoenas. Professor Karlan, as you said, the right to vote is the most precious legal right we have in this country. Does the President’s conduct endanger that right?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you. How does it do so?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you. Professor Gerhardt, you have written extensively about our system of checks and balances. What happens to that system when a President undertakes a blockade of Congress’ impeachment inquiry? When he orders all witnesses not to testify? What is our recourse?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The same is true of defying Congressional subpoenas, on a wholesale basis, with respect to oversight, not just to impeachment?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you. Professor Feldman, as I understand it, the Framers intended impeachment to be used infrequently, not as punishment, but to save our democracy from threats so significant that we cannot wait for the next election. In your testimony, you suggest that we face that kind of threat. Can you explain why you think impeachment is the appropriate recourse here? Why we cannot wait for the next election? Those are two questions, if you want them to be.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you very much. I now yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Eisen for counsel questions. Mr. Eisen.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	My time has expired. I yield back. Before I recognize the ranking member for his first round of questions, the committee will stand in a 10-minute humanitarian recess. I ask everyone in the room to please remain seated and quiet while the witnesses exit the room. I also want to announce to those in the audience that you may not be guaranteed your seat if you leave the hearing room at this time.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Once the witnesses have left the hearing room, at this time, the committee will stand in a short recess.  (Recess)
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	… the ranking member or his counsel have 45 minutes to question the witnesses. Ranking member.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentleman yields back. I note that this is the moment in which the White House would have had an opportunity to question the witnesses, but they declined our invitation. So we will now proceed to questions under the five minute rule. I yield myself five minutes for the purpose of questioning the witnesses. Professor Feldman, would you respond to professor Turley’s comments about bribery, especially about the relevance of the elements of criminal bribery?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	So the Supreme court case in McDonald interpreting the federal bribery statute and other decisions interpreting the statutes would not be relevant?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you. Professor Gerhardt, would you respond to Professor Turley’s comments about obstruction of justice or obstruction of Congress please?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Professor Turley implied that as long as the president asserts a fanciful, ultimately non-existent privilege, like absolute immunity, he can’t be charged with obstruction of Congress because after all, it hasn’t gone through the courts yet. Would you comment on that? Professor Gerhardt?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Professor Turley implied that we can’t charge the president with obstruction of Congress for refusing all subpoenas as long as he has any fanciful claim until the courts reject those fanciful claims.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you. Professor Carlin, I’ll give you a chance to respond if you would like as well to the same question.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Yeah. Go ahead.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Professor Feldman, if Washington were here today, if he were joined by Madison and Hamilton and other framers, what do you believe they would say if presented with the evidence before us about President Trump’s conduct?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And they would find obstruction of justice, obstruction Congress and abusive power or some of them?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you. I’ll yield back the balance of my time on that. Recognize the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins for five minutes for questioning the witnesses.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentleman yields back. I now recognize Ms. Lofgren for five minutes.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	No objections.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentle lady yields back. Gentle lady yields back. We are expecting votes on the House floor shortly, so we will recess until immediately after the conclusion of those votes. I ask everyone in the room to please remain seated and quiet while the witnesses exit the room. I want to remind members of the audience that you may not be guaranteed your seat if you leave the hearing room at this time.  Questioning Part 2

2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Oh. Let me repeat that. The committee will come to order. When we broke for recess, we were under the five minute rule and I recognize Mr. Sensenbrenner For five minutes to question the witnesses.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Time of the gentlemen is expired. Gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman for yielding. Professor Gerhardt said, “If what we are talking about today is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable.” I’m reminded of my time on the house judiciary committee during the 1990s impeachment and as well a number of federal judges. I was guided then, not only by the facts, but by the constitution and the duty to serve this nation. I believe as we greet you today, that we are charged with a sober and somber responsibility. So professor Karlan, I’d like you to look at the intelligence volume where hundreds of documents are behind that in the Mueller report. Professor Karlan, and you studied the record. Do you think it is, “Wafer thin”? And can you remark on the strength of the record before us?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentlelady yields back. Mr. Chabot is recognized.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentleman’s, time has expired. Mr Goldman.

2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And we’ll consider the unanimous consent requests later after we’ve reviewed the material.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Thank you, gentleman. You may continue.

2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentleman yields back. In a moment, we will recess for a brief five minutes. First, I ask everyone in the room to please remain seated and quiet while the witnesses exit the room. I also want to remind those in the audience that you may not be guaranteed your seat if you leave the hearing room at this time. This time, the committee will stand in a short recess.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman yields back. A little while ago, Mr. Gates asked that certain material be inserted into the record by anonymous consent. I asked an opportunity to review it. We have reviewed it. The material will be inserted without objection. Mr. Lieu.

2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman yields back. And I want to before my closing statement acknowledge that I received a letter today requesting a minority day of testimony under rule 11. I have not had a chance to read the letter, but look forward to conferring with the ranking member about this request after I have had a chance to review it.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentlemen is not recognized.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And I recognize myself for a closing statement. George Washington’s farewell address warns of a moment when cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to serve for themselves the reins of government. President Trump placed his own personal and political interests above our national interests, above the security of our country, and most importantly, above our most precious right, the ability of each and every one of us to participate in fair elections, free of corruption. The Constitution has a solution for a president who places his personal or political interests above those of the nation, the power of impeachment.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	As one of my colleagues pointed out, I have in the past articulated a three part test for impeachment. Let me be clear. All three parts of that test have been met. First, yes, the president has committed an impeachable offense. The president asks the foreign government to intervene in our elections, then got caught, then obstructed the investigators, twice. Our witnesses told us in no uncertain terms that this conduct constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors, including abuse of power. Second, yes, the president’s alleged offenses represent a direct threat to the constitutional order. Professor Karlan warned drawing a foreign government into our election process is an especially serious abuse of power, because it undermines democracy itself. Professor Feldman echoed if we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy. We live in a monarchy or under a dictatorship, and Professor Gerhardt reminded us if what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable. President Trump’s actions represent the threat to our national security and an urgent threat to the integrity of the next election.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Third, yes, we should not proceed unless at least some of the citizens who supported the president in the last election are willing to come with us. A majority of this country is clearly prepared to impeach and remove President Trump.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Rather than respond to the unsettling and dangerous evidence my Republican colleagues have called this process unfair. It is not, nor is this argument new. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, unable to defend the behavior of the president, have used this argument before. First, they said that these proceedings were not constitutional because we did not have a floor vote. We then had a floor vote. Then they said that our proceedings were not constitutional because they could not call witnesses. Republicans called three of the witnesses in the live hearings of the Intelligence Committee and will have an opportunity to request witnesses in this committee as well.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Next, they said that our proceedings were not constitutional because the president could not participate. But when the committee invited the president to participate in this hearing, he declined. The simple fact is that all these proceedings have all the protections afforded prior presidents. This process follows the constitutional and legal precedence.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	So I am left to conclude that the only reason that my colleagues rushed from one process complaint to the next is because there is no factual defense for President Trump. Unlike any other president before him, President Trump has openly rejected Congress’s right as a coequal branch of government. He has defied our subpoenas. He has refused to produce any documents and he directed his aides not to testify. President Trump has also asked a foreign government to intervene in our elections and he has made clear that if left unchecked, he will do it again. Why? Because he believes that in his own words, “I can do whatever I want.” That is why we must act now. In this country, the president cannot do whatever he wants. In this country, no one, not even the president, is above the law.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Today we began our conversation where we should with the text of the Constitution. We have heard clearly from our witnesses that the Constitution compels action. Indeed, every witness, including the witness selected by the Republican side, agreed that if President Trump did what the Intelligence Committee found him to have done after extensive and compelling witnesses from the Trump administration officials, he committed impeachable offenses. While the Republican witness may not be convinced that there is sufficient evidence that the president engaged in these acts, the American people and the majority of this committee disagree.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I also think that the Republican witness, Professor Turley, issued a sage warning in 1998 when he was a leading advocate for the impeachment of Bill Clinton. He said, “If you decide that certain acts do not rise to impeachable offenses, you will expand the space for executive conduct.” That was the question of Professor Turley in 1998 in the impeachment of President Clinton. That question should guide us all today. And by any account that warning is infinitely more applicable to the abuses of power we are contemplating today, because as we all know, if these abuses go unchecked, they will only continue and only grow worse. Each of us took an oath to defend the Constitution. The president is a continuing threat to that Constitution and to our democracy. I will honor my oath and as I sit here today having heard consistent, clear and compelling evidence that the president has abused his power, attempted to undermine the constitutional role of Congress and corrupted our elections,. I urge my colleagues stand behind the oath you have taken. Our democracy depends on it. This concludes today’s hearing.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	What purpose does the gentlemen seek recognition?
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Noted. This concludes today’s hear-
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	This concludes today’s hearing.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	We thank all of our witnesses for partitioning.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Without objection…
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	… all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions-
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	… for the witnesses or additional-
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Too late.
2019-12-04	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The witnesses or additional materials for the record. Without objection, the hearing is a journey typical.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	We are conducting this hearing on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump. Presentations from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Judiciary Committee pursuant to House Resolution 660 and the special Judiciary Committee procedures that are described in section 4A of that resolution.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing, I will make an opening statement and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement. After that, we will hear two sets of presentations. We will hear 30 minute opening arguments from counsels for the majority and the minority-
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Order in the room. Order in the room.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Order in the committee room.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The committee will come to order. Obviously, I shouldn’t have to remind everyone present that the audience is here to observe but not to demonstrate, not to indicate agreement or disagreement with any witness or with any member of the committee. The audience is here to observe only and we will maintain decorum in the hearing room.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And again I will say here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing, I will make an opening statement and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement. After that, we will hear two sets of presentations. We will hear 30 minute opening arguments from counsels for the majority and the minority of this committee. Then we will hear 45 minute presentations of evidence from majority and minority counsel from the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Followed by 45 minutes of questioning by the chair and ranking member who may yield to counsel for questioning during this period.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Finally, all of our members will have the opportunity to question the presenters from the Intelligence Committee under the five minute rule. I would note that the president’s counsel was given the opportunity to participate today, but the White House as declined the invitation. I will now recognize myself for an opening statement.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	No matter his party or his politics, if the president places his own interests above those of the country, he betrays his oath of office. The president of the United States, the speaker of the house, the majority leader of the Senate, the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the chairman and ranking members of the House Committee on the Judiciary all have one important thing in common. We have each taken an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	If the president puts himself before the country, he violates the president’s most basic responsibility, he breaks his oath to the American people. If he puts himself before the country in a manner that threatens our democracy, then our oath, our promise to the American people requires us to come to the defense of the nation. That oath stands even when it is politically inconvenient, even when it might bring us under criticism, even when it might cost us our jobs as members of Congress, and even if the president is unwilling to honor his oath, I am compelled to honor mine.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	As we heard in our last hearing, the framers of the Constitution were careful students of history and clear in their vision for the new nation. They knew that threats to democracy can take many forms, that we must protect against them. They warned us against the dangers of would be monarchs, fake populace, and charismatic demigods. They knew that the most dangerous threat to our country might come from within in the form of a corrupt executive who put his private interests above the interests of the nation.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	They also knew that they could not anticipate every threat a president might someday pose, so they adopted the phrase treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors to capture the full spectrum of possible presidential misconduct. George Mason, who proposed this standard, said that, “It was meant to capture all manner of great and dangerous offenses against the Constitution.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The debates around the framing made clear that the most serious of such offenses include abuse of power, betrayal of the nation through foreign entanglements and corruption of public office. Any one of these violations of the public trust would compel the members of this committee to take action. When combined in a single course of action, they state the strongest possible case for impeachment and removal from office. President Trump put himself before country.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Despite the political partisanship that seems to punctuate our hearings these days, I believe that there is common ground around some of these ideas, common ground in this hearing room and common grounds across the country at large. We agree, for example, that impeachment is a solemn, serious undertaking. We agree that it is meant to address serious threats to democratic institutions like our free and fair elections. We agree that when the elections themselves are threatened by enemies, foreign or domestic, we cannot wait until the next election to address the threat. We surely agree that no public official, including and especially the president of the United States should use his public office for private gain. And we agree that no president may put himself before the country, the Constitution and his oath of office. This promise to America’s citizens require the president to put the country first.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	If we could drop our blinders for just one moment, I think we would agree on a common set of facts as well. On July 25th, President Trump called President Zelenskyi of Ukraine and asked him for a favor. That call was part of a concerted effort by President Trump to compel the government of Ukraine to announce an investigation, not an investigation of corruption at writ large, but an investigation of President Trump’s political rivals and only his political rivals. President Trump put himself before country.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The record shows that President Trump withheld military aid allocated by the United States Congress from Ukraine. It also shows that he withheld a White House meeting from President Zelenskyi. Multiple witnesses, including respected diplomats, national security professionals and decorated war veterans all testified to the same basic fact, President Trump withheld the aid and the meeting in order to pressure a foreign government to do him that favor. President Trump put himself before country. And when the president got caught, when Congress discovered that the aid has been withheld from Ukraine, the president took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to conceal evidence from Congress and from the American people. These facts are not in dispute. In fact, most of the arguments about these facts appear to be beside the point.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	As we review the evidence today, I expect we will hear much about the whistleblower who brought his concerns about the July 25th call to the inspector general of the intelligence community. Let me be clear. Every fact alleged by the whistleblower has been substantiated by multiple witnesses again and again, each of whom has been questioned extensively by Democrats and Republicans alike. The allegations also match up with the president’s own words as released by the White House. Words that he still says we’re, “perfect.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I also expect to hear complaints about the term quid pro quo, as if a person needs to verbally acknowledge the name of a crime while he is committing it for it to be a crime at all. The record on this point is also clear. Multiple officials testified that the president’s demand for an investigation into his rivals was a part of his personal political agenda and not related to the foreign policy objectives of the United States. Multiple officials testified that the president intended to withhold the aid until Ukraine announced the investigations. And yes, multiple officials testified that they understood this arrangement to be a quid pro quo for the president’s personal political benefit. President Trump put himself before country.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The president’s supporters are going to argue that this whole process is unfair. The record before us is clear on this point as well. We invited the president to participate in this hearing, to question witnesses and to present evidence that might explain the charges against him. President Trump chose not to show. He may not have much to say in his own defense, but he cannot claim that he did not have an opportunity to be heard.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Finally, as we proceed today, we will hear a great deal about the speed with which the House is addressing the president’s actions. To the members of the committee, to the members of the house and to my fellow citizens, I want to be absolutely clear, the integrity of our next election is at stake. Nothing could be more urgent. The president welcomed foreign interference in our elections in 2016. He demanded it for 2020. Then he got caught. If you do not believe that he will do it again, let me remind you that the president’s personal lawyer spent last week back in Ukraine meeting with government officials in an apparent attempt to gin up the same so-called favors that brought us here today and forced Congress to consider the impeachment of a sitting president. This pattern of conduct represents a continuing risk to the country.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The evidence shows that Donald J. Trump, the president of the United States, has put himself before his country. He has violated his most basic responsibilities to the people. He has broken his oath. I will honor mine. If you would honor yours, then I would urge you to do your duty. Let us review the record here in full view of the American people and then let us move swiftly to defend our country. We promised that we would.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I now recognize the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee-
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	… the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins-
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	… and his opening statement.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman from Georgia is recognized.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman from Georgia is recognized. [inaudible 00:11:28]. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman from Georgia is recognized. We’ll entertain that later.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman from Georgia is recognized.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Point of order, the gentleman will state his point of order.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	That is not a proper point of order in today’s hearing. As I have told the ranking member several times now, I am considering the minority’s request.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentlemen will suspend. If the ranking member thinks we would be violating the rules of the House if we considered articles of impeachment before holding a minority day hearing, his point of order would be timely at a meeting where we considered articles of impeachment. That is not the purpose of today’s hearing and the point of order is not timely. The gentleman from Georgia.  Doug Collins Opening Statement
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, you may begin.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The committee will reconvene when we recess. We’re about to hear from Mr. Caster. Mr. Caster, you are recognized for 45 minutes.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman’s time has expired. We will now proceed to the first round of questions.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentleman will state his point of order.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentleman will state a point of order.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	It’s not a point of order. Pursuant to House Resolution 660 and it’s accompanying judiciary committee procedures, there’ll be 45 minutes of questions conducted by the chairman, or majority council, followed by 45 minutes by the ranking member, or minority council. Only the chair and ranking member, and their respective councils, may question witnesses during this period. Following that, unless I specify additional equal time for extending questioning, we will proceed under the five minute rule, and every member will have the chance to ask questions. I now recognize myself for the first round of questions. The Republican’s expert witness last week, Professor Turley, wrote in an article that, quote, “There is no question that the use of public office for personal gain is an impeachable offense, including the withholding of military aid in exchange for the investigation of a political opponent. You just have to prove it happened.” Close quote. That was Mr. Turley’s comment. Now Mr. Goldman, did the investigative committees conclude that the evidence proved that the president used his public office for personal gain?
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And in fact, finding of fact five said, “President Trump used the power of the office of the president to apply increasing pressure on the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government to announce the politically motivated investigations desired by President Trump.” And did the evidence also prove that President Trump withheld military aid in exchange for an announcement of an investigation of his political opponent?
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	In fact-finding of fact 5B said, quote, “President Trump, acting through his agents and subordinates, conditioned release of the vital military assistance he has suspended to Ukraine on the president of Ukraine’s public announcement of the investigations that President Trump sought.” And did the evidence demonstrate that President Trump undermined the national security interests of the United States?
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And finding of fact six said, “In directing and orchestrating this scheme to advance his personal political interests, President Trump did not implement, promote, or advance U.S. anti-corruption policies. In fact, the president sought to pressure and induce the government of Ukraine to announce politically motivated investigations, lacking legitimate predication that the U.S. government otherwise discourages and opposes, as a matter of policy in that country in and around the world. In so doing, the present undermined U.S. policy supporting anti-corruption reform and the rule of law in Ukraine, and undermined U S national security.” And did the evidence also show that President Trump compromised the national security of the United States?
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	In fact-finding of fact seven said, “By withholding vital military assistance and diplomatic support from a strategic foreign partner government engaged in an ongoing military conflict illegally instigated by Russia, President Trump compromised national security to advance his personal political interests.” And did the evidence prove that President Trump engaged in a scheme to cover up his conduct and obstruct congressional investigators?
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And in fact-finding of fact nine says, “Using the power of the office of the president and exercising his authority over the executive branch, President Trump ordered and implemented a campaign to conceal his conduct for the public and frustrate and obstruct the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry.” Finally, the constitutional scholars from our hearing last week testified that the president’s conduct toward Ukraine, and pattern of inviting foreign election interference was a continuing risk to our free and fair elections. Did the evidence prove that President Trump was a threat to our elections?
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And in fact-finding of fact eight says, “Faced with a revelation of his actions, President Trump publicly and repeatedly persisted in urging foreign governments, including Ukraine and China, to investigate his political opponent. This continued solicitation of foreign interference in a U.S. election presents a clear and present danger that the president will continue to use the power of his office for his personal political gain.” Close quote. I would add, in the next election. I now yield to my counsel, Mr. Berke, for additional questioning.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Use your mic please.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The Gentleman is not recognized for parliamentary inquiry.

It’s going to be a close call. We’ll see.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I will further announced that I’m not prepared to say anything further about the schedule of the committee beyond today’s hearing.

2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	That’s not a recognizable point of order.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Point of order regarding the schedule? There is no point of order regarding the schedule.

2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	No. The genlady Mrs. Dean is recognized.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Mr. Goldman. Some have argued that we should wait, that we’re moving too fast, that we should try to get more evidence. Let’s examine why these arguments are without merit.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	President Nixon stated during the Senate Watergate investigation, quote, “all members of the white house staff will appear voluntarily when requested by the committee. They will testify under oath, and they will answer fully all proper questions,” end quote.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	During the investigation of President Clinton, Ken Starr interviewed White House staff. President Clinton also provided written responses to 81 interrogatories from the House Judiciary Committee.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Unlike his predecessors, President Trump has categorically stonewalled Congress’s investigation at every turn. Indeed, as far back as April, the President expressed his intent to stonewall.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	More recently on October the 8th, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone echoed this sentiment in a letter reflecting the President’s instruction that all executive branch officials not testify in this impeachment inquiry. Are you aware of that letter, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And Mr. Goldman, is it fair to say that President Trump is the only president in the history of our country to seek to completely obstruct an impeachment inquiry undertaken by this house?
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Genlady yields back. I yield to Ms. Jackson Lee for a unanimous consent request.

2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I recognize Mr. Jordan for the purpose of unanimous consent request.

2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Gentle lady yields back.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	This concludes the five minute round of questioning. I now recognize Mr. Raskin for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I now recognize myself for concluding remarks. After hearing the reports and the evidence today, we now know several things with certainty. We know that the president was at the center of a scheme to pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation of the president’s political rivals. He applied that pressure by withholding both a White House meeting and vital military aid. He made that demand directly to President Zelensky and confirmed his personal involvement on the White House lawn. We know that there are no excuses for this conduct. It is no excuse that President Trump eventually released the aid after his scheme was revealed to the public. And there is no excuse that he insisted that there was no quid pro quo only after his scheme was revealed to the public.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	We know that his actions endangered our a national security, putting our alliances, our reputation, and our safety at risk. We know that the president also compromise the integrity of elections for a corrupt private political purpose. We know that President Trump in an unprecedented act of obstruction ordered everybody in the executive branch to defy all congressional subpoenas for documents and subpoenas related to the impeachment inquiry.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	And we know that his attempts to solicit a political favor from the government of Ukraine fit a pattern of conduct that the president established in 2016 when he solicited political assistance from the government of Russia. That pattern of misconduct undermines our national security and undermines free and fair elections. In abusing his office in this manner and in obstructing the investigation that followed, we know that President Trump has put himself before his country.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	I am struck by the fact that my Republican colleagues have offered no serious scrutiny of the evidence at hand. They have talked about everything else, but they have offered not one substantive word in the President’s defense. I suspect that is because there is at base, no real defense for the President’s actions. President Trump put himself before his country.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	There is a constitutional remedy for a president who undermines our national security and our elections, who puts his own interests before those are the country. That remedy is impeachment. The facts are clear. The danger to our democracy is clear and our duty is clear. President Trump violated his oath to the American people. He placed his own private interests ahead of our national security and the integrity of our elections and constitutes a continuing threat to the integrity of our elections and to our democratic system of government. Such conduct is clearly impeachable. This committee will proceed accordingly.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	This concludes today’s hearing. We thank all of our presenters for participating. Without objection all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the presenters or additional materials for the record. Without objection, the hearing is adjourned.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Order in the room.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	Order in the committee room.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The president’s supporters are going to argue that this whole process is unfair. The record before us is clear at this point as well. We invited the president to participate in this hearing, to question witnesses and to present evidence that might explain the charges against him. President Trump chose not to show.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman will suspend. The time is the questioner’s and he can ask the questions of whoever he wants. When you question you’ll have the same rules.
2019-12-09	Jerry Nadler	D-Nadler	Democrat	The gentleman does not have the time and the gentleman has been warned before. You cannot simply yell out and disrupt the committee. The gentleman, Mr. Collins says the time.
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Hill and Mr. Holmes, thank you for your testimony. Dr. Hill, you made a fairly dramatic comment in your opening statement to which the ranking member took some exception. I?m more interested in the Ukraine piece of this, but you said some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and it?s security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason Ukraine did. I?m really much more interested in the Ukraine piece of this, but I do want to defend you briefly. I don?t know what my colleagues believe, but I do have a pretty good sense of what the effects are of creating ambiguity, of lacking clarity and conviction around the Russian attack on the election of 2016. In response to your comment, the ranking member offered up a report which varies in material respects from the report that was created by the 17 agencies of the intelligence community. A day does not go by in which ranking member Nunes does not speak of the Russia hoax. And this is an area in which context is pretty important.
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Dr. Hill, let me read you a comment by another senior official. ?Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against tax? It?s all a BIG DEM HOAX. All caps. Why did the DNC refused to turn over its server to the FBI? It?s all a Big Dem scam.? Dr. Hill, do you know who said those things?
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	That?s the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. So you might be forgiven for your-
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	You didn?t miss much. But my point is, and tell me if you agree or disagree, ambiguity, a failure to name and shame the Russians for the attack in 2016, that is not in the service of our national security, is it?
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	It?s not. So let?s turn to Ukraine. Dr. Hill, you characterize the idea that Ukraine interfered in the election as a fictional narrative, have you seen any evidence at all that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election?
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	May I interrupt you there? Let me be very specific about what those comments were. The president, when he was a candidate said quote, ?The people of Crimea, from what I?ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.? So Ambassador Charlie is responding to that in that article, correct?
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Right. So here it is.
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Let me just read, because it?s worth people hearing what this severe attack on candidate Trump, who is suggested that the Crimeans would rather be with Russia. Ambassador Charlie writes, ?Even if Trump?s comments are only speculative and do not really reflect a future foreign policy, they call for appeasement of an aggressor and support the violation of a sovereign country?s territorial integrity and another?s breach of international law.? That the attack on candidate Trump.
2019-11-21	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Does that sound like election interference to you?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Ambassador, thank you for your testimony today. Those of us who sit up here are supposed to be dispassionate and judicial and measured, but I’m angry and I’ve been angry since I learned about your summary, an unexplained dismissal after a lifetime of excellent and faithful service to this country. I’m angry that a woman whose family fled communism and Nazi-ism who served this country beautifully for 33 years, not in Paris or in Rome, but literally under fire in places like Mogadishu and Kyiv. I’m angry that a woman like you would be not just dismissed but humiliated and attacked by the president of the United States. I’m not just angry for you. I’m angry for every single foreign service officer, for every single military officer, for every intelligence officer who right now might believe that a lifetime of service and sacrifice and excellent might be ignored by the president of the United States, or worse yet, attacked in language that would embarrass a mob boss.
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Now it’s the president’s defense and it’s emerging from my Republican colleagues today that this is all okay because as the president so memorably put it in his tweet this morning, it is a US president’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors. I’m a little troubled by this idea of an absolute right because that doesn’t feel to me like the system of government we have here. I think that how and why we exercise our powers and rights matters. Ambassador, when you’re ambassador somewhere, do you have the right to ask the intelligence community, the CIA in an embassy what operations they’re doing?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	So you have the right to ask the intelligence community in your embassy what they’re doing. Why might you do that?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Right, so the performance of your duties in the interests of the United States gives you the right to ask very sensitive questions of our intelligence community in your embassy. But what if instead of working through the issues that you just described, you went to dinner that night and handed over that information to a Russian agent for $10,000. Would that be an appropriate exercise of your right?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	It would not. And what would happen to you if you did that?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Right. And this is not about ambassadors, right? A police officer has the right to pull you over. But if the police officer pulls over his ex-wife because he’s angry, that’s probably not right. I have the right … In fact, today I cast a bunch of votes, but if I cast those vote, not in the interest of my constituents but because somebody bribed me, that is a severe abuse of my power. Wouldn’t you agree?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	So I guess the question is why after an exemplary performance as ambassador to Ukraine did the president decide that you should be removed? Because I think we just agreed that if that was not done in the national interest, that’s a problem. Ambassador, if you had remained ambassador to Ukraine, would you have recommended to the president of the United States that he asked the new Ukrainian president to investigate, and I’m quoting from the transcript here, CrowdStrike or the server?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Okay. So ambassador, if you had remained as ambassador and not been summarily dismissed, would you have supported a three-month delay in congressionally mandated military aid to Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Ambassador, if you had remained as ambassador of Ukraine, would you have recommended to the president that he asked a new president of Ukraine to quote, “Find out about Biden’s son”?
0201-11-15	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	I have no more questions. I yield back to balance my time.
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you gentlemen for your testimony today. President Trump has described his July 25th phone call with President Zelensky as quote perfect, and I think he’s done that on Twitter, not once, not twice, but by my count 11 times. It feels to me like this characterization of perfect is of a piece with the idea that we hear in defense of the president’s request to the Ukrainians, that that’s just normal course of business pursuing anti-corruption, and I’ve been concerned from the start that this is actually not about going after corruption, it is in fact about aiming corruption at the vice president. Mr. Morrison, you listened in on the call in the White House Situation Room. Did you hear the president mention the company CrowdStrike and the server?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Did you hear President Trump mentioned the Bidens?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Did you hear President Trump in the length of that phone call use the word corruption?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Was the request that Ukraine investigate CrowdStrike and the Bidens consistent with what you understood to be official US policy towards combating corruption in Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	In fact, in your deposition, you testified that you wanted to stay away from what you described as this quote, bucket of investigations. Why did you want to stay away from those issues?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	You also testified that the president’s call was not, and I’m quoting you here, the full-throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda that I was hoping to hear. What did you mean by that?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	But that didn’t come up in the call, did it?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Are you aware of any other discussion in which the president actually raised those things with the new Ukrainian president?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Yes.
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Okay. Switching gears a little bit, you strike me as a process guy, and it’s nagging at me because you characterized Ambassador Sondland’s linking in whatever way it happened of aid to an investigation as The Gordon Problem. You said it caused you to roll your eyes. Ambassador Volker said in the July 10th meeting thought it was inappropriate. John Bolton characterizes this as the drug deal, so it seems like everybody in the room understands that there’s a huge problem here. My understanding is that it would be normal course of business when you have an ambassador out there going rogue as apparently there was consensus Ambassador Sondland was doing, that either the National Security Advisor, John Bolton, or the Secretary of State might reign them in. Why didn’t that happen?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	You don’t have any idea, you worked for him, you don’t have any idea why John Bolton would characterize what the ambassador was doing as a drug deal, but not reign him in?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	No, but John Bolton’s National Security Advisor, he presumably spends time with the Secretary of State. I’m just puzzled that everybody in the room is characterizing this as The Gordon Problem or inappropriate or a drug deal. And the Secretary of State does nothing.
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Well, yeah, just, you don’t have any insight into that?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Ambassador Volker, you testified that you were troubled once you read the record of the president’s July 25th call, you testified quote that asking the president of Ukraine to work together with the attorney general to look into this, you can see as it now has happened, this becomes explosive in our domestic politics. And in your new testimony, you call this unacceptable. What specifically in that call to the Ukraine president do you find unacceptable or troubling?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Thank you. I yield back the balance my time.
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Thank you both for your testimony. Ms. Williams, you joined the foreign service in 2006, correct?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Prior to becoming a nonpartisan career official, you worked as a field representative for the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004, and then you held a political appointment in the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Chertoff. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	And now as a foreign service officer, you have served three presidents, two Republicans and one Democrat, in a variety of roles, correct?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	And in your current position, you’re detailed from state to advise the Vice President on foreign policy towards Europe and Russia, correct?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Ms. Williams, on Sunday, the President personally targeted you in a tweet. This is after he targeted Ambassador Yovanovitch during her hearing testimony. I’d like to show and read you the tweet. It reads, “Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read both transcripts of the presidential calls and see the just-release statement from Ukraine. Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know and mostly never even heard of, and work out a better presidential attack.
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Ms. Williams, are you engaged in a presidential attack?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Ms. Williams, are you a Never Trumper?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Would you describe yourself that way?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Did that tweet make an impression on you when you read it?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Which surprised me, too, and it looks an awful lot like witness intimidation and tampering, and an effort to try to get you to perhaps shape your testimony today.
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Lieutenant Colonel, you previously testified that you’ve dedicated your entire professional life to the United States of America. Colonel, above your left breast, you are wearing a device which is a Springfield musket on a blue field. What is that device?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	How do you get the combat infantry men’s badge?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Under fire.
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	You’re also wearing a Purple Heart. Can you tell us in 20 or 30 seconds why you’re wearing a Purple Heart?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Were you injured?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	The day after you appeared for your deposition, Lieutenant Colonel, President Trump called you a Never Trumper. Colonel Vindman, would you call yourself a Never Trumper?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Thank you. Colonel Vindman, in your military career, you’ve served under four presidents, two Democrats and two Republicans. Have you ever wavered from the oath you took to support and defend the constitution?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Do you have any political motivations for your appearance here today?
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Colonel Vindman, multiple right wing conspiracy theorists, including Rudy Giuliani, have accused you of harboring loyalty towards Ukraine. They make these accusations based only on the fact that your family, like many American families, immigrated to the United States. They’ve accused you of espionage and dual loyalties. We’ve seen that in this room this morning.
0201-11-19	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	The three minutes that were spent asking you about the offer made to make you the Minister of Defense, that may have come cloaked in a Brooks brothers suit and in parliamentary language, but that was designed exclusively to give the right wing media an opening to question your loyalties. And I want people to understand what that was all about. It’s the kind of thing you say when you’re defending the indefensible. It’s what you say when it’s not enough to attack the media the way the ranking member gave over his opening statement, or to attack the Democrats. But it’s what you stoop to when the indefensibility of your case requires that you attack a man who is wearing a Springfield rifle on a field of blue above a Purple Heart. I, sir, thank you for your service, and yield back the balance of my time.
2019-11-13	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Gentlemen, thank you for your testimony today. One of the things I find startling about these proceedings is that faced with very serious allegations of presidential misconduct, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don’t engage or defend that conduct. Rather they spin theories about black ledgers, and Steele dossiers and the startling revelation that Ukrainians might have been upset when a presidential candidate suggested that perhaps he would let the Russians keep Crimea. Or of course we get the attacks so epitomized by Mr. Nunez’s opening statement when he attacked Democrats, he attacked the media and most disgustingly attack the extraordinary men and women of the State Department and the FBI. When a defense does emerge it looks a little like this, Ukraine is a corrupt country and the President was just acting in a long line, a long tradition of actually trying to address corruption in Ukraine. Mr. Kent, you’ve worked on anti-corruption and rule of law efforts for much of your 27 year career, is that correct?
2019-11-13	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	So like most of us up here, I don’t have a good sense of what a real anti-corruption effort that we must engage in all over the world all the time, what that looks like. So let me ask you to just take a minute and just characterize for us what a real initiative, what a real program of anti-corruption might look like.
2019-11-13	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	So what I’m hearing there, Mr. Kent, is a very comprehensive effort. So let me read you President Trump’s own words to the Ukrainian President in their July 25th phone call. And I quote, “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.” Mr. Kent, when you hear those words, do you hear the President participating in or requesting a thoughtful and well calibrated anti-corruption program?
2019-11-13	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	And Mr. Kent and Mr. Taylor, the defenders of the President’s behavior have made a big deal out of the fact that Vice President Biden encouraged the Ukrainians to remove a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor, 2016 Mr. Shokin. And in fact, Senator Rand Paul on Sunday said, and I quote him, “They’re impeaching the President Trump for exactly the same thing that Joe Biden did.” Is that correct? Is what the President did in his phone call and what Joe Biden did in terms of Mr. Shokin, are those exactly the same things? And if not, how are they different?
2019-11-13	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	So Joe Biden was participating in an open effort, establish whole of government effort to address corruption in Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Great. So, Mr. Kent, as you look at this whole mess, Rudy Giuliani, President Trump, in your opinion, was this a comprehensive and whole of government effort to end corruption in Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Exactly.
2019-11-13	Jim Himes	D-Himes	Democrat	Yeah, I don’t think President Trump was trying to end corruption in Ukraine. I think he was trying to aim corruption in Ukraine at Vice President Biden and at the 2020 election. And I yield back the balance of my time.
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Thank you Chairman, and thank you Ambassador for your 33 years of service to our nation. A big question here today is why you were pushed aside as Ambassador. For example, Americans know that an employer has a right to fire an employee, but they shouldn’t do it for certain reasons. You shouldn’t be fired because you’re disabled, because you’re a woman, because you’re black, and for other reasons. I think most Americans agree that a president shouldn’t fire an Ambassador or recall an ambassador because the Ambassador is standing in his way of doing a corrupt act.
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	So I want to ask you, did the President ever tell you why he was recalling you?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Did anybody at the White House ever tell you why you were being recalled?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Did the President ever consult you about who the good guys and the bad guys were in the Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Did Secretary Pompeo ever tell you why you were being recalled?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And it appears in the testimony that we’ve heard in the intelligence committee so far that there were a group of the President’s men, perhaps Secretary Perry, Rudy Giuliani, Ambassador Sondland, who were in on this scheme to help the President get the Biden’s and Burisma investigated. And I want to put aside President Trump for just a second and ask you, in all of your years of service have you ever come across a president, been asked by a president, or have known of colleagues who were asked by an American president to help that president get an American investigated overseas?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And if a president asked you to investigate a former vice president for this purpose, what would you have said?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And would you have considered it an unlawful act?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	But certainly it’s bizarre for a president to ask that some American be investigated by another government?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And also, you mentioned that there is corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine isn’t the only country that confronts corruption. If the people in power in a country where corruption is rampant are being asked by a foreign leader who’s got a lot of leverage over them to conduct an investigation, could that be dangerous because they could trump up charges against someone if they wanted?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And I also want to ask you … I spoke to Ambassador Kent. He made a comment yesterday about selective prosecutions and what it means going forward. What kind of precedent it sets. And you’ve spoken about a dangerous precedent for the State Department and for diplomats, but I want you to help us consider the precedent going forward. If there’s no consequences for President Trump, or really any president who does this, what are the consequences for this country and for any American? Not just a former vice president or a presidential candidate or even somebody in politics, but a person in business who does business in Saudi Arabia or some other country. If a president is going to speak to another head of state or some foreign official and try to get that person investigated, what does that mean for the future of the country and for Americans?
0201-11-15	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	I yield back to the Chairman.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Thank you, chairman. Thank you gentlemen, for your testimony today. Is it correct to say that both you gentlemen were either appointed or hired by the White House, by the Trump administration?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	But part of the Trump administration.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Sure. Ambassador Volker, you previously testified that Ambassador Gordon Sondland, “I just know that he had a relationship with President Trump that I did not have”. In fact, in one text message dated July 26th you wrote to Ambassador Sondland, “Great photo Gordon, can you get this to POTUS without intermediaries?”. July 26th was the same day that Ambassador Sondland spoke to the President from a restaurant in Kiev, is that right?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	July 26th.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Were you aware of that call?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Well this committee certainly is aware of it now as we all are. Were you aware that Ambassador Sondland had a direct line to the President?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Did you have reason to doubt that?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	But he too, he was a political appointee. He was handpicked by the President or somebody in the President’s administration to serve in his position.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	He had also been a large donor to one of President Trump’s campaign committees. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Mr. Morrison, you stated during your testimony that when you met Ambassador Sondland for the first time, he represented that, “His mandate from the President was to go make deals”. And in fact you testified that between July 25th and September 11th of this year, you heard or learned that Ambassador Sondland and President Trump spoke on several occasions. Is it accurate that every time you checked you were able to confirm that Ambassador Sondland had in fact spoken to the President?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Mr. Morrison, you also testified that Ambassador Sondland emailed you and several White House staff to say that he briefed President Trump in advance of his July 25th call with the Ukrainian president. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Did Ambassador Sondland and tell you what he briefed the President on?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And you testified that you personally confirmed that Ambassador Sondland and President Trump had spoken before the July 25th call.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And presumably the White House situation room keeps a record of those calls.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Okay. You separately testify that your staff prepared a briefing memo with suggested points for the President to raise on July 25th. Points that were consistent with U.S. policy, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	But the President didn’t use those points, did he?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	So I guess, let me get this straight. You prepared materials for the President, your materials did not include references to Biden or the 2016 election, is that right?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And then Ambassador Sondland, the guy who is the Gordon problem, the guy who’s got a direct link to the President, the guy who’s talking about making deals briefed President Trump, is that right?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And then President Trump raised the 2016 election, and Vice President Biden and his son to the Ukrainian president after he was briefed by Ambassador Sondland. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	It sounds like Ambassador Sondland and the President were on the same page. They both were working to benefit the President’s personal political interest even when that undermined U.S. foreign policy. I want to ask you in the short time that I have both you gentlemen who served the United States government, whether, putting President Trump aside, whether you believe that it’s proper for any president now or later to ask a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen, and specifically a U.S. citizen that could be a political rival. Ambassador?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Mr. Morrison?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Thank you chairman. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Thank you Chairman, Ms. Williams, thank you for your service to the country. Colonel Vindman, thank you for your service and it’s great to talk to a fellow identical twin. I hope that your brother’s nicer to you than mine is to me. It doesn’t make you grow a beard.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	You both listened in real time to the July 25th call. In particular, you would have heard president Trump asked the President of Ukraine quote, I’d like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike, end quote. The server, they say Ukraine has it. This is a debunk conspiracy theory that has no basis in fact. President Trump’s own former Homeland Security Advisor, Thomas P. Bossert, call the presence assertion that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 elections. Quote, not only a conspiracy theory, but quote unquote, completely debunked, unquote. Colonel Vindman, are you aware of any evidence to support the theory that the Ukrainian government interfered in the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And are you aware of any part of the U.S. Government, its foreign policy or intelligence apparatus that supports that theory?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	You are aware that other parts of the U.S. Government, our intelligence community, for example, has said definitively that it was the Russians who interfered in the 2016 elections?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	It seems incredibly odd though, unfortunately, but not inconsistent to me that President Trump would be giving credence to a conspiracy theory about Ukraine that helps Russia really in at least two ways. First, it ignores and frankly undermines the assessment of the U.S. Intelligence community and seeks to weaken a state dependent on the United States support to fight Russian aggression. It also, for the United States, hurts our national security and emboldens Russia. And I want to look at what President Trump was doing on his call instead of pushing back against Russian hostility.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	He was pressuring Ukraine to do his political work. President Trump’s state on that July 25th call quote, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me. Colonel Vindman, when you hear those words, do you hear the President requesting a thoughtful and well calibrated anti-corruption program consistent with U.S. Policy?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	In fact, it sounds like President Trump was encouraging the Ukrainian President to engage in precisely the same type of behavior for President Trump’s own political benefit that we discourage foreign leaders from undertaking in their own countries. And discouraging other countries from undertaking politically motivated investigation is in fact, a major part of official U.S. Anti corruption policy. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	And are you in fact aware of any evidence that Vice President Biden improperly interfered in investigation of his family members?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	These false narratives, it should be said, are damaging our country. They poison our politics and distract from the truth and pressing another country to engage in corruption is antithetical to who we are as a nation. You also mentioned that this request where you felt this request was wrong. And you’ve also said that corruption in Ukraine is endemic to Ukraine just as it is in other places around the world.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Can you speak to, what is the danger of a President of the United States, whether it’s Donald Trump or any future president asking another nation where there’s rampant corruption to investigate a political rival or just any other American citizen? What would be the danger to that American?
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	So they could Trump up charges if they wanted to, in a corrupt system like that.
0201-11-19	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Thank you.
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Thank you chairman. Thank you gentlemen for your testimony today and for your service to our country. Listening to all the evidence, everything I’ve heard and read in this investigation, it seems to me that the President of the United States either committed extortion and bribery of a foreign official or attempted extortion and bribery of a foreign official. When President Trump got President Zelensky on the phone on July 25th, he was talking to a desperate man, wasn’t he? President Zelensky was desperate to protect his country and make sure that he had foreign assistance from the United States. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	What would have happened if the aid had gotten cut off, ambassador? What would have happened to President Zelensky’s career, and what would’ve happened to the Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	The Russians may have taken it as an invitation to actually take military action against Ukraine, is that right?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	They could have pounced.
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	So he had a desperate man on the phone and he asked a desperate man for a favor. And based on your testimony, it sounds like begrudgingly President’s Zelensky may have actually agreed to do that favor and investigate the Bidens and Burisma. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	So we know that President Trump asked for a favor to help his political career, and it appears as though the president of the Ukraine agreed to that favor. Do we know why it didn’t actually happen?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Do we know why there was no announcement in front of CNN or to CNN about an investigation?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	So the hold was released. Is it possible that the White House released that hold because they knew that a whistle blower had basically turned this in?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Do you think that’s possible?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	So we have a president who the other side claimed or has defended the president saying that the aid went through, that there was never any investigation, but the president attempted to get those things done, and it looks like there was an initial agreement by the President of the Ukraine to actually do those things.
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	So, ambassadors, is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted murder a crime?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Is attempted robbery a crime?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	I think anybody in this room could answer that question.
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	Is attempted extortion and bribery a crime?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	In the minute that I have left, I want you to speak to the nation about what’s at stake, Ambassador Kent. You said in your opening statement, you warned about selective prosecutions and a president of the United States going after specific Americans abroad. If this Congress clears President Trump, does it mean that he can go ask another foreign country to investigate another presidential candidate, a member of Congress, a governor, a Senator, or any private American citizen doing business overseas? If there’s no consequence for a president who does that, then it means there’s a green light, doesn’t it? For any president to ask any country to go prosecute or investigate an American citizen for political and personal gain of that president, doesn’t it?
2019-11-13	Joaquin Castro	D-Castro	Democrat	I’m sorry, Deputy-
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professors, good morning.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Thank you for being here. I want to ask you some questions about the following high crimes and misdemeanors that were mentioned in the opening statements. Abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress, and obstruction of justice. Professor Feldman, what is abuse of power?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Sir, why is that impeachable conduct?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, do scholars of impeachment generally agree that abuse of power is an impeachable offense?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, do you agree that abuse of power is impeachable?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	I’d like to focus the panel on the evidence they considered and the findings in the Intelligence Committee report that the President solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. Professor Feldman, did President Trump commit the impeachable high crime and misdemeanor of abuse of power, based on that evidence and those findings?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, same question.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, did President Trump commit the impeachable high crime and misdemeanor of abuse of power?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Feldman, I’d like to quickly look at the evidence and the report. On July 25th, President Trump told the President of Ukraine, and I quote, “I would like you to do us a favor though,” and he asked about looking into the Bidens. Was the memorandum of that call relevant to your opinion that the President committed abuse of power?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Did you consider the findings of fact that the Intelligence Committee made including that, and again I quote, “The President withheld official acts of value to Ukraine, and conditioned their fulfillment on actions by Ukraine that would benefit his personal political interests”?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Sir, did you review the following testimony from our Ambassador to Ukraine, Ambassador William Taylor?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Feldman, will you please explain why you concluded that the President committed the high crime of abuse of power, and why it matters?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Now, Professor Karlan, this high crime and misdemeanor of abuse of power, was it some kind of loose or undefined concept to the Founders of our country and the Framers of our Constitution?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Can you share a little bit about that lineage, please?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Now, Professor Gerhardt, does a high crime and misdemeanor require an actual statutory crime?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Turley, you recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal and I quote, “There is much that is worthy of investigation in the Ukraine scandal, and it is true that impeachment doesn’t require a crime.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Sir, it was a “yes” or a “no” question. Did write in The Wall Street Journal, “There is much that is worthy of investigation in the Ukraine scandal, and it is true that impeachment does not require a crime”? Is that an accurate quote, sir?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professors Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt, you have identified that on the evidence here, there is an impeachable act, a high crime and misdemeanor of abuse of power, correct?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Feldman, what does the Constitution say is the responsibility of the House of Representatives in dealing with Presidential high crimes and misdemeanors like abuse of power?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, what does that responsibility mean for this Committee with respect to President Trump’s abuse of power?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, I’d like to direct you to the words in the Constitution, “Other high crimes and misdemeanors.” We’re still going to talk about abuse of power. Can I ask, did the Constitution spell out every other high crime and misdemeanor?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Why? Please, please.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor, in your written testimony, you mentioned two additional aspects of high crimes and misdemeanors besides abuse of power. You talked about betrayal of the national interest and corruption of the electoral process. Can you say a little bit more about what the Framers’ concerns were about corruption of elections and betrayal of the national interest involving foreign powers, and how they come into play here?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Feldman, anything to add?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Feldman, did you review the Intelligence Committee report finding that President Trump compromised national security to advance his personal political interests?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Will you explain, in your view, how that happened?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Sir, is it your view that the Framers would conclude that there was a betrayal of the national interest or national security by President Trump on these facts?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, what are your thoughts on the abuse of power, betrayal of national security or national interest, and the corruption of elections, sir?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, can you have an impeachable offense of abuse of power that is supported by considerations of a President’s betrayal of the national interest or national security, and by corruption of elections?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Do we have that here, ma’am?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Feldman, do you agree?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, we’ve been talking about the category of other high crimes and misdemeanors like abuse of power, but there are some additional high crimes and misdemeanors that are specifically identified in the text of the Constitution, correct?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	What are they?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Do President Trump’s demands on Ukraine also establish the high crime of bribery?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Can you explain why, please?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Thank you.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	And so, we have Constitutional bribery here, the high crime and misdemeanor of Constitutional bribery against President Trump.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	In forming that opinion, did you review the memorandum of the President’s telephone call with the Ukrainian President? The one where President Trump asked, “I would like you to do us a favor though,” and also asked about looking into his U.S. political opponents?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Did you consider the following testimony from our Ambassador to the European Union, Ambassador Sondland?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Did you consider that, Professor?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Did you also consider the findings of fact that the Intelligence Committee made including that, and I quote from finding of fact number five, “The President withheld official acts of value to Ukraine, and conditioned their fulfillment on actions by Ukraine that would benefit his personal political interests”?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Please talk about it.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Feldman, any thoughts on the subject of the high crime and misdemeanor of bribery and the evidence that Professor Karlan laid out?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, what is your view?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	What can this committee and the House of Representatives do, sir, to defend those boundaries and to protect against that erosion?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Does it matter? I’ll ask all the panelists. Does it matter to impeachment that the $391 million, US tax payer dollars, in military assistance that the president withheld was ultimately delivered? Professor Feldman, does that matter to the question of impeachment?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, does it matter to impeachment that the unfounded investigations the president sought were ultimately never announced?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	What’s the danger if Congress does not respond to that attempt?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, your view?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professors, we’ve talked about abuse of power and bribery. When we started, we said we would also discuss obstruction of Congress. So I’d like to ask you some questions about obstruction of Congress. Professor Gerhardt, in your view, is there enough evidence here to charge President Trump with the high crime and misdemeanor of obstruction of Congress?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, do you agree?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	We will accept your opinion as a citizen. Professor Feldman.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Sir, in forming your opinion, did you review these statements from President Trump?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, in forming your opinion that President Trump has committed the impeachable offense of obstruction of Congress, did you consider the Intelligence Committee report and its findings, including finding nine, that President Trump ordered and implemented a campaign to conceal his conduct from the public, and to frustrate and obstruct the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	So we’ve talked first about abuse of power and bribery, and then about obstruction of Congress. Professor Gerhardt, I’d like to now ask you some questions about a third impeachable offense, and that is obstruction of justice.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Sir, have you formed an opinion as to whether President Trump committed the impeachable offense of obstruction of justice?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	What is your opinion, sir?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	In your testimony, sir, you pointed out that the Mueller report found at least five instances of the president’s obstruction of the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, correct?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	The first of those instances was the president’s ordering his then White House counsel, Don McGahn, to fire the special counsel, rather to have the special counsel fired, in order to thwart the investigation of the president, correct?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	The second was the president ordering Mr. McGahn to create a false written record denying that the president had ordered him to have Mr. Mueller removed.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	You also point to the meeting of the president with his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, in order to get him to take steps to have the investigation curtailed, right?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	You also point to pardon dangling and witness tampering as to Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen, former campaign official, former personal lawyer of the president.
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	How serious is that evidence of obstruction of justice, sir?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Karlan, when you look at the Department of Justice Russia investigation and how the president responded to that, and when you look at Congress’ Ukraine investigation and how the president responded to that, do you see a pattern?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Professor Feldman, you were somewhat of an impeachment skeptic at the time of the release of the Mueller report, were you not?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	What’s changed for you, sir?
2019-12-04	Norm Eisen	D-Eisen	Democrat	Thank you. I yield my time back to the Chairman.
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Madam Ambassador. Madam Ambassador, returning to the topic of corruption, we heard evidence that you were successful at promoting efforts to address corruption. On Wednesday, in testifying about your very sterling career as a champion of anti corruption efforts in Ukraine, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent said, quote, “You can’t promote principled anti corruption action without pissing off corrupt people,” end quote.
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	It seems that your efforts as ambassador to essentially reform the powerful Prosecutor General’s office in Ukraine did exactly that. Madam Ambassador, what concerned you about the Prosecutor General’s office when you are the ambassador in Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Madam Ambassador, was the head of that office corrupt?
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	And you got the sense, did you not, that he was a driving force behind some of the attacks against you?
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Which ultimately led to your removal, correct?
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	But it wasn’t just him. His allegations were picked up and spread by Mr. Giuliani, and Donald Trump, Jr., were they not?
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	So let me get this straight. You were effective at fighting corruption in the Ukraine, fighting that corruption was important to the national security of the United States, and you were punished for that, ultimately being removed from your post by the President of the United States. So in your opinion, Madam Ambassador, why is it important to have a nonpartisan career in the foreign services?
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	And could you briefly describe for us what broad US policies you have sought to advance in your 33 years of service, and specifically in post-Soviet states like Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you for your service. I yield to the Chairman.
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you Chairman Schiff. Ambassador Volker, I want to focus on the press statement that President Trump and Rudy Giuliani wanted Ukraine to make announcing investigations to benefit President Trump. On August 9th sir, Ambassador Sondland and you had this exchange, Ambassador Sondlund says, “Morrison ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.” You reply, “Excellent! How did you sway him?” And Ambassador Sondland says, “Not sure I did. I think potus really wants the deliverable.” The deliverable here was a public announcement that Ukraine was going to conduct investigations into Burisma, and alleged 2016 legend interference by Ukraine. Is that correct, sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	On August 13th, you and Ambassador Sondland discussed a draft statement from Ukraine with Mr. Giuliani. Sir, why did you discuss the draft statement with Mr. Giuliani?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	So was Mr. Giuliani satisfied with this statement?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Why not?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	So in fact, Mr. Giuliani wanted a statement that referenced Burisma and the 2016 elections explicitly, one that would benefit essentially President Trump. Mr Ambassador, here’s the text you sent to the Ukrainian official on August 13th, let’s put that up on the screen. You said, “Hi Andrey. Good talking. Following is the text with an insert at the end for the two key items.” Mr. Ambassador, those two key items were specific references to investigations of Burisma, and the 2016 elections. Isn’t that right, sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Did Mr. Giuliani, sir, dictate those two key items to you, sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	And you included them in the proposal to the Ukrainians?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Ambassador, if you believe the statement that Mr. Giuliani dictated in August was not a good idea, sir, why were the Ukrainians still considering giving an interview with the same themes in September?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, sir. Mr. Morrison, you said that the president’s requests during the July 25th call were not consistent with US policy. I emphatically agree with you, sir. Yet these text messages show that Ambassador Volker spent much of August pressing Ukraine to meet those requests. We can only be grateful, I guess, if the president essentially got caught and Congress passed a law to ensure the funding was released in Ukraine before it was too late. I thank you both for your service. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Chairman Schiff. I yield to the Chairman.
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Chairman. Thank you both for your service. Colonel Vindman, you were in a July 10th White House meeting in Ambassador Bolton’s office, isn’t that right sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	You were in a July 10th White House meeting with Ambassador Bolton.
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	In that meeting, the Ukrainians ask about when they would get their oval office meeting and Ambassador Solomon replied that they need to “Speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure a meeting with the President.” Is that correct sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Colonel Vindman. Did you later learn why Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	After Ambassador Bolton ended that meeting, sir, some of the group that attended a follow on meeting in a different room in the White House called the Ward Room, is that correct, sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	And Ambassador Solomon was there with the senior Ukrainian officials, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Did NSC lawyers tell you to come directly to them, sir, if you had any other concerns after July 10th?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	And this follow on meeting, sir, Ambassador Solomon left. In your words, “No ambiguity,” about what specific investigations he was requesting. Ambassador Solomon made clear that he was requesting an investigation of Vice President, Joe Biden’s son. Isn’t that correct, sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	And you stated that he was asking these requests in coordination with the chief of staff, White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney? Correct, sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Colonel, in your career, had you ever before witnessed an American official requests that a foreign government investigate a US citizen who is related to the President’s political opponent?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	And Colonel, you immediately raised concerns about this, correct, sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	What exactly happened?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	You raised concerns about this, correct sir?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	What happened?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Did you also raise concern that day with White House lawyers?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	What did you tell them?
0201-11-19	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	As we are now aware sir, Ambassador Bolton expressed his concerns and instructed Dr. Fiona Hill, your supervisor, to also meet with the same White House lawyers to tell them what happened. Colonel Vindman, I agree that there is no question that Ambassador Solomon was proposing a transaction to Ukrainian officials trading White House meetings for specific investigations with the full awareness of the President’s chief of staff, White House attorneys, and his national security advisor. In my view, sir, that’s appalling. Thank you both for your service. I yield back to the chairman.
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, chairman. My colleague touched briefly on the campaign to remove career diplomat, Ambassador Yovanovitch. Mr. Kent, you stated in previous testimony that you were aware of the “campaign of slander” against the ambassador in real time, which basically unfolded in the media. Where do you understand this misinformation campaign was coming from and who was essentially perpetuating it?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	A corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor gave an interview to a reporter in the United States and made claims that the ambassador provided officials with a “do not prosecute” list. Sir, do you have any reason to believe this is true?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	What was the reputation of the man who made these allegations, sir?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	What was your experience with Ambassador Yovanovitch? Was she working hard to combat corruption in Ukraine, sir?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	So, in fact, before all of this happened, you and your superiors at the State Department asked the ambassador to extend her time in the Ukraine, correct, sir?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Did you support her extension?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Now some in Ukraine probably disliked her efforts to help Ukraine root out corruption. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Fair enough. Now, some of those people helped Giuliani smear her, did they not?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Ultimately that smear campaign pushed President Trump to remove her, correct, sir?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	So Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, in all of your combined decades at the State Department, have you ever before seen an instance where an ambassador was forced out by the president following a smear campaign of misinformation orchestrated by the president’s allies?
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
2019-11-13	Andre Carson	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you chairman. I yield to the chairman.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Feldman, let me begin with by stating the obvious. It is not hearsay when the president tells the president of Ukraine to investigate his political adversary, is it?
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	It is not hearsay when the president then confesses on national television to doing that, is it?
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	It is not hearsay when administration officials testify that they hear the president say he only cares about the investigations of his political opponent, is it?
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	And there’s lots of other direct evidence in this 300-page report from the intelligence committee. So let’s dispense with that claim by my Republican colleagues. Professor Turley notwithstanding what he said today, wrote an August 1st, 2014, in a piece called Five myths about impeachment. One of the myths he was rejecting was that impeachment required a criminal offense and he wrote, “An offense does not have to be indictable, serious misconduct or violation of public trust is enough.” Was Professor Turley right when he wrote that back in 2014?
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Now, next I’m going to move to Professor Karlan. At the constitutional convention, Elbridge Gerry said, “Foreign powers will intermeddle in our affairs and spear no expense to influence them.” And the response, James Madison said that impeachment was needed because otherwise a president “might betray his trust to a foreign power.” Professor Karlan, can you elaborate on why the framers were so concerned about foreign interference, how they accounted for these concerns and how that relates to the facts before this committee?
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Professor. There are three known instances of the president publicly asking a foreign country to interfere in our elections. First, in 2016, the president publicly hoped that Russia would hack into the email of a political opponent, which they subsequently did.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Second, based on the presence own summary of his call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, we know he asked Ukraine to announce an investigation of his chief political rival and used aid appropriated by Congress as leverage in his efforts to achieve this. And third, the president then publicly urge China to begin its own investigation.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Feldman, how would it impact our democracy if it became standard practice for the president of the United States to ask a foreign government to interfere in our elections?
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	I’d like to end with a powerful warning from George Washington who told Americans in his farewell address, “To be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most painful foes of Republican government.” The conduct at issue here is egregious and warrants a commensurate response. The president has openly and repeatedly solicited for an interference in our elections, of that, there is no doubt.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	This matters because inviting foreign meddling into our elections robs the American people have their sacred right to elect their own political leaders. Americans all across this country wait in long lines to exercise their right to vote and to choose their own leaders. This right does not belong to foreign governments. We fought and won a revolution over this. Free and fair elections are what separate us from authoritarians all over the world.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	As public servants and members of the house, we would be negligent in our duties under the constitution if we let this blatant abuse of power go unchecked. We’ve heard a lot about hating this president, it’s not about hating this president. It’s about our love of country. It’s about honoring the oath that we took to protect and defend the constitution of this great country.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	And so my final question is to Professor Feldman and to Professor Karlan, in the face of this evidence, what are the consequences if this committee and this Congress refuses to muster the courage to respond to this gross abuse of power that undermine the national security of the United States, that undermine the integrity of our elections, and that undermined the confidence that we have to have in the president to not abuse the power of his office?
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Karlan.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that a document which lists the 400 pieces of legislation passed by the house, 275 bipartisan bills, 80% which remain languishing in the setup you’ve made a part of the record in response to Mr. Gates claim that we’re not getting the work done.
2019-12-04	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Chairman may I have another unanimous consent?
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Let me begin by dispelling the claim that Mr. Gaetv just made. This has been one of the most productive congresses in modern history. We’ve passed nearly 400 pieces of legislation that respond to the urgent priorities of the American people driving down healthcare costs, raising wages for the American worker, responding to gun violence, providing equal pay for equal work, responding to the climate crisis. 275 of those bills are fully bi-partisan and 80% of those bills are sitting on the Senate majority leader’s desk awaiting action.
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	So we will continue to deliver on the important priorities of the American people. But we were also elected to hold this president accountable and we took an oath of office that said to protect and defend the constitution and that’s what we’re engaged in today. So I want to return Mr. Goldman to the military aide. Did the investigating committees receive evidence about why the United States military aid to Ukraine was necessary? What was it advancing? Because a lot of Americans who are watching don’t know a lot about Ukraine, don’t know about the geopolitical significance. Like why does it matter?
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	And prior to the call on July 25th Congress had approved the aid, correct?
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	And the Defense Department had even publicly announced its intention to deliver the aid, correct?
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	The Trump administration had already certified that Ukraine had taken substantial steps to combat corruption, correct?
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	And that normally leads to the release of the aid, that’s certification.
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	The investigative committees questioned witnesses from the Defense Department, the State Department, OMB, the White House and the National Security Council about the president’s decision to withhold aid, correct?
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	I’d like to play a clip of some of that evidence
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	I’m I correct that the witnesses that appeared before your committee confirmed that there was no credible explanation for withholding the military aid and that it was in fact against our national security interest to do so?
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	And as we heard from Bill Taylor, who is a graduate of West Point and a decorated combat veteran who served in Vietnam, Ukraine then and now is in an active war with the Russians. Russia stole part of their country in Crimea and has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainians and weakening Ukraine would only benefit Russia. Here’s what ambassador Taylor said.
2019-12-09	David Cicilline	D-Others	Democrat	Against the consensus of his own agencies and national security experts, the president used congressionally appropriated funds to advance his own political interests at the expense of our national security. This action is a threat to the integrity of our elections and the sanctity of our democracy. President Trump must not get away with this. No one in this country, no one, including the president of the United States is above the law and with that I yield back.
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you and thank you professors for your time today. It’s been a long day. I want to tell you, I did not have the privilege of being born into this country. As an immigrant, when I became a citizen to this great nation, I took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all foreign and domestic enemies and I had the fortune of taking that oath once again when I became a member of Congress. And that includes the responsibility to protect our nation from continuing threats from a president. Any president.
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	You testified that the president’s actions are a continuing risk to our nation and democracy, meaning that this is not a one time problem. There is a pattern of behavior by the president that is putting at risk fair and free elections, and I think that we are here today because the American people deserve to know whether we need to remove the president because of it.
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	During the Nixon impeachment, the judiciary committee said, “The purpose of impeachment is not personal punishment. It’s function is primarily to maintain constitutional government.” Professor Karlan, to me that means that impeachment should be used when we must protect our American democracy. It is reserved for offenses that present a continuing risk to our democracy. Is that correct?
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. And I want to show you an example of what the president said just one week after the transcript of the July 25th call was released. When a reporter asked the president what he wanted from President Zelensky and he responded with this.
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	So we’ve heard today conflicting dialogue from both sides. And I just want to ask Mr. Feldman, is this clear evidence from a president asking from for a foreign government to interfere in our elections?
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. And Professor Karlan, are the president’s actions a continuing risk that the framers intended impeachment to be used for?
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you and I want to show you one more example from the president’s chief of staff, when asked about the president, he meant of the Ukrainian president,
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Karlan.
2019-12-04	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. And I think that that is our greatest fear and threat and I don’t think that anyone is above the law. The constitution establishes that this type of behavior cannot be tolerated from any president, not now, not in the future. And I yield back.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	No.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Of course, no.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	I think that it isn’t possible for me to be on any of the boards that I just mentioned without saying I’m the son of the vice president of the United States.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably not.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Goldman, I want to come back and highlight what I think is the biggest national security threat, and that’s foreign interference into our elections. And I can tell you that in Florida, we’re extremely concerned about the security of our elections and the potential for election interference by foreign governments, especially Russia, because Florida, my home state was a victim of Russian hacking in 2016. And there’s every indication that they’re trying to do the same thing right now.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Our country was founded on the premise that our elected officials are elected by the people, but President Trump doesn’t share these ideas. He has and continues to demand foreign interference into our elections. He doesn’t want the American people to decide. He’s inviting foreign interference, allowing foreign governments to decide that for us.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, it’s been confirmed that President Trump’s campaign actively sought Russia’s interference in our 2016 elections, correct?
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Right. And in 2016 Trump said, “Russia, if you’re listening…”, and within five hours, Russian intelligence targeted the emails of Trump’s opponent. On October 3, 2019 when asked what he hoped President Zelensky would do about the Bidens, this is what President Trump said.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	And let me just point out, the President doesn’t mention corruption, does he, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Correct. And Trump is not only asking… President Trump, excuse me, is not only asking Ukraine, but he also says China should start investigating his political opponents. The President’s pattern of behavior is incredibly disturbing. Russia, Ukraine, China, he’s inviting three countries to help him in his reelection campaign. And Mr. Goldman, I don’t see any reason to believe he wouldn’t ask any other governments, for example, Venezuela, correct?
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Exactly. I mean we saw Giuliani in Ukraine just three days ago, and last night I want to point out that the Washington Post actually released an article saying that Rudy Giuliani has been now advising on how to open a back channel between President Trump and Maduro. So I’m very worried about that.
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Now I don’t think we have any time to wait to see if any countries are now going to take him up on the offer to help him in his reelection campaign. Mr. Goldman, did the investigative committees reach any conclusions about the ongoing threats, the continuing risk that the president poses?
2019-12-09	Debbie M. Powel	D-Others	Democrat	Exactly. I think the constitution demands that the President follow the rule of law and fight to keep our elections fair, free of corruption and free of Russian interference, excuse me, foreign interference. Now I know that I was elected by the people of Florida and I work only for the people of this country. I’m not going to let, while I’m in office, anyone interfere in our elections or threaten our democracy. The continuing pattern of behavior we’ve seen from this president should be a warning to the American people that it is a beginning of a dictatorship which I have seen in Latin America. I’ve witnessed men in office abuse the power inviting foreign interference and also obstructing any checks on their power. The constitution, the constitution has no partisan allegiance. We can not allow this behavior from this president or any future president. Our democracy depends on it.
2019-12-04	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and thank you to our outstanding witnesses here today. President Trump has declared that he will not comply with congressional subpoenas. This blanket categorical disregard of the legislative branch began with the president’s refusal to cooperate with regular congressional oversight and has now extended to the House’s constitutional duty on impeachment, the reason why we are here today. This disregard has been on display for the American people. When asked if he would comply with the Don McGahn subpoena, President Trump said, “Well, we’re fighting all the subpoenas.” Now we’ve discussed here today the obstruction of Congress article impeachment against president Nixon. I think I’d like to go a little bit deeper into that discussion and juxtapose it with the President Trump’s actions. Professor Gerhardt, can you elaborate on how President Nixon obstructed Congress and how it compares to President Trump’s actions?
2019-12-04	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Feldman, what are the consequences of this unprecedented obstruction of Congress to our democracy?
2019-12-04	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, would you agree that the president’s refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas invokes the framers worst fears and endangers our democracy?
2019-12-04	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Karlan, do you have anything to add to that analysis?
2019-12-04	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Please.
2019-12-04	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you Professor. One of the most important questions that every member of this committee must decide is whether we are a nation of laws and not men. It used to be an easy answer. One we could all agree on. When President Nixon defied the law and obstructed justice, he was held to account by people on both sides who knew that for our Republic to endure, we must have fidelity to our country rather than one party or one man. The obstruction we’re looking at today is far worse than President Nixon’s behavior. Future generations will measure us, every single member of this committee, by how we choose to answer that question. I hope we get it right. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	We’ve heard today from some suggesting that this process has somehow been unfair. Mr. Goldman, let’s clear up that record. Minority members on the investigative committees had access to all witness depositions, is that correct?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	And were they allowed to ask questions of every witness?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	And the minority were allowed to call their own witnesses to the live hearings, is that correct?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, why did the investigative committees decide to conduct initial depositions behind closed doors?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	And this is unprecedented because in both the Nixon and Clinton impeachment inquiries, there were either closed door depositions or grand jury proceedings at the beginning of the inquiries.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	And for clarity, President Trump has received all procedural protections afforded to other presidents facing impeachment. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	And the President has been invited to participate in the House’s impeachment inquiry, correct?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	But the President declined the invitation.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Twice?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	In fact, the President not only refused to participate, but he has also tried to stop Congress from obtaining evidence. Isn’t it true that the President has refused to produce any documents in response to the impeachment inquiry’s subpoena to the White House?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Not a single one.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	The President also directed all of his agencies to refuse to produce documents. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Based on the President’s order, federal agencies have ignored more than 70 specific requests or demand for records from the investigative committees. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	Quickly please.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	The President’s order to obstruct Congress didn’t just extend to documents. at the President’s direction, witnesses also refused to testify, is that right?
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	And in total, more than a dozen members of the administration defied lawful subpoenas or requests for testimony or documents, as we see on the slide.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	And isn’t also true that when witnesses chose to follow the laws and testify, the President denied those witnesses access to the documents they needed to properly prepare for their testimony.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	The President was not denied the right to participate. Quite the opposite. The President has chosen not to participate, and he has consistently tried to obstruct the impeachment investigation to ensure no one testifies against him, that no one produces a document that may incriminate him, and to engage in a cover up to prevent the American people from learning the truth.
2019-12-09	Greg Stanton	D-Others	Democrat	I yield back.
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	I did not serve in the military, but my 81-year-old father did. He was an Air Force veteran stationed in Germany during the height of the Cold War in the late 1950s. He was a teenager from inner-city Newark, a stranger in a foreign land serving on the Western side of the Berlin Wall. My dad proudly wore the uniform because he swore an oath to the constitution and believed in American democracy. I believe in American democracy. We remain the last best hope on earth. It is in that spirit that we proceed today. Professor Karlan, in America, we believe in free and fair elections. Is that correct?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	But authoritarian regimes do not. Is that right?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Thomas Jefferson once wrote, or John Adams once wrote to Thomas Jefferson on December 6, 1787, and stated, “You are apprehensive of foreign interference, intrigue, influence, so am I, but as often as elections happen, the danger of foreign influence recurs.” Professor Karlan, how important was the concept of free and fair elections to the framers of the constitution?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	And is it fair to say that an election cannot be reasonably characterized as free and fair if it’s manipulated by foreign interference?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	And the framers of the constitution were generally and deeply concerned with the threat of foreign interference in the domestic affairs of the United States. True?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	And why were they so deeply concerned?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	And would the framers find it acceptable for an American president to pressure a foreign government to help him win an election?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Direct evidence shows that on July 25th phone call, the president ordered five words, “Do us a favor, though.” He pressured the Ukrainian government to target an American citizen for political gain and the same time simultaneously withheld $391 million in military aid. Now, Ambassador Bill Taylor, West Point graduate, Vietnam War hero, Republican-appointed diplomat discussed this issue of military aid. Here is a clip of his testimony.
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	To the extent the military aid was being withheld as part of an effort to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election, is that behavior impeachable?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	And is it correct that an abusive power that strikes at the heart of our democracy falls squarely within the definition of a high crime and misdemeanor?
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Some of my colleagues have suggested that impeachment would overturn the will of the people. The American people expressed their will in November of 2018. The will of the people elected a new majority. The will of the people elected a house that would not function as a wholly-owned subsidiary of this administration. The will of the people elected a house that understands we are separate and coequal branch of government.
2019-12-04	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	The will of the people elected a house that understands we have a constitution and responsibility to serve as a check and balance on an out of control executive branch. The president abused his power and must be held accountable. No one is above the law. America must remain the last best hope on earth. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Let’s focus on the aid to Ukraine Mr. Goldman, Congress allocated on a bipartisan basis, $391 million in military aid to the Ukraine. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Does the record established at the military aid to Ukraine is in the national security interests of the United States?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	The investigation concluded that President Trump compromised US national security by withholding vital military assistance and diplomatic support. Is that true?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	President Trump and his defenders claim that he withheld military aid out of alleged concern with corruption in Ukraine. Let’s explore this phony justification. Donald Trump first spoke to the president of Ukraine on an April 21st call, correct?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	President Trump never use the word corruption on that April 21st call. True?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	That readout was inaccurate. In a May 23rd letter, Trump’s Department of Defense concluded that Ukraine met the anticorruption benchmarks required to receive military aid from the United States. True?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	And yet the aid was not released, correct?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, based on the evidence and testimony that you have reviewed, is there any reason to believe that the president cared about corruption in Ukraine?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Well, what the president did care about was a political favor from the Ukrainian government, and that is why he withheld the military aid. True?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Now, several witnesses testified as to the real motivation connected to the withheld military aid, including ambassador Bill Taylor. Here is what he said in his testimony.
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Logical, unexplainable, crazy. Mr. Goldman, according to the testimony from ambassador Taylor, the only explanation for the withheld aid that made sense is that the president was seeking help with a political campaign. Correct?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Ambassador Sondland is a Trump appointee who gave $1 million to the president’s inauguration. He testified that he came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations, correct?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is a decorated Iraq war veteran, purple heart recipient, and member of the White House National Security Council. He testified that it is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a US citizen and a political opponent, correct?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	The evidence shows that president Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine as part of a scheme to extract a political favor and solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election. True?
2019-12-09	Hakeem Jeffries	D-Others	Democrat	The president abuse his power. The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law. I yield back.
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the witnesses for their hard work on a long day. I want to thank them especially for invoking the American revolution, which not only overthrew a king, but created the world’s first anti-monarchical Constitution. Your erudition makes me proud to have spent a quarter century of my career as a fellow Constitutional law professor before running for Congress.
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Now, Tom Paine said that in the monarchies, the king is law, but in the democracies the law will be king. But today the President advances an essentially monarchical argument. He says that Article Two allows him to do whatever he wants. He not only says that, but he believes it, because he did something no other American president has ever done before. He used foreign military aid as a lever to coerce a foreign government to interfere in an American election to discredit an opponent and advance his reelection campaign. Professor Karlan, what does the existence of the impeachment power tell us about the President’s claim that the Constitution allows him to do whatever he wants?
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	If he’s right and we accept this radical claim that he can do whatever he wants, all future presidents seeking reelection will be able to bring foreign governments into our campaigns to target their rivals and to spread propaganda. That’s astounding. If we let the President get away with this conduct, every president can get away with it. Do you agree with that, Professor Feldman?
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	So this is a big moment for America, isn’t it? If Elijah Cummings were here, he would say, “Listen up, people. Listen up.” How we respond will determine the character of our democracy for generations. Now, Professors Feldman, Karlan, Gerhardt tell us there were three dominant reasons invoked at the founding for why we needed an impeachment power. Broadly speaking, it was an instrument of popular self defense against a president behaving like a king and trampling the rule of law, but not just in the normal royal sense of showing cruelty and vanity and treachery and greed and avarice and so on. But when presidents threatened the basic character of our government in the Constitution, that’s what impeachment was about. And the Framers invoked three specific kinds of misconduct so serious and egregious that they thought they warranted impeachment. First, the president might abuse his power by corruptly using his office for personal, political, or financial gain. Well, Professor Feldman, what’s so wrong with that? If the president belongs to my party and I generally like him, what’s so wrong with him using his office to advance his own political ambitions?
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Well, second and third, the Founders expressed fear their president could subvert our democracy by betraying his trust to foreign influence and interference, and also by corrupting the election process. Professor Karlan, you’re one of America’s leading election law scholars. What role does impeachment play in protecting the integrity of our elections, especially in an international context in which Vladimir Putin and other tyrants and despots are interfering to destabilize elections around the world?
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Now any one of these actions alone would be sufficient to impeach the president according to the founders. But is it fair to say that all three causes for impeachment explicitly contemplated by the founders, abuse of power, betrayal of our national security, and corruption of our elections, are present in this president’s conduct? Yes or no, Professor Feldman?
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	And Professor Gerhardt?
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	And Professor Karlan?
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	You all agree? Okay. And are any of you aware of any other president who has essentially triggered all three concerns that animated the founders?
2019-12-04	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, it’s hard to think of a more monarchical sentiment than I can do whatever I want as president, and I yield back.
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. Why is impeachment in the constitution? Well, the framers feared a president might corrupt our elections by dragging foreign powers into our politics in order to promote the personal political ambitions of the president above the rule of law and above the national security. The framers set against a potential tyrant’s boundless thirst for power, the people’s representatives here in Congress, and the people’s own democratic ambitions, our self respect, our love of freedom in the rule of law, our fierce constitutional patriotism.
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Now it looked like president Trump might get away with his Ukraine shakedown after all, most Americans didn’t know anything about it, and the few who learned a bit would be too afraid, too intimidated to cross the most powerful man on earth. President Trump could rest easy, but if Donald Trump misjudged the American character, the framers of our constitution did not. I count 17 honorable public servants who came forward to testify over the intimidation and disparagement of the President. Is that right, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	And I count a dozen career State Department and National Security officials who served Republican and Democratic presidents alike over decades who came to testify. In fact, four of president Trump’s own National Security council staffers, Hill, Vindman, Morrison, and Maguire came forward to report Trump’s scheme to NSC lawyers as soon as they learned of it, didn’t they, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	They went to the lawyers and that moved me a lot, because my father was a staffer on the National Security Council under President Kennedy. And he said, “The most important thing you can bring to work with you every day is your conscience.” And he devoted his career to the idea that people must speak truth to power when power becomes a clear and present danger to democracy and to the people. So I want to talk about two of the many honorable government witnesses who went under oath and stood up for the truth. Mr. Goldman, who is Dr. Fiona Hill?
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	And she was President Trump’s senior advisor on Russia?
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Her family had fled both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Oh, that was Ambassador Yovanovitch.
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Dr. Hill voiced her concerns the NSCs lawyers on July 10 and July 11th long before anyone on this committee knew about it, why did she go to report what she had learned? What motivated her?
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	And I want to talk about deputy assistant secretary George Kent, who served as a career foreign service officer for more than 27 years under five different presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike, and he wrote or updated notes to file on four different occasions to record his grave contemporaneous his concerns about the President’s conduct. Mr. Goldman, what were the events that led Mr. Kent to draft these notes to his file?
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	So do we have Mr. Kent’s notes in this process?
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Why do we not have them?
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	In authoritarian societies like Putin’s Russia or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, people are terrified to speak out about the crimes of their political leaders, but in the United States, a lot of people are not afraid. Even though President Trump has tried to intimidate or silence them. And he is trying to make our country more like Russia, and we can be thankful that you found a lot of heroes who stood up for the truth in our constitution. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Jamie Raskin	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, I’m seeking unanimous consent to introduce a statement by the late chairman Elijah Cummings of the Oversight Committee. In his first hearing in the new Congress, which was on examining prescription drug prices, his first hearing was not about Michael Cohen as was asserted earlier.
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chair and thank you to each of the four witnesses for your testimony today. I’d like to start by talking about intimidation of witnesses. As my colleague, Congresswoman Garcia noted, President Trump has tried to interfere in both the Ukraine investigation and Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation in order to try to cover up his own misconduct. In both the Ukraine investigation and Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, the president actively discouraged witnesses from cooperating, intimidated witnesses who came forward, and praised those who refused to cooperate. For example, in the Ukraine investigation, the president harassed and intimidated the brave public servants who came forward. He publicly called the whistleblower a “disgrace to our country” and said that his identity should be revealed. He suggested that those involved in the whistleblower complaint should be dealt with in the way that we “used to do” for spies and treason.
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	He called Ambassador Taylor, a former military officer with more than 40 years of public service, “never Trumper” on the same day that he called never Trumpers, “scum.” The president also tweeted accusations about many of the other public servants who testified, including Jennifer Williams and Ambassador Yovanovitch. As we know, the president’s latter tweet happened literally during the ambassador’s testimony in this room in front of the intelligence committee, which she made clear was intimidating. Conversely, we know that the president has praised witnesses who have refused to cooperate.
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	For example, during the Special Counsel’s investigation, the president praised Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager, for not cooperating. You can see the tweet up on the screen to my side. As another telling example, the president initially praised Ambassador Sondland for not cooperating and calling him “a really good man and a great American,” but after Ambassador Sondland testified and confirmed that there was indeed a quid pro quo between the White House visit and the request for investigations, the president claimed that he “hardly knew the ambassador.” Professor Gerhardt, you’ve touched on it previously, but I’d like you to just explain, is the president’s interference in these investigations by intimidating witnesses also the kind of conduct that the framers were worried about and if so, why?
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Turley, you’ve studied the impeachments of President Johnson, President Nixon, President Clinton. Am I right that President Nixon allowed senior White House officials including the White House Council and the White House chief of staff to testify in house impeachment inquiry?
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	You’re aware that President Trump has refused to allow his chief of staff or White House Counsel to testify in this inquiry, correct?
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	That does not include the White House Counsel nor the white house chief of staff, correct?
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Am I right that President Clinton provided written responses to 81 interrogatories from the house judiciary committee during that impeachment inquiry?
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Sounds about right. You’re aware that President Trump has refused any requests for information submitted by the intelligence committee and this impeachment inquiry?
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Are you familiar with the letter issued by White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, on October 8th written on behalf of President Trump and in effect instructing executive branch officials not to testify in this impeachment inquiry?
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Am I correct that no president in the history of the Republic before President Trump has ever issued a general order instructing executive branch officials not to testify in an impeachment inquiry?
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Well Professor Turley, I would just again refer you back to the history that’s been recounted by each of the distinguished scholars here today because we know as we recount these examples, that President Nixon did in fact allow his chief of staff and his chief counsel to testify and this president has not. We know that President Clinton responded to interrogatories propounded by that impeachment inquiry.
2019-12-04	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	This president has not. At the end of the day, this Congress and this committee has an obligation to ensure that the law is enforced. With that I yield back bounce my talk.
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and as we approached the ninth hour of this hearing, I want to thank both Mr. Goldman and Mr. Castor for being here today and for your testimony.
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	There’s been a lot of discussion about whether or not the facts in this matter are contested. I believe they are not contested, and so I’d like to level set here, and give you both an opportunity to address some of the facts that I believe are not in dispute. And I want to begin by addressing something that I think we all know for certain, and that’s that Russia interfered in our 2016 election.
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	So Mr. Goldman, after two years of investigation, the Special Counsel concluded that Russia interfered in our elections in, quote, “sweeping and systemic fashion.” Is that right?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	All right. Mr. Castor, is that right?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	And, Mr. Goldman, am I correct that zero intelligence agencies have publicly stated that Ukraine attacked our elections in 2016? Is that right?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Castor, correct?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	I hear you, and you’ve said that previously. I guess I’m asking you-
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	And there are no intelligence agencies in the United States that have publicly stated that Ukraine has attacked our elections right? You’re not testifying that that’s the case?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	And in fact, President Trump’s former Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, said that the idea of Ukraine, for example, hacking the DNC server was, quote, “not only a conspiracy theory, it is completely debunked.” That’s President Trump’s Homeland Security Advisor that said those words that you see on the screen to my right. Is that right, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Castor, you saw that interview?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	In fact, isn’t it true that none of the witnesses that appeared before your committee testified in support of the theory that Ukraine somehow interfered in our elections? Is that right, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Castor?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. No witnesses testified in support … I’ll reclaim my time. No witnesses testified in support of that theory before your committee.
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, isn’t it also true that your committee in fact received testimony indicating that there is evidence that Russia is in part perpetrating this false theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 elections because Russia wants to deflect blame for its own involvement?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	And, in fact, I’d like to put some of the testimony that I believe you might be referencing, Mr. Goldman, on the screen in front of you, both from Mr. Holmes as well as Dr. Fiona Hill, and I will quote from her testimony. “I am very confident based on all the analysis that has been done,” and again, I don’t want to start getting into intelligence matters, “that the Ukraine government did not interfere in our election in 2016. This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.” You recall that testimony, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	So given your testimony, and given yours as well, Mr. Castor, it strikes me that there are in fact four uncontested facts. First, Russia attacked our 2016 elections. Several intelligence agencies have independently confirmed that this is true. Second, Ukraine did not attack our 2016 elections. There’s absolutely no evidence of this baseless conspiracy theory. Third, there is evidence that Russia perpetrated the allegation that Ukraine interfered in our 2016 elections. And, finally, that Russia benefits from the US investigating Ukraine, which was made clear through public testimony before your committee.
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	So, Mr. Goldman, is it fair to say that the intelligence community agrees with these four conclusions?
2019-12-09	Joe Neguse	D-Others	Democrat	And if that is the case, it begs the question, why would President Trump perpetuate this conspiracy theory already disproven by the entirety of the intelligence community that actually helps our adversary, a country that is attacking our elections in real time? With that, I yield.
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you very much, and I want to thank the witnesses, and I don’t believe the people’s House is a swamp. President Nixon was impeached for abuse of power because his conduct was, quote, “undertaken for his personal political advantage and not in furtherance of any valid national policy objective.
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	President Gerhardt. Why was it significant that President Nixon acted for his personal political advantage and not in furtherance of any valid national policy objective?
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	So, can the same be said of President Trump?
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Well, thank you. You know, I’m struck by the parallels, because one of the things that Nixon did was he launched tax investigations of his political opponents. Here, the evidence shows Trump tried to launch a criminal investigation of his political opponent by a foreign government. We have heard evidence suggesting that President Trump did this for his own personal gain and not for any national policy interest. Although president Trump claims that he withheld the aid because of concerns about corruption, I do believe that we have example of the evidence of the truth.
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Feldman, what would the framers have thought of a president who only cares about the, quote, big stuff that benefits him.
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	So, the evidence also suggests that President Trump didn’t even care if the investigation actually happened. What he really cared about was the public announcement of the investigation. So, Professor Karlan, how do we analyze these facts in the context of abuse of power?
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	I also serve on the foreign affairs committee, and I understand how significant it is to foreign leaders to meet with our presidents. To attend a meeting in the Oval Office is very significant.
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	President Zelensky is a newly elected head of state in a fledgling democracy. His country is at war with his neighbor. Russia invaded and is occupying his country’s territory. He needed the military resources to defend his country. He needed the diplomatic recognition of the American president, and he was prepared to do whatever the president demanded.
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Many years ago, I worked in the nation’s largest trauma unit as a PA, a physician assistant. I saw people at their worst in severe pain after accidents or acts of violence. Patients I took care of were desperate and afraid and had to wait five to eight hours to be seen. Can you imagine, for one minute, if I had told my patients, “Look, I can move you up in line and take care of your pain, but I do need a favor from you, though.
2019-12-04	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	My patients were in pain, and they were desperate, and they would have agreed to do anything I asked. This would have been such an abuse of my position because of the power dynamic. I had the power to relieve my patients from experiencing pain. It’s fundamentally wrong and, in many cases, illegal for us to use power to take advantage of those in crisis, especially a president, especially when lives are at stake. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Collins.
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Yes, certainly. Mr. Castor.
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Yes, certainly.
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, I want to pick up on the President using the powers of his office, in this case in a meeting at the White House, to pressure a foreign country to investigate his political rival. Now that you’ve had time to step back from the investigation, is there any doubt that the President did in fact use a White House visit to pressure President Zelensky to announce investigations of his political rival to benefit his reelection campaign?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	My colleague Mr. Deutch, mostly focused on the period prior to the July 25th call. I’d like to focus on the period after. Following the call, did President Zelensky come to the White House for a meeting?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	So has a White House meeting been scheduled?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	So did the President and his associates essentially continue to withhold the White House meeting? And if so, why did they do that?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Well following the July 25th call, Ambassador Sondland and Volker worked closely with Mr. Giuliani and the Ukrainians to help draft a statement that the President could make, President Zelensky. Wasn’t that right?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Do you know what that statement was supposed to say? According to Mr. Giuliani in the US officials?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	But was there concerns about doing the investigations? Or what? Were they just supposed to make a statement about it? What?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	And so did the committee find that without that public statement that there would be no White House meeting?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	So I was struck by how clear the evidence seems to be on this point. And I’d like to play another example.
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	Mr Goldman, did the investigative committees find that Mr. Giuliani played a role in the White House visit being conditioned on investigations?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	So what evidence did the committee find that corroborated the quote “Everyone was in the loop.”?
2019-12-09	Karen Bass	D-Others	Democrat	I do want to make a point before my time goes out. We have to think about what is going on today. So President Zelensky is meeting with Putin today. And because of President Trump’s actions, Zelensky is in a weakened position to negotiate with the leader of the nation that invaded his country. If our military assistance had been provided as Congress ordered it, and the White House meeting, President Zelensky would be meeting with Putin from a position of strength. If you want the support… And what we have to realize that the message this sends to our allies, and to our standing in the world, if you want the support of the United States, be prepared to help with President Trump’s reelection. President Trump’s abuse of power has injured our nation.
2019-12-04	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I’d like to thank our witnesses for being here today. I can assure your testimony is important not only to this body but to America that is listening very intently on what the issues before us are and why is it so important that all of us understand the issues before us. Professor Feldman, as was just discussed, President Trump has ordered the executive branch to completely blockade the efforts of this House to investigate whether he committed high crimes and misdemeanors in his dealings with the Ukraine. Is that correct?
2019-12-04	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	President Trump has also asserted that many officials are somehow absolutely immune from testifying in this impeachment inquiry. On the screen behind you is the opinion by Judge Jackson, a federal judge here in DC, that rejects President Trump’s assertion. Professor Feldman, Do you agree with Judge Jackson’s ruling that President Trump has invoked a non-existent legal basis to block witnesses from testifying in this impeachment inquiry?
2019-12-04	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	And let me quote Judge Jackson. “The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that presidents are not kings.” Professor Feldman, in the framers’ view, does a president act more like a leader of democracy or more like a monarch when he orders officials to defy Congress as it tries to investigate abuse of power and corruption of electeds?
2019-12-04	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. Professor Gerhardt.
2019-12-04	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Where can we look in the Constitution to understand whether the president must comply with the impeachment investigations?
2019-12-04	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. And the president has said that he is above the law, that Article Two of the Constitution allows him to, and I quote, “do whatever I want.” That can’t be true. Judge Jackson has said that no one is above the law. Personally, I grew up in California in the 1960s. It was a time when we were going to beat the Russians to the moon. We were full of optimism. We believed in American democracy. We were the best in the world. And back home on Main Street, my mom and dad struggled to survive day to day. My mom worked as a maid cleaning hotel rooms for a buck 50 an hour. And my dad worked at the local paper mill, trying to survive day to day. And what got us up in the morning was the belief, the optimism that tomorrow was going to be better than today.
2019-12-04	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	We’re a nation of freedom, democracy, economic opportunity. And we always know that tomorrow is going to be better. And today I personally sit as a testament to the greatness of this nation [inaudible 02:40:51] in Congress. And I sit here in this committee room, also with one very important mission, which is to keep the American dream alive, to ensure that all of us are equal, to ensure that nobody, nobody is above the law and to ensure that our Constitution and that our Congressional oversight of the presidency is still something with meaning. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Goldman, my colleagues keep talking about the fact that the President apparently said, and I quote, “No quid pro quo,” on September 7th in a call with Ambassador Sondland. Mr. Goldman, did you receive testimony about this September 7th call?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Well, let’s try to clarify it a little bit. Ambassador Sondland described that call to Mr. Morrison that same day. Correct?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	And Mr. Morrison then reported it to Ambassador Taylor, correct?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	And both Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor took notes of those discussions.
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Were those notes produced to the committee?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	That set of notes was blocked consistent with the President’s direction?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	And in his recitation to Mr. Morrison, Ambassador Sondland said that President Trump himself brought up the words quid pro quo?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	And Mr. Goldman, what did the committee make of this fact?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Let’s-
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Go ahead.
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Well, let’s talk about that. What did the committee make of the fact that according to Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison, right after President Trump said, “No quid pro quo,” President Trump then told Ambassador Sondland that Ukrainian President Zelensky would have to go to the microphone and announce the investigations of Biden and the 2016 election interference, and that President Zelensky should want to do that himself?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	[crosstalk 02:17:18] They’re up on the boards here.
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	So let’s go further. As we’ve discussed, multiple individuals reacted with concern to President Trump’s call with Ambassador Sondland. Do you recall Mr. Morrison’s reaction?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Sinking feeling?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Correct. And Mr. Goldman, Ambassador Taylor also testified that he concluded that the military aid was conditioned on Zelensky announcing the investigations and he testified that this was illogical, crazy, and wrong. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Now, my colleagues have also pointed out that on September 9th, text message from Sondland reflecting the President has been crystal clear that there is no quid pro quo. Mr. Goldman, am I correct that Ambassador Sondland has now testified that prior to sending his text, he himself came to believe that the aid was conditioned on the announcement of investigations?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	And this September 7th call and the September 9th text occurred after the press reports, that is after the press reports that President Trump was conditioning military aid on investigations of his political rival, is that correct?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, did the Investigative Committee receive any other evidence relevant to the credibility of the President’s assertion that there was no quid pro quo?
2019-12-09	Lou Correa	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. I yield.
2019-12-04	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	No.
2019-12-04	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman and professors I want to thank you so very much for spending his long, arduous hours with us today. Thank you so much for being here. Following up on my colleague, Mr. Neguse’s questions, I’d like to briefly go through one particular example of the president’s witness intimidation that I find truly disturbing and very devastating because I think it’s important that we all truly see what’s going on here. As the slide shows on his July 25th call, President Trump said that former Ambassador Yovanovitch would, and I quote, “Go through some things.” Ambassador Yovanovitch testified about how learning about the president’s statements made her feel.
2019-12-04	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	As we all witnessed in real time, in the middle of Ambassador Yovanovitch’s live testimony, the president tweeted about the ambassador. Discrediting her service in Somalia and the Ukraine. Ambassador Yovanovitch testified that the president’s tweet was, and I quote, “Very intimidating.” Professor Gerhardt, these attacks on a career public servant are deeply upsetting, but how do they fit into our understanding of whether the president has committed high crimes and misdemeanors, and how do they fit into our broader pattern of behavior by this president to cover up and obstruct his misconduct?
2019-12-04	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	That is the woman President Trump has threatened before you and I can assure you, I personally know what it’s like to be unfairly attacked publicly for your sense of duty to America. Ambassador Yovanovitch deserves better. No matter your party, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican. I don’t think any of us thinks that this is okay. It is plainly wrong for the President of the United States to attack a career public servant just for telling the truth as she knows it and I yield back the balance of my time.
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, I want to follow up on just one part of President Trump’s conduct that, excuse me, I asked our constitutional scholars about last week. The investigative committees found evidence that President Trump intimidated, threatened, and tampered with prospective and actual witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, correct?
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	And, Mr. Goldman, it is a federal crime to intimidate or to seek to intimidate any witness appearing before Congress. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, am I correct that President Trump publicly attacked witnesses before, after, and even during their testimony?
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	I’d like to quickly go through some examples.
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	On Twitter, the President tried to smear Ambassador Bill Taylor, a former military officer who graduated at the top of his class at West Point, served as an infantry commander in Vietnam, and earned a bronze star and an air medal with a V device for Valor. He was attacked for doing his duty to tell the truth to the American people. Correct?
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	President Trump also attacked other Trump administration officials who testified before the Intelligence Committee, including Lieutenant Colonel Alexander S. Vindman, who is the Director for Ukraine on the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, the Special Advisor on Europe and Russia with the Office of the Vice President. Am I right?
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, I think another troubling example of this is the President’s treatment of Ambassador Yovanovitch. When you questioned Ambassador Yovanovitch, you asked her about the President’s remark that she would, and I quote, “go through some things.” She told you that that remark sounded like a threat. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	Ambassador Yovanovitch is a career professional who served in Republican and Democratic administrations. She was once caught in live crossfire during a coup attempt, and here’s how she described that experience in her very own words.
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	“It was our duty.” Even under such duress, this is a public servant who did her duty. And as she testified before you and the Intelligence Committee, the President tweeted yet another attack against her. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	At a rally, the President further attack Ambassador Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of the State George Kent, foreign affairs commission official with decades of bipartisan service.
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	I just have to say, I am so deeply saddened that our President has attacked our brave public servants. These attacks are an abuse of his power, and they betray our national interest. My Republican colleagues until now have agreed with me that this behavior is not okay, that in America we protect witnesses and people who tell the truth. We want people to come forward. We protect witnesses in our community. I, myself, am no stranger to these kinds of attacks. They are not okay.
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	I want to read a partial statement by Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, who was a military officer and a public servant. In his opening statement to the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Vindman said, and I quote, “I want to say that the character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible.
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	I ran for Congress because I care urgently about health care, gun violence prevention, and our veterans. Those are the urgent policies for me and many of my colleagues, but these witnesses, these public servants, stood up and courageously told the truth, and I must be courageous and stand up for them as well.
2019-12-09	Lucy McBath	D-Others	Democrat	And I yield back the balance of my time.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman, and let me just pick up where we left off, and I’m going to start, Mr. Turley, with your words, and it’s from October 23rd, your opinion piece in The Hill.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	You said that, “As I have said before, there’s no question that the use of public office for personal gain is an impeachable offense, including the withholding of military aid in exchange for the investigation of a political opponent. You just have to prove it happened. If you can establish intent to use public office for personal gain, you have a viable impeachable offense.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	We’ve heard today that a president abuses his power when he uses his official power for his own personal interest rather than the interest of our country. I’d like to spend more time on that because I’m really struck by one of the things that was at stake here. $400 million of taxpayer dollars.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	President Nixon leveraged the powers of his office to investigate political rivals, but here, the evidence shows that President Trump also leveraged taxpayer dollars to get Ukraine to announce sham investigations of President Trump’s political rivals. That taxpayer money was meant to help Ukraine defend itself and, in turn, defend United States interest from Russian aggression.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	The money had been appropriated by Congress and certified by the Department of Defense. Multiple witnesses confirmed that there was unanimous support for the military aid to Ukraine. Can we listen to that please?
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Feldman, you’ve stated that the president’s demand to the president of Ukraine constituted an abuse of power. How does the president’s decision to withhold military aid affect your analysis?
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	The evidence points to President Trump use the military for his personal benefit, not for the benefit of any official US policy. Professor Karlan, how would the framers have interpreted that?
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, and let’s go back to a segment of Mr. Turley’s quote, that if you can establish intent to use public office for personal, you have a viable impeachable offense. Mr. Feldman, do we meet that criteria here?
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Gerhardt?
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	I want to thank the witnesses, all of the witnesses for coming and testifying today. This is not an easy decision. It’s not a comfortable decision, but it’s one that’s necessary. We all take an oath to protect the Constitution. Our military men and women go and put their lives on the line for the Constitution and we have an obligation to follow the Constitution, whether it’s convenient or easy. Thank you, and I yield back the balance.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Words matter. In my earlier life professors, I was a professor of writing. I taught my students to be careful and clear about what they put to paper. That is a lesson that the framers of our Constitution understood far better than anyone. They were laying the foundation for a new form of government, one that enshrines democratic principles and protects against those who would seek to undermine them. The Constitution explicitly lays out that a president may be impeached for treason, bribery, high crimes, and misdemeanors. We’ve heard a lot of words today. Foreign interference, bribery, obstruction of justice. Professors I’d like to go through the president’s conduct and the public harms we have discussed today and ask if they would fit into what the forefathers contemplated when crafting those words of the impeachment clause. Professor Karlan, I’d like to ask you about the foreign interference in elections. As Americans, we can agree foreign interference, foreign influence erodes the integrity of our elections and as you said so plainly, it makes us less free.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Yet on July 25th, 2019 the president coerced Ukrainian president Zelensky to announce an investigation into his political rival. Trump’s political rival, which was corroborated by multiple witnesses throughout the intelligence committee hearings. Professor Karlan, can you explain for the American people in your opinion whether the framers considered solicitation of foreign interference and would they have considered it a high crime or misdemeanor and does the president’s conduct rise to that level?
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. Professor Feldman, I’d like to talk to you about bribery. During the course of the intelligence committee hearings, multiple witness gave sworn unrebutted testimony that the president withheld nearly $400 million in congressionally approved-
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Held nearly $400 million in congressionally approved aid on the condition that Russia, excuse me, that Ukraine announced investigations into his chief political adversary. Professor, in your opinion, given those facts and the framers’ specific concerns, would you describe the president’s behavior here in the use of his public office for a private benefit as rising to those levels?
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. Professor Gerhardt, I’d like to ask you about obstruction of justice. The president has categorically refused to produce any documents responsive to congressional subpoenas, attacked and intimidated perspective and actual witnesses including career and civil military, excuse me, military and civil servants as discussed here, like Ambassador Yovanovitch, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, Ambassador Taylor, Jennifer Williams, and others, and he directed all current and former administration witnesses to defy congressional subpoenas. Professor, based on that set of facts. Does this conduct meet the threshold for obstruction of justice as envisioned in the Constitution?
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. And thank you professors, all of you, all four of you. What you did today is you brought part of our constitution to life and I thank you for that. You’ve shown what the framers were mindful of when they wrote the impeachment clause of our constitution. They chose their words and their words matter. It was my father, Bob Dean, a terrific dad and a talented writer who instilled in me and my brothers and sister a love of language. He taught us our words matter. The truth matters.
2019-12-04	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	It’s through that lens which I see all of the serious and somber things we’re speaking about today, foreign interference, bribery, obstruction. The framers likely could not have imagined all three concerns embodied in a single leader, but they were concerned enough to craft the remedy, impeachment. The times have found us. I am prayerful for our president, for our country, for ourselves. May we, the people always hold high the decency and promise and ambition of our founding and of the words that matter and of the truth. With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr Goldman, I want to start off with facts and that you all uncovered through the course of your investigation. And I want to pick up where my colleagues, Mr. Deutch and Ms. Bass, left off. They walked us through how the President used the White House visit to apply pressure on Ukraine to do his personal bidding. I want to talk about how the President did the same thing with almost 400 million tax payer dollars to pressure Ukraine to do his personal bidding. So I’d like to start with turning back to the July 25th call. It’s a fact that in the President’s own words and the transcript submitted by him reveals that after Ukraine asked for military aid, Trump says, “I would like you to do us a favor though.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Now my Republican colleagues have suggested that the Ukrainians did not even know about the military aid being withheld. Is that true?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Correct. And what I also show you on the screen is that it was on July 25th, also the same day of the call, that the State Department emailed the Department Of Defense noting that the Ukrainian Embassy was asking about the withheld military aid.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	I’d like then to, let’s go back. There was also discussion earlier during the minority questioning that Mr. Sandy, from OMB, said that the reason for the security assistance hold was related to the President’s concerns about burden sharing with Europe. Is that consistent with the evidence that you all uncovered?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	So that was after everything came out to light?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, I’d like to enter into the record evidence uncovered by the committee from the House Budget And Appropriations Committees that documents OMB placing a hold on the Ukrainian security assistance on July 25th.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	So let’s review. On July 18th, OMB announced to all relevant agencies that the military aid would be withheld from Ukraine. On a call with Ukraine, on July 25th, President Trump’s says, do us a favor though, and ask Ukraine to investigate his political rival. Also on July 25th, in the hours following that call, both of Ukrainians and the Americans took action specifically related to that military aid. The Ukrainians began asking about the status of their military aid, and OMB took its first official action to withhold that aid. Mr. Goldman, I’m placing on the screen in front of you, an email from Ambassador Sondland to members of the White House Administration, in which Ambassador Sondland-
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	To members of the White House administration in which ambassador Sondland says, “I would ask a Zelensky to look them in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place, Zelensky should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to the president and the United States. Hopefully, that will break the log jam.” Did the investigative committees uncover any evidence on what ambassador Sondland meant when he suggested that president Zelensky would have to move forward publicly on quote issues of importance to the president to receive military aid.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	So the president was concerned about the two investigations and though that was the predicate for releasing military aid to our ally.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you and I yield back.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	And, in fact, pursuant to President Trump’s order, 12 executive branch officials refused to testify as part of the House impeachment inquiry, 10 of whom defied congressional subpoenas. Am I right?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Given the President’s sweeping directive not to cooperate with Congress, did the investigative committees believe that there was any chance that other administration officials would come forward if subpoenaed?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Some have said that the Investigative Committee should’ve gone to court. Did you decide not to go to court?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	So let’s take a look at that exact case, the McGahn case, because we’re all intimately aware of it.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	On April 22nd, this Judiciary Committee served a subpoena for testimony to White House counsel Don McGahn, and after McGahn refused to testify on May 21st, the Committee filed a lawsuit on August the 7th to compel his testimony. And even though we did request expedited ruling, it was another three and a half months before Judge Jackson found the Constitution does not allow a president to kneecap congressional investigations because, as the judge wrote, and I put up on this screen, quote, “presidents are not kings.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	As you know, McGahn has appealed, and a hearing is set for January the third now of next year. As we sit here today, eight months since we issued that subpoena, would you agree it’s likely we will not have an appeals court ruling for many months to come?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Exactly. McGahn may appeal to the Supreme Court, and conceivably that could take another many months, year, more?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	And given this delay illustrated by the McGahn example specifically, would you agree that if we go to court to enforce the Investigative Committee’s subpoenas, we could face another months or years long delay to hear testimony?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	And the urgency is not just about our elections but also our national security. Am I right?
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	Let me end with this. What is plain is that we cannot wait. What is plain is that wait means never. We must not let this president disregard, defy, and delay justice. This president has shown that he repeatedly abuses the power entrusted to him by the people. Every moment we wait is another opportunity to chip away at the foundation of our constitution so carefully crafted by our founders.
2019-12-09	Madeleine Dean	D-Others	Democrat	I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and yield back.
2019-12-04	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	I want to thank our constitutional experts for walking us through the framers thinking on impeachment and why they decided it was a necessary part of our constitution. I’m going to ask you to help us understand the implications of the president’s obstruction of Congress’s investigation into his use of the office of the president to squeeze the Ukrainian government to help the Trump reelection campaign, and there’s certainly hundreds of pages on how one reaches that conclusion. We know the president’s obstruction did not begin with the Ukraine investigation. Instead, his conduct is part of a pattern and I’ll direct your attention to the timeline on the screen. In the left hand column, we see the president’s statement from his July call in which he pressured Ukraine, a foreign government, to meddle in our elections. Then once Congress got wind of it, the president tried to cover up his involvement by obstructing the congressional investigation and refusing to cooperate, but this isn’t the first time we’ve seen this kind of obstruction.
2019-12-04	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	In the right hand column, we can flash back to the 2016 election when the president welcomed and used Russians interference in our election, and again when the Special Counsel and then this committee tried to investigate the extent of his involvement, he did everything he could to cover it up. So it appears the president’s obstruction of investigations is part of a pattern. First, he invites foreign powers to interfere in our elections. Then he covers it up, and finally he obstructs lawful inquiries into his behavior whether by Congress or law enforcement, and then he does it again. So Professor Gerhardt, how does the existence of such a pattern help determine whether the president’s conduct is impeachable?
2019-12-04	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	In addition to the money not being released, there also was not the White House meeting, which was so important to Ukrainian security. Right?
2019-12-04	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Okay. Professor Feldman, we noted previously that a federal district court recently rejected the president’s attempt to block witnesses from testifying to Congress, saying that presidents are not kings. The founders included two critical provisions in our constitution to prevent our president from becoming a king and our democracy from becoming a monarchy and those protections were presidential elections and impeachment, correct?
2019-12-04	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Based on the pattern of conduct that we’re discussing today, the pattern of inviting foreign interference in our elections for political gain and then obstructing lawful investigation, has the president undermined both of those protections?
2019-12-04	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	What is the appropriate remedy in such a circumstance?
2019-12-04	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. I’ve spent over 30 years working to help clients and school children understand the importance of our constitutional system and the importance of the rule of law. So the president’s behavior is deeply, deeply troubling. The president welcomed and used election interference by Russia, publicly admitted he would do it again, and did in fact do it again by soliciting election interference from Ukraine. Throughout the president has tried to cover up his misconduct. This isn’t complicated. The founders were clear and we must be too. Such behavior in a president of the United States is not acceptable. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for five minutes.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	The gentleman’s time has expired.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	[inaudible 02:09:33] I recognize the gentlewoman from Florida for five minutes.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, the Chair…
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Okay. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Correa. I’m sorry, California.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	[crosstalk 02:20:08] Can you please hold it until after-
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	… I do my questions, thank you.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	I recognize myself for five minutes.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, you talked about actions speaking louder than words. So I want to focus on why it was an abuse of power for President Trump to use the American government to pressure the Ukraine president to benefit his re-election campaign. Let’s look at what the President said in his July 25th call to the President of Ukraine. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman listened to the President’s call and testified that when President Trump asked Ukraine for a favor, it wasn’t a friendly request. It was really a demand. I’m going to direct your attention to this slide about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s testimony. Why did he say the President’s favor was a demand?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Am I correct that this vast power disparity exists in part because Ukraine has been at war with Russia since Russia invaded five years ago, and over 13,000 of the Ukraine people have died? Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	So, President Trump knew that the Ukrainian President’s back was against the wall and President Zelensky needed US validation and support, is that right?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Now, according to the US Ambassador to the Ukraine, and we have Ambassador Taylor’s testimony up there. It wasn’t until after Ambassador Sondland told the Ukrainians that there would be a “stalemate,” on the aid that Zelensky agreed to announce the investigations that President Trump was demanding. Correct?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Okay. And furthermore, the committee heard testimony that the Ukrainians felt they had “no choice,” but to comply with President Trump’s demands. Correct?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Okay. In fact, when asked in front of President Trump in September whether he felt pressured, President Zelensky said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of the USA.” Is that right?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Okay. Now the President and some of his defenders here have tried to excuse his misconduct by pointing to statements from the Ukraine president that he was not under pressure to give into President Trump’s command. Did your investigative committees consider those statements by President Zelensky?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Once could almost say it’s similar to a hostage testifying under duress?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	So, when the President made these statements, and up to and including today, his country was still under attack by Russia, still hadn’t gotten a meeting at the White House, and still needed aid from the United States. Correct?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	So the evidence is clear that President Trump knew he had the power to force Ukraine’s hand and took advantage of that desperation and abused the powers of his office by using our taxpayer dollars, basically, to get what he wanted, right?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	And that is precisely the kind of betrayal that our founders sought to prevent. I yield back to myself, and I’ll recognize the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Cline.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Chairman-
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman and many thanks to our witnesses who’ve spent the entire day with us. We’re very grateful. Despite what our Republican colleagues have stated over and over again, their own witness, Mr. Castor has agreed that these investigations have indeed produced direct evidence. Direct evidence, which any objective observer in my opinion would regard as overwhelming.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	That evidence proves that the president solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election, pressured Ukrainian President Zelensky to publicly announce unfounded investigations, conditioned a White House meeting… The president conditioned to White House meeting and $391 million on the announcement of the investigations. And then the president covered up his conduct and obstructed the investigation. Those findings reflect a serious abuse of power by the president. Yet we are being asked to ignore what we’ve seen with our own eyes and what we’ve heard with our own ears.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	So Mr. Goldman, I’d like your help in responding to some of the claims that my Republican colleagues have made today.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	The President and his allies say that there was no quid pro quo. In other words, they claimed that the President wasn’t withholding the aid in exchange for the manufactured political investigation. Isn’t it true that the aid was withheld and that there has been no logical explanation for the withholding of that aid?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. President Trump knew he had leverage over President Zelensky and in fact, David Holmes testified that Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that President Zelensky will ” do anything you ask him.” Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	You testified earlier that evidence shows that the Ukrainians in fact did know that the aid was being withheld. My colleagues continue to say, and their witness continue to say that there couldn’t be leveraged because they had no idea that the aid was being withheld. Yet there has been evidence that shows that they knew. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	And you’re right, it doesn’t matter. If you’re about to be held up at gunpoint by a burglar, it doesn’t matter whether you know or not. The intent is still there by the criminal about to commit the act. My Republican colleagues also make much about the fact that the aid was finally released, but isn’t it true that it wasn’t released until the President got caught?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	"Thank you. Earlier today, Mr. Castor attempted to explain away the president’s request for foreign interference in our election by claiming that the President had three concerns. That number one, the President was concerned about Ukraine corruption; that number two, he was concerned about burden sharing with Europe; and number three, he brought up the debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine election interference, which by the way, that last point we know is a Russian talking point."
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, did the investigative committees consider those three explanations, and if so, what did the evidence show about whether President Trump’s request was actually motivated by those concerns?
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. I’d like to close with what our scholars explained to us last week about why all of this is so important.
2019-12-09	Mary Gay Scanlo	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you Mr. chairman. I yield back.
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a deeply grave moment that we find ourselves in and I thought the threat to our nation was well articulated earlier today by Professor Feldman when you said, “If we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy. We live in a monarchy or we live under a dictatorship.” My view is that if people cannot depend on the fairness of our elections, then what people are calling divisive today will be absolutely nothing compared to the shredding of our democracy. After the events of Ukraine unfolded, the president claimed that the reason he requested an investigation into his political opponents and withheld desperately needed military aid for Ukraine was supposedly because he was worried about corruption. However, contrary to the president’s statements, various witnesses including Vice President Pence’s special advisor, Jennifer Williams, testified that the president’s request was political. Take a listen.
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Karlan, is it common for someone who gets caught to deny that their behavior is impermissible?
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	And one of the questions before us is whether the president’s claim that he cared about corruption is actually credible. Now, you’ve argued before the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court determined that when assessing credibility, we should look at a number of factors including impact, historical background, and whether there are departures from normal procedures, correct?
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	So what we’re ultimately trying to do is figure out if someone’s explanation fits with the facts, and if it doesn’t, then the explanation may not be true. So let’s explore that. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified that he prepared talking points on anti-corruption reform for President Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Zelensky. However, based on the transcripts released of those calls in April and July, President Trump never mentioned these points of corruption. He actually never mentioned the word corruption. Does that go to any of those factors? Is that significant?
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	So let’s try another one. Ambassador Volker testified that the president never expressed any concerns to him about corruption in any country other than Ukraine. Would that be relevant to your assessment?
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	And Professor Karlan, there is, in fact, and my colleague, Mr. McClintock mentioned this earlier, a process outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act to assess whether countries that are receiving military aid have done enough to fight corruption. In May of 2019, my Republican colleague did not say this, the Department of Defense actually wrote a letter determining that Ukraine passed this assessment. And yet, President Trump set aside that assessment and withheld the Congressionally approved aid to Ukraine anyway, in direct contradiction to the established procedures he should have followed had he cared about corruption. Is that relevant to your assessment?
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	And what about the fact, and I think you mentioned this earlier as one of the key things that you read in the testimony, that President Trump wanted the investigations of Burisma and the Bidens announced, but that he actually didn’t care whether they were conducted. That was an Ambassador Sondland’s testimony. What would you say about that?
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	And given all of these facts, and there are more that we don’t have time to get to, how would you assess the credibility of the president’s claim that he was worried about corruption?
2019-12-04	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	If we don’t stand up now to a president who abuses his power, we risk sending a message to all future presidents that they can put their own personal political interest ahead of the American people, our national security and our elections, and that is the gravest of threats to our democracy. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. Mr. Goldman, let’s focus on the Republican claim that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine because he was supposedly concerned about corruption rather than the fact that he abused his office for personal gain. And let me be clear, we actually do not have to read the President’s mind on this. As your report notes on page 10 and as we will see on television, he told us himself exactly what his intent was.
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	So the first and best witness about the President’s corrupt intent was Donald Trump. There is also plenty of corroborating evidence. So let’s just review some of the basic facts that we’ve already established. First, President Trump does not even mention the word corruption during either of his calls with President Zelensky, and he disregards all of the talking points that were prepared for him on corruption by the National Security Council. Second, investigations of the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election were not supported by official US policy. And third Congress authorized military aid to Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	Ukraine passed all the checks that the United States established to ensure that it was taking appropriate actions to fight corruption. And there was unanimous consensus among the State Department, Department of Defense and National Security Council that the President should release the military aid that Ukraine critically needed to fight Russian aggression. So Mr. Goldman, between the time that President Trump put a hold on military aid to Ukraine and then release the aid, the President never conducted an actual review or corruption assessment on Ukraine, did he?
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	And isn’t it also true that the Defense Department actually determined not to conduct a review on Ukraine after the President froze the military aid? Because Ukraine had already met all of the corruption benchmarks in May of 2019?
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	And in addition to Ukraine having satisfied all the relevant corruption assessments prior to US military aid being withheld, there is significant witness testimony that both the State Department and the Ukrainian embassy actually advised that a White House meeting with President Zelensky would help further an anti-corruption agenda. Correct?
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	And in fact, President Trump’s budget actually cut funding for fighting corruption in Ukraine. Now, Mr. Castor argues that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine because he was skeptical of foreign assistance in general. But in both 2017 and 2018 didn’t President Trump release military aid for Ukraine without any complaints about corruption?
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	So Mr. Goldman, the President was perfectly fine giving military aid to Ukraine in 2017 and 2018 but somehow not in 2019 so what changed?
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	Vice President Biden started running. So the sequence-
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	And the sequence of events and all the corroborating evidence makes it crystal clear that President Trump didn’t care about corruption at all. In fact, as he told us himself on national television, he simply cared about his own politically motivated investigations into his political rival. And you saw the clip where Ambassador Sondland picked up the phone, called President Trump, and then Mr. Holmes asked him what the President thought about Ukraine and quickly what was Mr. Sondland’s answer?
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	So we know what President Trump was interested in based on his words, his actions, and witness testimony. The President of the United States wanted Ukraine to announce an investigation into a political rival for his own personal political benefit to interfere in our election. And he was willing to use us military aid, which is taxpayer dollars and in-
2019-12-09	Pramila Jayapal	D-Others	Democrat	… use US military aid, which is taxpayer dollars and an essential White House meeting as his leverage. That is unacceptable and a grave abuse of power. I yield back.
2019-12-04	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like unanimous consent to place in the record a new statement from Checks and Balances on President Trump’s abuse of office by Republican and Democratic Attorney Generals. I have unanimous consent.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	But it struck me on yesterday when you put up on the screen Ambassador Sondland’s emails and who was on these emails and he said, “These are the people who need to know that he was absolutely right.” Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things had just diverged.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	So, Mr. Goldman, let’s get to the facts again. During the phone conversation on July 25 with President Zelensky, President Trump was narrowly focusing on his own political survival using his public office for private and political gain. The truth matters. Then we heard counsel for the Republicans say the president is concerned about foreign aid because you could kiss it goodbye. Assuming that’s referring to anti-corruption. Well, let’s look at the facts of the July 25th call, I happened to have read it just recently, which sharply illustrates the president’s willingness to abuse the power of his office for his own personal benefit.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	The memorandum of that call is on the screen in front of you and it shows that President Trump says, and by the way, right after President Zelensky spoke about defense support and the javelins, I would like you to do us a favor though. So this is a president’s own behavior in words. Mr Goldman, what was that favor?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, the investigative committees received evidence from multiple witnesses who testified that President Trump was provided specific talking points in preparation for the July 25th call geared toward protecting the American people’s national security. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	And those talking points were provided to help the president effectively communicate official US policy interests during calls with foreign leaders. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	And it is fair to say such talking points signal the purpose of a given call, correct?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	Witnesses testify that the talking points for the July 25th call, including recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine, which has a focus of American foreign policy in Eastern Europe. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	So to be clear, the talking points created for the president or the principals to discuss specific matters that really protect the American people, is that accurate?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	But witnesses such as Tim Morrison, the deputy assistant to the president and senior director for Europe, testified about what was not in those talking points.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	Are you aware of any witness who testify that investigating the bindings was an objective of official US policy?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	And anything ever found of those investigations that might’ve occurred?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	Anything ever found of those investigations that may have occurred with respect to the former vice president?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	So Mr. Trump did not use official talking points?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	And there were fact witnesses who confirmed that?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	So, Mr. Goldman …
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	So, Mr. Goldman, did the evidence prove that Mr. Trump utilized his position of public trust in order to accomplish these goals, his goals in order to hurt his domestic political opponent?
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	I’ve come to understand that America’s values of democracy and justice must have the vital pillars of truth, factual truth and trust. As a former judge and one who sat on this committee during impeachment in 1998, the truth matters. It’s clear that the president did not really care about fighting corruption in Ukraine, but wanted his own personal interests to be considered. That kind of puts in perspective Ambassador Sondland that they didn’t care whether Ukraine actually investigated, but really whether they just announced it. It is certainly well known that it is our duty as the president poses a continuing threat to under The Constitution pursue the truth.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	That is our duty. We are now proceeding to do our duty to find the truth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Goldman, Mr. Castor.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	I’d like to submit or ask unanimous consent to insert in the record referred in my questioning statement of administration policy, Department of Defense appropriations-
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	August 5th.
2019-12-09	Sheila J. Lee	D-Others	Democrat	And the call dated July 25th.
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I take no pleasure in the fact that we’re here today. As a patriot who loves America, it pains me that the circumstances force us to undertake this grave and solemn obligation. Nonetheless, based simply on the publicly available evidence, it appears that president Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our elections by investigating his perceived chief political opponent. Today we’re here to uphold our oath to defend the Constitution of the United States by furthering our understanding whether the president’s conduct is impeachable. It is entirely appropriate that we’re examining our nation’s history as relates to presidential impeachment. The framers of the constitution legitimately feared for an interference in our nation sovereignty and they wanted to ensure that there would be a check and balance on the executive. We sit here with a duty to the founders to fulfill their wisdom and being a check on the executive. We, the people’s house, are that check. Under our constitution, the house can impeach a president for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Professor Feldman, you’ve discussed high crimes and misdemeanors, and the fact that the high refers to both crimes and misdemeanors. Can you just give us a little bit of a summary of what high crimes and misdemeanors are and how they’re distinct from what professor Turley said they were?
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, professor. Professors Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt, you’ve all have testified the president’s conduct here implicates three categories of high crimes and misdemeanors: abusive power, betrayal of the national interest and corruption of elections. Is that right, professor Karlan?
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And professor Feldman and professor Gerhardt, do you agree?
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Karlan, you stated that the essence of an impeachable offense is the president’s decision to sacrifice the national interest for his own private ends. Professor Feldman and Gerhardt, do you all also agree with that?
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Based on the evidence you’ve seen professors Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt, has president Trump sacrificed the country’s interest in favor of his own? Professor Karlan?
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And is there a particular piece of evidence that most illuminates that?
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And professor Feldman, do you agree or do you have a different or the same illuminating fact?
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And a bill passed by Congress, bipartisan.
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt.
2019-12-04	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Let me get professor Turley into this. Professor Turley, you’re a self-described, self-anointed defender of article one Congress guy, but you justify a position that says legally issued subpoenas by Congress enforcing its powers don’t have to be complied with. It seems in this circumstance, you’re an article two executive guy. And your talking about the Johnson impeachment is not very useful. That was maladministration. This is a criminal act. Thank you professors for helping us understand high crimes and misdemeanors. We, the people’s representatives and the people’s house are heirs and custodians, the founders of [inaudible 00:20:54] country where the people are sovereign. We have a higher responsibility and charge with a sole power to uphold our constitution and defend our democracy and we shall do that.
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you sir. Mr Goldman, I’d like to bring us back to this president, not the next president and stay focused on the July 25 call and the president’s abuse of office for his benefit, no one else’s. Now as my colleague, Ms. Jackson-Lee confirmed, the president’s requests for these investigations was not an objective of us foreign policy. Correct?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Is there any evidence to the National Security Council wanted an investigation into the Bidens, Burisma or any alleged Ukrainian interference in 2016?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Any evidence about the state department wanting them?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	How about the DOD? The DOD want those investigations?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Did any witness tell you that they wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens or the 2016 election?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And we certainly know now that the Ukrainians did not want it either. In fact, they made it very clear they did not want to be an instrument, and this is a quote, “an instrument in Washington domestic reelection politics.” So the only person who was a beneficiary from that investigation is President Trump. And that’s why everyone on the July 25 call knew it was wrong. They knew it was wrong. The investigative committee heard testimony from three witnesses who participated in that call. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Right. Mr. Goldman, even in real time, the witnesses who listened on that call testified they were concerned by the call. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And in fact, both Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Mr. Morrison immediately reported the call to legal counsel. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And why did they do so?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And they reported the call that they actually reported that to the internal legal channels. Mr Goldman, I’ve placed Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s testimony about why he reported the call on the screen. Am I correct his concern was based on the fact that the president was asking a foreign power to investigate a US citizen?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Am I also correct that he reported this concern because he thought it was a sense of duty, a duty that he felt something was wrong?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And Ms. Williams, Vice President Pence’s aid was present for the call and she testified as you brought out or was brought out earlier, that it was unusual and inappropriate. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	Now when Vice President Biden got involved with the European Union and the IMF and Germany and France and said, you’ve got to do something about corruption. That was okay because they were doing something for the common good of a bunch of people as distinguished from what’s going on here where somebody’s doing it for their personal good. Is that not correct?
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	That’s the issue we’ve got to get in this committee to understand the difference between doing something for the national good, for the international good, for the common good and for your own good. That’s the difference. Got to get that across. And those witnesses, many career nonpartisan officials were clear they thought it was wrong to ask a foreign government to investigate a political rival. Video
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	And we are going to check that type of conduct. We are the people’s house and I yield back the balance of my time.
2019-12-09	Steve Cohen	D-Others	Democrat	That’s the issue we’ve got to get in this committee, to understand the difference between doing something for the national good, for the international good, for the common good, and for your own good. That’s the difference.
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, this month we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. My late father, Bernard Deutch, then Staff Sergeant Bernard Deutch, received a purple heart fighting in the frigid Ardennes. He gave blood, among tens of thousands of Americans who suffered… who were casualties. They served under officers and a commander in chief who were not fighting a war for their own personal benefit. They put country first.
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	They made the same solemn promise that members of Congress and the president of the United States make, to always put national interest above their own personal interest. The evidence shows the president broke that promise. Constitution gives the president enormous power, but it also imposes a remedy, impeachment, when those powers are abused. In July, President Trump said, and I quote, “I have an article two, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president,” close quote.
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Feldman, the president has broad powers under the constitution, including in foreign policy, isn’t that right?
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	And do those powers mean that the president can do, as he said, whatever he wants, as president? Can he abused the powers that the constitution gives him?
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Is using his power to pressure Ukraine to interfere in us elections and abuse of that power?
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, how would the framers of the Constitution have viewed a president asking for election interference from a foreign leader?
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Karlan, we’ve heard witnesses, over the past several weeks, testify about their concerns. When the president used his foreign policy powers for political gain, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was shocked. He couldn’t believe what he heard on the phone call. NSC Advisor Hill realized that a political errand was diverging from efforts to protect our national security policy, and Ambassador Taylor thought it was crazy to withhold security assistance for help on a political campaign. Professor Karlan, these concerns aren’t mere differences over policy, are they?
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	And offering to exchange a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance for help with his reelection, that can’t be part of our nation’s foreign policy, can it?
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Mr. Chairman, our founders granted the president of the United States enormous powers, but at the same time, what we’ve been reminded of today, they worry that these powers could be abused by a corrupt president. The evidence of abuse of power in this inquiry proved that our founders were right to be worried.
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Yes, yes, the president has the power to direct America’s foreign policy, but no, he cannot use that power to cheat in our elections. Remember, and I ask all of my colleagues to remember, the Constitution grants the president his power through the American people. The president’s source of power is a democratic election. It is the American people, the voters who trusted him to look out for them. We trusted him to look out for the country, but instead, President Trump looked out for himself and helping himself get reelected. He abused the power that we trusted him with for personal and political gain.
2019-12-04	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	The founders worried about just this type of abuse of power, and they provided one way, one way for Congress to respond, and that’s the power of impeachment. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I’d like to focus on the facts surrounding the President’s abuse of power-
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. Getting back to the facts surrounding the president’s abuse of power using the White House meeting as leverage for helping his political campaign. Mr. Goldman, President Trump offered Ukrainian president Zelensky, a meeting in the White House, but first he wanted investigations into the Bidens, and a conspiracy theory about meddling in the 2016 election. You testified that the committees found evidence that President Trump worked to exchange official actions for personal benefit, and I want to talk about that.
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	On May 23rd, 2019, a delegation of officials returned from Zelensky’s inauguration, and they briefed the President. In that briefing, President Trump directed government officials to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, isn’t that correct?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	And Trump’s handpicked Ukraine operator, Gordon Sondland testified that they faced a choice, either work with Giuliani or abandon the goal of a White House meeting. What choice did they make, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Right. And six days later, on May 29th, President Trump sent the new Ukrainian president a letter that said America stood with Ukraine, and invited President Zelensky to visit the White House. Isn’t that correct?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	And so at this point, the Ukrainian President expected that meeting.
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	But then they learn that they’ve got to do something more for the President. Sondland testified that there was a prerequisite of investigations, isn’t that right?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	And NSC staffer, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified that Sondland told the Ukrainians, in a July 10th meeting, that investigation of the Bidens was a deliverable, necessary to get that meeting. Isn’t that right?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	And, and in fact on July 19th, Sondland told President Zelensky directly that President Trump wanted to hear a commitment to the investigations on the July 25th call, correct?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	That same day Sondland updated senior, multiple Trump administration officials, that’s Zelensky was quote, prepared to receive POTUS’s call and would offer assurances about the investigations. Isn’t that, right?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	And on that same day, State Department Official Volker had breakfast with Rudy Giuliani, and he reported to some then by text message, most important is for Zelensky to say he will help investigation. Right?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Right. And later that day, after Giuliani, spoke with Yermak, evidence suggested Giuliani gave a green light to that July 25th call. Then on the morning of the call, Volker texted Zelensky’s aide Yermak. And that text to his aide said, and I quote, “Heard from White House, assuming President Z. convinces Trump he will investigate, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down a date for visit to Washington.” And the transcript released by President Trump shows Trump requests investigations and Zelensky agrees, isn’t that correct?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	And then after the July 25th call, members of the administration continued to follow up with Ukrainian counterparts to prepare for the announcement of investigations. Sondland texted Volker about efforts to schedule a White House visit, noting that POTUS really wants the deliverable. Now it’s just one of many messages during a flurry of followup activity, there were meetings, and calls, and texts on July 26th, and July 27th, and August 2nd, 4th, 5th, 5th, 8th, and 9th, August 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 15th. Mr. Goldman, August 16th, 17th, and August 19th, isn’t that correct?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	Here’s the point, these are our government officials who work for us. Instead, they were working hard to help the president advance his personal, political interest. Isn’t that what you found, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Ted Deutch	D-Others	Democrat	This isn’t a close call. We had a Ukrainian President at war with Russia desperate for a White House meeting. The President promised a White House meeting, but then he blocked the Oval Office. He blocked it and said, “I need a favor. Not a favor to help America. A favor to help me get reelected. Our framers feared one day we would face a moment like this, they gave us an impeachment as a safety valve not to punish the President, but to defend our elections, and our constitution, and that’s what we must do. I yield back.
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Chairman Adler. I first swore an oath to the Constitution when I was commissioned as an officer in the United States Air Force, and the oath I took was not to a political party or to a president or to a king. It was an oath to a document that has made America the greatest nation on Earth. I never imagined we now be in a situation where the president, or commander in chief, is accused of using his office for personal political gain that betrayed you US national security, hurt our ally Ukraine, and helped our adversary Russia. Now the Constitution provides a safeguard when the president’s abuse of power and betrayal of national interests are so extreme that it warrants impeachment and removal. It seems notable that of all the offenses they could have included and enumerated in the Constitution, bribery is one of only two there are listed. So Professor Feldman, why would the Framers choose bribery of all the powerful offenses they could have included to list?
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. Now, earlier in this hearing, Professor Karlan made the point that bribery as envisioned by the Framers was much broader than the narrow federal criminal statute of bribery. I think the reason for that is obvious. We are not in a criminal proceeding. We’re not deciding whether to send President Trump to prison. This is a civil action. It’s an impeachment proceeding to decide whether or not we remove Donald Trump from his job. And so Professor Karlan, it’s true, isn’t it, that we don’t have to meet the standards of a federal bribery statute in order to meet the standards for an impeachable offense?
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. Yesterday, Scalia law professor J.W. Verret, who is a lifelong Republican, former Republican Hill staffer who advised the Trump pre-transition team, made the following public statement about Donald Trump’s conduct. The call wasn’t perfect. He committed impeachable offenses including bribery.
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	So Professor Karlan, I’m now going to show you two video clips of the witness testimony relating to the President’s withholding of the White House meeting in exchange for the public announcement of an investigation into his political rival.
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	And then I’m going to show you one more video clip relating to the President’s decision to withhold security assistance that Congress had appropriated to Ukraine in exchange for announcement of public investigation of his political rival.
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Professor Karlan, does that evidence as well as the evidence in the record tend to show that the President met the standards for bribery as envisioned in the Constitution?
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	I’m also a former prosecutor. I believe the record and that evidence would also meet the standards for criminal bribery. The Supreme Court’s decision in McDonnell was primarily about what constitutes an official act. Their key finding was an official act must involve a formal exercise of governmental power on something specific pending before a public official. Pretty clearly got that here. We have hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid that Congress specifically appropriated. The freezing and unfreezing of that aid is a formal exercise of governmental power.
2019-12-04	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	But we don’t even have to talk about the crime of bribery. There’s another crime here, which is the solicitation of assistance of a foreign government in a federal election campaign. That straight up violates the Federal Election Campaign Act at 52 USC 30101. And oh, by the way, that act is also one reason Michael Cohen is sitting in prison right now. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you, Chairman Nadler. Let’s just cut through all the Republican arguments today and make things very simple. No one else in America could do what Donald Trump did and get away with it. No American elected official can call up a foreign government official and ask for an investigation of a political opponent. No one’s sitting on this Judiciary Committee can call up a foreign government official and ask for help in our reelection campaign. If we did that and got caught, we would likely be indicted. Now let’s focus on the President’s abuse of power in this case, because it’s actually worse than examples I just gave.
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	And I know that I first sworn oath to the constitution when I joined the United States Air Force on active duty, and the three core values I learned were integrity first, service before self, excellence in all we do. I’d like to focus on the first two, integrity first and service before self, because it’s ingrained in all military members that we cannot mix official duties with personal private gain. So Mr. Goldman, in this case, the $381 million at issue, that wasn’t Donald Trump’s money. That was US taxpayer funds, is that right?
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	And certainly the president should not use our taxpayer of money for his own personal benefit, and especially not to leverage it for his own reelection campaign, isn’t that right?
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	The president’s abuse of power is even worse in this case than just using official duties for private gain. It’s also just flat out illegal. You cannot solicit foreign assistance for your reelection campaign. There is a violation of federal election campaign act. A lot of whole people have gone to prison for violating the various sections of that act.
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	A reasonable person could also conclude that the President violated the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which Congress passed as a response to President Nixon’s abuse of power. So I’d like to explore that a little further with you Mr. Goldman. In this case, Congress with bipartisan support had appropriated taxpayer funds for this specific purpose of aiding Ukraine in it’s war against Russia. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	And not only had that money been appropriated, the money had actually been released to the Department of Defense, is that right?
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Okay. And then suddenly without explanation the President demanded that those taxpayer funds be withheld from an ally who desperately needed the aid. Mr Goldman, did they President notify Congress about his decision to withhold the aid?
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Okay. So the Impoundment Control Act was designed to prevent the president from secretly taking congressionally appropriated funds and doing whatever he wants with them. So is it true that in your intelligence report, you found the following in your findings of fact, President Trump ordered the suspension of $391 million and vital military assistance urgently needed by Ukraine and the President did so despite his obligations under the impoundment control act? Did you find that?
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	All right. So not only did the President abuse his powers for personal gain, and not only was it illegal, his actions also harmed US national security. So it’s a fundamental tenant of US national security to push back against Russian aggression. Ukraine’s at the tip of this spear, pushing back against Russian aggression. Is it true, Mr. Goldman, that harming the Ukrainian military also harms US national security?
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Last week, Professor Karlan confirmed that it is an impeachable offense to sacrifice a national interest for his own private ends. A slide shows what she said. Mr. Goldman, based on the evidence that you found in your report, is it fair to conclude that the President’s actions both leveraged taxpayer funds for his own private gain and sacrificed the national interests for his own private ends?
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Okay. I was also personally struck by Mr. Holmes’ testimony because it makes it clear that the President did not care about or foreign policy or US national security. He only cared about investigating his political opponent. Here’s what Mr. Holmes said.
2019-12-09	Ted Lieu	D-Others	Democrat	Look, here’s the thing. If any military member used official acts for personal gain, that member would no longer be part of the military. And in fact, last year a Navy commander was convicted for taking things of value in exchange for official acts. The US attorney who prosecuted case said to the Commander, quote, “Put his own selfish interests ahead of the Navy and of our nation,” unquote. We should not hold the Commander in Chief to a lower standard than regular military members. We should not hold their president to a different standard than any other elected official. No one is above the law. I yield back.
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	I’d like to refer you to the discussion of the May 23rd meeting in the Oval Office when the president met with those who had gone to the Ukraine for the inauguration. You briefly testified that you helped propose names for individuals to go to that inauguration. Was ambassador Sunderland, who was ambassador to the European Union, one of the names that you submitted?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	But he ultimately attended that inauguration. Is that not right?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	And do you know how he ended up as a part of that official delegation?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	You also testified that upon returning, Ambassador Sunderland used his “connections with Mulvaney” in order to secure this meeting in the Oval Office. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	It seems that this Oval Office meeting was a pivotal turning point in the Ukraine policy. Coming out of that meeting, who was given responsibility to your recollection? Who was given responsibility for the Ukraine policy?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	But didn’t you also say,
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	Have a little time. You did say in your testimony that you felt that that… You testified that Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sunderland and Ambassador Volker “felt that they had a mandate to take the lead” on Ukraine policy. Did you not?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	Have you ever heard the term Three Amigos?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	And what do you come to mean by Three Amigos?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	When did you come to learn about Mr. Giuliani’s role and what do you consider his role to have been?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	Was it normal to have a person who is a private citizen take an active role in foreign diplomacy?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	Now, Mr. Ambassador Taylor, you testified that there are two channels, a regular and irregular. What did you see as Rudy Giuliani’s role in Ukraine policy?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	And was that normal? Is that normal? To have a private citizen of the United States take an active role in diplomacy?
2019-11-13	Terri Sewell	D-Others	Democrat	Thank you. I’ll hear back.
2019-12-04	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Again, our holding up of security systems that would go to a country that is fighting aggression from Russia for no good policy reason, no good substantive reason, no good for national security reason is wrong.
2019-12-04	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	These weapons and this assistance, it allows the Ukrainian military to deter further incursions by the Russians against Ukrainian territory. If that further incursion, further aggression were to take place, more Ukrainians would die.
2019-12-09	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	To withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with the political campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.
2019-12-09	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	I and others sat in astonishment, the Ukrainians were fighting Russians and counted on not only the training and weapons, but also the assurance of US support.
2019-12-09	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	After our meeting with presidents Zelensky ambassador Volker and I traveled to the front line in Northern Donbass to receive a briefing from the commander of the forces on the line of contact. Arriving for the briefing in the military headquarters, the commander thanked us for the security assistance. But I was aware that this assistance was on hold, which made me uncomfortable. Ambassador Volker, and I could see the armed and hostile Russian led forces on the other side of the damage bridge across the line of contact. Russian led forces continue to kill Ukrainians in the war one or two a week more Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the US assistance.
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman.
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	"Like everybody here, I’m extraordinarily grateful to you for your career of public service. And I feel very badly about what you’ve had to endure. Like your colleagues, you don’t complain, you’re doing your job. I feel badly about the insults, the tweet this morning; the fact that you were smeared, not fired."
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	But the question, as you know, is not how you were treated. The question is why the President did what he did, and whether what he did was a breach of trust. The question really is about whether the President of the United States, any president, has the authority to withhold congressionally approved aid, to condition a White House meeting on extracting from a foreign leader a willingness to assist him in his political campaign. That’s the question.
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And that brings us to you, as part of this story, because the question is: Why were you fired from that position?
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	"I want to read a portion of the President’s call on July 25th with President Zelensky. And this is the painful part, when you first heard about it: “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news; and the people she was dealing with in Ukraine were bad news. So I just want to let you know that.” The other thing, he goes right into this: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of the people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great."
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	You indicated in response to my colleague, Mr. Castro’s, question, that if you were asked to approach a foreign leader, and condition American support on their being involved in our campaign, you would refuse to do that?
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And you’re aware, now but I don’t know if you were then, but that July 25th phone call occurred the day after Director Mueller reported that the interference in our 2016 campaign was not from Ukraine. It was active, concerted, energetic, and by the Russians, correct?
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	All right. Now, as ambassador, you had no knowledge of whatever it is President Trump ultimately seems to have wanted to get for cooperation in this investigation. That’s correct?
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	All right. Now you’ve been asked about whether a president has authority to replace an ambassador, and you have agreed that that’s the president’s prerogative.
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	But that assumes that the reasons are not related to the personal, private political interests of the president at the expense of our national security, right?
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And you’ve been the target of insults from the President. You join some very distinguished company, by the way: Senator McCain, General Kelly, men I admire. I think all of us do. General Mattis.
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	We’re not here to talk about that, unless the reason you get insulted as you did today, essentially blaming you for Somalia as if this is another step by the President to intimidate witnesses. He didn’t intimidate you. You’re here, you’ve endured. But there are other people out there that can expect the Trump treatment if they come forward. That’s a question for us.
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	"Now you also indicated that the President has a prerogative to appoint a non-career person; and to be candid, Republican presidents and Democratic presidents have done that. Mr. Sondland’s transcript is out. And he was someone who indicated that everything hinged… the White House meeting and the release of the vital defensive aid… everything hinged on President Zelensky being willing to do that investigation that would benefit the Trump campaign. You’re aware of that?"
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And you’ve indicated that’s something that you would not agree to do?
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And Sondland was quite willing to do?
0201-11-15	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	I thank you for your professional service, and I yield back.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Thank you. Just following up on Mr. Jordan. Easiest way to avoid investigation is to not do anything wrong. I want to talk a little bit about why we’re here. Official government actions can’t be traded for help in a political campaign. Let me give an analogy and ask each of you if you agree. Could a mayor of a city withhold funding for the police department budget unless the police chief agreed to open up an investigation on a political rival. Mr. Morrison?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Yeah. And Ambassador Volker, I’m sure you agree?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And the same would be true if it were a governor withholding the budget request of the state police unless the state police agreed to conduct an investigation on a political rival. You would agree?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	In your view is it any different for a member of Congress? Of course not, right? Would you agree that the President has the same obligation as the Mayor, as the Governor, as the member of Congress to not withhold aid unless he gets an investigation into a political rival? Mr. Morrison?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Thanks. And we’re having a debate here, both sides as to how to read what’s plainly before us, the presidential phone call where the President ignored the work of the advisors and the national security council of talking points, and instead chose to talk about the Bidens and talk about Hunter Biden and asked for an investigation. So we are just going to have to debate that. But isn’t the principle that no person, including the President is above the law, absolutely essential and worth the effort to make certain that we continue to guarantee? Ambassador Morrison.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	I’m sorry, Ambassador Volker. I’m sorry. Pardon me.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Yeah, and Mr. Morrison?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	It’s so true. And you know, we’ve had some discussions and challenge from the other side that the President has …
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Challenge from the other side that the President has authority in foreign policy to do what he likes. And in fact, he does. A recent president, by President Trump to take our troops out of Syria and allow the Turkish forces to go in literally meant that some Kurdish families went to bed Saturday night and woke up Sunday morning, packed their kids and fled for their lives. A lot of people, including both sides of the aisle totally disagreed with that, but the President has the authority to do it, impulsive as that decision may have been, unwise as it may have been, as threatening to our national security.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	We’re not talking about that here. And Ambassador Volker, I’ve listened to your testimony and I take it and thank you for making efforts to try to advance what had been a bi-partisan Ukraine policy, help Ukraine get rid of corruption, help resist Russian aggression. But what you came to learn painfully is that there was a sidebar Ukraine policy with Giuliani as the advocate and it appears Ambassador Sondland is very much involved. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	You don’t, but as you have been involved and with the benefit of hindsight, while you were working on what you thought was stopping aggression and eliminating corruption, there was a side deal here to get investigations going, correct?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Right, and thank you for that and thank you for your candor about Vice President’s Biden integrity and service. But the bottom line here is that at the end of the day, we’re going to have to make a judgment about what the President was up to with respect to that request for the favor and how it repudiated the policy that was the bi-partisan effort in Ukraine and raises questions about he in that hypothetical example I gave of the mayor, held himself to be above the law. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Thank you. What this hearing is about, I think was best stated by Colonel Vindman’s opening statement. The question before us is this, is it improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a United States citizen and political opponent. Very well stated. I just listened to Mr. Jordan, as you did as well, and I heard his criticisms of the process. Nothing really happened. A lot of people are out to get the president. I didn’t hear an answer to the question as to whether it’s proper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent. And to date, I haven’t heard any one of my Republican colleagues address that question.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, thank you. I want to ask some questions that go through the background. What’s come out during this process is that we had two Ukraine policies. One was bi-partisan and longstanding, and that was to assist Ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of Russia, to fight corruption, and to resist Russian aggression. Is that a fair statement, Colonel Vindman.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way a legacy of Putin’s Russia. Is it your understanding that when their prior president, Mr. Yanukovych, fled to Russia into the arms of Mr. Putin, he took with him 30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Vast scale for a poor country. And is it your understanding that powerless but motivated Ukrainians rose up in protest to this incredible graft and theft and abuse by their president?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And that was in the Maidan, it was called the Maidan Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, correct?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And young people went into that square in downtown Kiev and demonstrated for months, correct?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	106 young people died and older people died. Correct, that was in between February 18, 2014 and February 22, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	106 died including people who were shot by snipers, kids. Yanukovych had put snipers on the rooftops of buildings to shoot into that square and kill, murder, slaughter those young people. Is that your understanding?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	In our bipartisan support, and by the way, I want to say to my Republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side. Thank you. But our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that Russian aggression. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	That’s right. And the Giuliani, Sondman, and it appears Trump policy was not about that. It was about investigations into a political opponent. Correct? I’ll take that question back. We know it.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	And you know, I’ll say this to President Trump. You want to investigate Joe Biden? You want to investigate Hunter Biden? Go at it. Do it. Do it hard. Do it dirty. Do it the way you do, do it. Just don’t do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. That’s your job, it’s not his.
0201-11-19	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	My goal in these hearings is two things. One is to get an answer to Colonel Vindman’s question. And the second coming out of this is for us as a Congress to return to the Ukraine policy that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy both support, it’s not investigations, it’s the restoration of democracy in Ukraine and the resistance of Russian aggression. I yield back.
2019-11-13	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Thank you. I say to my colleague, I’d be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify. President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there.
2019-11-13	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	The question here is not a dispute about the enormous power that a president has. The question is whether in this case there was an abuse of that power. The President can fire an ambassador for any reason whatsoever. A President can change his policy as he did when he opened the door for Turkey to go in and invade Kurdistan despite opposition from many of his senior advisors. A President could change his position and our position on Ukraine, but is there a limit? There is, because our Constitution says no one is above the law.
2019-11-13	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	That limit is that one cannot, even as President, use the public trust of high office for personal gain. The law prohibits any one of us here on the dais from seeking foreign assistance in our campaigns. The question for us is whether the use of power by the President was for the benefit of advancing his political interest in the 2020 campaign.
2019-11-13	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	By the way, to my colleagues, if the President wants to attack Joe Biden and his son, he’s free to do it. All fair and square in campaigns. He’s just not free to change our foreign policy unless he gets his way to assist him in that campaign. That’s a line he can’t cross. Now, you all have been very clear about what our continuous foreign policy was. Ambassador Taylor, just very quickly describe why us withholding aid interfered with achieving our national security goals.
2019-11-13	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Right.
2019-11-13	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	Right. I want to go back, because in the historical context, Mister Kent, that you and Ambassador Taylor provided, we had 70 years of peace after the war in which we lost over 400,000 American lives. That took care. That was in jeopardy, as you described it, Ambassador Taylor, and that threatened each and every one of us up here and the constituents we represent. Is that a fair statement?
2019-11-13	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	I want to do three dates too. I only have a little time, but July 24, July 25 and July 26. July 24th, Director Mueller testified about his investigation and he established beyond doubt that it was the Russians who interfered in our election. He expressed a fear that would be the new normal. On July 25th, according to the readout of the President’s campaign, he asked the Ukrainians to investigate Ukrainian interference in our election that had been repudiated. Then in July 26th, as I understand it, this person who reported to you heard the President saying he wanted investigations again in Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Peter Welch	D-Welch	Democrat	So, this is the question. The new normal that Director Mueller feared, is there a new normal that you fear that a president, any president, can use congressionally approved foreign aid as a lever to get personal advantage in something that is in his interest but not the public interest?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Good afternoon. Thank you so much for coming in and thank you for your service. Dr. Hill, you stated in your deposition you?ve been accused of being a mole for George Soros in the White House, correct?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You said in your deposition, specifically a conspiracy was launched against you by convicted felon, Roger Stone, on the show Infowars, led by Alex Jones, right?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Good point.
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And they said, I?ll quote what they said about you. ?We here at Infowars,? this is Roger Stone speaking, ?first identified Fiona Hill, the globalist leftist George Soros insider who had infiltrated McMaster?s staff.? He said that on May 31st, 2017. I presume you?re not a globalist leftist Soros insider, correct?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I?d agree.
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I agree. Interestingly, you stated in your deposition that a similar conspiracy theory had actually been launched against Marie Yovanovitch.
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And you said specifically, ?When I saw this happening to Ambassador Yovanovitch, again, I was furious because this is, again, just this whipping up of what is frankly an antisemitic conspiracy theory about George Soros to basically target nonpartisan career officials.? Isn?t that what you said?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And-
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	? those, isn?t that what you said?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And I?m sure you?ve been watching with concern what?s happened to other nonpartisan career officials. We had Alex, Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, an American immigrant, questioned for his criticism of the president in a very unfair way, basically questioning his loyalty to the country. I believe that he?s also of Ukrainian Jewish descent. Would you say that these different theories, these conspiracy theories that have been targeting you, spun in part by folks like Mr. Stone, as well as fueled by Rudy Giuliani and others, basically have a tinge of anti-Semitism to them at least?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	These-
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I?m sorry you?ve been kind of wrapped up in these crackpot conspiracy theories. Let me turn to Rudy Giuliani. You became increasingly concerned about Rudy Giuliani?s increasing role in Ukraine between January and March of 2019, correct?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And I know you served in the Bush and the Obama administrations. I presume that George Bush?s personal lawyer and President Obama?s personal lawyers were never directing or heavily influencing Ukraine policy.
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And the concern for having someone like Rudy Giuliani having such a strong influence on American foreign policy is that, you know, basically that policy may be operating not in the best interests of America, but perhaps in the best interests of Rudy Giuliani or his clients or business associates, right?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And some of those associates included indicted folks Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, isn?t that right?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	We have an interesting character in Chicago who?s now been indicted. His name is Mr. Firtash, and Mr. Firtash has been indicted for federal bribery charges, another associate of Giuliani, right?
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And the question that we?re all asking is whether American foreign policy in Ukraine is potentially being run in their interests and not our own.
2019-11-21	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Thank you so much.
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Good afternoon, Ambassador, and thank you to the family as well for being here in support of you today.
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I’d like to direct you to an area of bipartisanship, namely aid to Ukraine. Congress, on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine, correct?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And that aid is being used by Ukraine to fight a common adversary, namely Russia, right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	The U.S. in fact has consistently partnered with other European countries to keep Russia at bay and maintain the peace in Europe, right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	As Ambassador Taylor suggested earlier this week, supporting Ukraine helps maintain peace so that Americans don’t have to go to war again in Europe, right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Suspending that aid and weakening Ukraine can increase the likelihood of the opposite, correct?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	The last time you were in Ukraine was May 20th of this year, right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	In his opening statement, Ambassador Taylor said he took charge in Ukraine on June 17th?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Therefore, there was almost a one-month gap between the time you departed and when Taylor took over, right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	During that time, on May 20th, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry, and others came to the inauguration of President Zelensky. Right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And during that gap in time Ambassador Sondland visited the White House, along with others, and got directions from President Trump to “talk to Rudy.” Those were his words: “Talk to Rudy about what to do in Ukraine.” Right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	In other words, isn’t it the case that your departure, and the one-month gap between the time you left and when Ambassador Taylor arrived, provided the perfect opportunity for another group of people to basically take over Ukraine policy? Isn’t that right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Ambassador, you’re going to have to speak a little louder into the mic.
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Thank you. On page 10 of your opening statement, you mentioned “corrupt interests apparently hijacking our Ukraine policy,” right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	A couple of suspect individuals in that regard were Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You mentioned, in response to Minority Counsel earlier, that you learned that Fruman and Parnas were attempting to open a liquified natural gas company. Correct?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	How did you learn that, by the way?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Interestingly, at noon today, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Rudy Giuliani stood to personally profit from that liquified natural gas venture. Do you have any knowledge of that?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Maybe we should talk to Rudy, huh?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Ambassador, I’d like to direct you to another line of questioning that I had for Ambassador Taylor earlier this week. He said that “There were irregular channels of diplomacy at work in Ukraine, circumventing normal diplomatic channels and threatening American interests in favor of private interests.
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I asked him the question: “Can you rule out the possibility that these irregular channels of diplomacy are being used in other countries where we conduct foreign policy?” In response, he said that he could not rule it out.
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Ambassador Yovanovitch, I ask you, and I assume that you can’t rule it out either. Correct?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I understand. Are you concerned that these irregular channels of diplomacy may be at work elsewhere?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You testified that it was a “dangerous precedent that private interests and people who don’t like a particular ambassador could combine to replace that ambassador.” Are you concerned that other ambassadors may suffer the same fate as you?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Ambassador, in your service as an American diplomat, you have encountered various dictators and strong men ruling other countries, right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	In your personal life, your parents fled the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and they became familiar with despots and dictators as well, correct?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Indeed, you’re an authority on authoritarianism, right?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Is it a feature of authoritarianism to allow corrupt interests to hijack foreign policy?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Is it a feature of authoritarianism for the rulers there to claim absolute rights?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And is it a hallmark of authoritarianism for those rulers to smear their opponents?
0201-11-15	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Thank you.
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Good evening to both of you, and thank you for your service. Ambassador Volker, on page seven of your opening statement today, you said since events surrounding your earlier testimony, October 3rd, “A great deal of additional information, perspectives have come to light. I have learned many things that I did not know at the time or the events in question.” Correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	That includes conversations that occurred as well as meetings that occurred of which you weren’t a part, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Sir, you obviously were not a part of the July 25th call, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You were not aware that Ambassador Sondland, according to your opening statement, had a call with President Trump on July 26th, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	On September 1st, you weren’t present for the sidebar meeting between Ambassador Sondland and Special Advisor Yermak, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And you certainly weren’t part of the phone call between Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Sondland in which Ambassador Sondland, according to multiple people now, said that everything, a White House meeting as well as military aid were dependent on public announcements of investigations. Isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And certainly sir, you weren’t part of the phone call on September 7th between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump, in which President Trump insisted that President Zelensky go to a mic and publicly announce investigations of President Trump’s domestic rivals, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And certainly, you weren’t part of the September 8th phone call between Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador… I’m sorry, President Trump, where President Trump again insists that these announcements have to happen, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Sir, you say that you weren’t a witness to any kind of quid pro quo or conditionality between military assistance and investigations, what someone called missiles for misinformation today, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	But sir, you weren’t present for many, if not all of the phone calls and conversations where these alleged instances of quid pro quo occurred, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Sir, let me turn your attention to another topic that’s come up today. Or actually, it came up last Friday. You have high regard for Ambassador Yovanovitch, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I presume that you were aware that as the Ambassador was testifying, President Trump actually tweeted very disparaging remarks about her, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And I presume that you disapprove of those types of tweets, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You’ve supervised many, many people over the years during your career in the foreign service, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And you would never do that to one of your direct reports or anybody who worked in your organization, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	It’s just wrong?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And I also believe that you’re a man of honor and you would not attack a veteran, you would not attack someone who is currently serving in the military who’s doing their duty, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	In fact, there’s a certain man that we both admire, the late Senator John McCain.
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Who unfortunately was attacked, not only when he was live but after he died by the current President, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	And I presume that you would disapprove of all of those attacks on John McCain, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Well, today sir, as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was testifying, our President used the official Twitter account of the office of the President to attack Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s credibility.
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I presume you don’t approve of those types of tweets either, do you?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Thank you, sir.
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Thank you for your service, and thank you, Mr. Morrison, for yours as well.
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Good afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams. Thank you for your service. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I’m concerned that your loyalty has been questioned not just because you’re bringing forward evidence of wrongdoing against the President of the United States, but because you’re an immigrant. Recently, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade said, “He,” meaning you, “were born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.” I find this statement reprehensible because it appears that your immigrant heritage is being used against you. Lieutenant Colonel, I came to this country when I was three months old. Your family fled the Soviet Union and moved to America when you were just three and a half years old, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I understand that your father worked multiple jobs while also learning English, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Your father stressed the importance of embracing what it means to be an American, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	All your childhood memories relate to being an American, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You and your family faced difficult times during your childhood, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I can relate. That’s my story too, but your father went on to become an engineer, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I can relate. I got a BS in engineering. Of course, some people claim I practice the BS part now. Your father never gave up working hard to build his very own American dream, did he?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Well, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, your father achieved the American dream and so did you and your family. From one immigrant American to another immigrant American, I want to say to you that you and your family represent the very best of America. I assume that you are as proud to be an American as I am, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Sir, I want to turn your attention to Yuriy Lutsenko. You called him a disruptive actor in your opening statement, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Mr. Lutsenko, the former Prosecutor General in Ukraine, has made various claims about various Americans, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You are unaware of any factual basis for his accusations against Ambassador Yovanovitch, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	He also was a source for an article by John Solomon in The Hill, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You said that key elements of that article, as well as his accusations, are false, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Lutsenko is not a credible source, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Sir, the other side claims that there was absolutely no pressure on this July 25th phone call. I think that’s what we heard earlier, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You have termed what President Trump asked in terms of investigations on that phone call as a demand, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	You’ve pointed out the large power disparity between President Trump on the one hand and President Zelensky on the other, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	There was pressure on that phone call, right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	The pressure was brought to bear on them, correct?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Sir, Colonel Vindman, last week we heard a decorated military veteran, namely Ambassador Bill Taylor, come before us. You interacted regularly with Ambassador Taylor and you know him to be a man of integrity, and he’s a patriotic American, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I asked Ambassador Taylor a series of questions based on his experience as an infantry commander. I asked him, “Is an officer allowed to hold up action placing his troops at risk until someone provides them a personal benefit?” Ambassador Taylor responded, “No, sir.” Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I then asked Ambassador Taylor, “Is that because they would be betraying their responsibility to the nation?” Ambassador Taylor responded, “Yes, sir.” Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	I then asked Ambassador Taylor, “Could that type of conduct trigger a court-martial?” Ambassador Taylor said, “Yes, sir.” Do you agree with Ambassador Taylor, Colonel Vindman?
0201-11-19	Raja Krishnamoo	D-Krishnamoothi	Democrat	Thank you for your service.     Closing Statements
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I?d like to thank both of our witnesses for being here today. I?d like to turn our discussion to the campaign to remove career diplomat, Ambassador Yovanovitch. Both of you in your various capacities had to work with her, and both of you witness what I would call a smear campaign. I wanted to know your thoughts, Dr. Hill. What was your view of Ambassador Yovanovitch?s experience and quality of her work in the Ukraine? And do you consider it to be a smear campaign?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Mr. Holmes, would you agree with that? And can you talk about the character integrity and performance of Ambassador Yovanovitch both in Ukraine?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Did you see it as a smear campaign as well?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	And what was the effect that it had on the morale of other professionals that you worked with in the Ukraine?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	I?d like to now turn, Dr. Hill, to your boss. Your boss was Ambassador Bolton, right?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	And did your boss, Ambassador Bolton, tell you that Giuliani was, ?a hand grenade?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	What do you think he meant by his characterization of Giuliani as a hand grenade?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Was that narrative also inclusive of falsehoods about Ambassador Yovanovitch?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	I was particularly struck by your testimony, Dr. Hill, about receiving hateful calls and being accused of being a source mole in the White House. Are you a never Trumper or have you been true to your profession and remain a nonpartisan?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Yes, but you didn?t sign up to have hateful calls and the like.
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	I think that you [crosstalk 01:18:10] ?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Exactly. I think you would agree with me that this shouldn?t become the new normal. Would you agree?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	I also think that this kind of behavior, instead of keeping you down, would make you undeterred. Are you more determined to continue to do your work and to do it professionally?
2019-11-21	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Yeah. I unfortunately think that this become the new norm. And we?re being led by the very top of the food chain, which is our president, which is unfortunate. I?m especially disheartened by his treatment of women. I think that the fact of the matter is that there?s a long line of strong, talented women who have been smeared and victimized by this president. We can either choose to ignore it or do something about it. Frankly, I think that, whether you voted for him or whether you supported him or not, that doing so is wrong. You could simply just remove someone. You don?t have to smear them. Thank you. I yield back my time.
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador, in your prior testimony, you spoke so movingly about your family background. You stated that your parents fled communists and Nazi regimes and that they valued-
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	… And Nazi regimes, and that they valued freedom and democracy offered in America. Having experienced totalitarian regimes, did that have any effect on your desire to enter into the United States foreign service?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Did you always know that you want it to be in the foreign service? I look at your background, and it is perfectly suited for what you’re doing. I note that you studied at the [Pushkin 01:08:32] State Russian Language Institute in Russia to learn Russian.
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Do you also have an MS from the National Defense University National War College?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	I even noticed that you earned your undergraduate degree in history in Russian studies in college, and coincidentally, that was also my college, and you definitely are doing Princeton in the nation service by what you do every day. But I really want to know how it felt to have your reputation sullied, not for state and nation, but for personal gain. You spoke about how your service is not just your own personal service. It affects your family. And today we’ve seen you as this former ambassador, this 33 year veteran of the foreign service, but I want to know about you personally, and how this has affected you personally and your family.
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	But does a president have the right to actually malign people’s character? It may not be against any law, but I would think that it would be against decorum and decency.
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	How has it affected your family?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Because I do care. I also want to know how you think it affected your fellow colleagues in the foreign service. My Republican colleagues have said that since you received such adulation and embracing from your own fellow colleagues, that what occurred, the incident that occurred with the President and his cronies maligning your reputation, has that had a chilling effect on the ability and the morale within the foreign service? Can you speak to that?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Now, for the record, my Republican colleagues will probably try to paint you as a Never Trumper. Are you a Never Trumper?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	As a foreign service officer, you took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States without regard for who’s in office. Is that correct?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	ave you also served you in your 33 years for not just democratic presidents, but also Republican presidents?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Four Republican presidents. In fact, you joined the foreign service under Reagan. Is that not right?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Now, why do you think it’s really important that foreign service officers are nonpartisan? Can you talk to us about why it’s important for you to do your job and your fellow foreign of service officers to do your job that you’re nonpartisan?
0201-11-15	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Well, on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say thank you for your service. I yield back the balance of my time.
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Volker, it seems by early July it’s become pretty clear that Mr. Giuliani has become a major problem for the US/Ukraine relations. You previously testified that on July 2nd, you met with the Ukrainian president and his aide in Toronto. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	There you discuss Mr. Giuliani’s quote negative view quote of Ukraine based on a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, right?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Are you saying that you didn’t think that they were negative views?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Okay, but that wasn’t your description.
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	I was trying to get at who said the negative views, that you discussed negative views?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	And believed that they were negative?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	So was it problematic that he believed that they were negative views? Was it true?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor testify that on July 2nd, you told Ukrainians that they needed to quote cooperate on investigations end quote, you’re now saying that you don’t recall saying those words? Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Did you say investigations?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	And what did you mean by investigations?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Now moving to July 10th, Ambassador Volker sent you a text message, you sent a text message to Giuliani, and I think it’s on the screen now. And you said, Mr. Mayor, could we meet for coffee or lunch in the next week or so? I’d like to update you on my conversations about Ukraine. I think we have an opportunity to get what you need. Did you say that? Is that an accurate-
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	And what did you mean by what you need?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Later that day, you and Ambassador Sondland met with Ukraine officials at the White House. We heard from several witnesses that Ambassador Sondland told the Ukraines that they needed to cooperate with the quote unquote investigations in order to get the Oval Office meeting scheduled on the books. Were these investigations a part of the official US policy towards Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	But was it specifically about these kinds of investigation, you said the investigation was Burisma-
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Okay.
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	But was that the purpose of that, or was it because the president, you knew that, well that the president wanted those investigations to be done as a condition of for them to actually have a meeting in the White House?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Well Burisma is not, that has nothing to do with, you’re saying that-
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	With all due respect Ambassador Volker, we heard from two witnesses this morning that those investigations were not official US policy. Ambassador Volker. I don’t know if you understand what you were getting yourself into, but sitting here today, I trust you understand that pressuring Ukraine to involve itself in US domestic policy is just simply wrong. I yield back to the balance of my time.
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Mr chairman, I’d like to join everyone in thanking both of our witnesses for your service. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, as part of your policy portfolio in the white house, you maintain a relationship with Ukrainian officials, do you not?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	You explained earlier in your testimony that your job within the white house was to coordinate United States and Ukraine policies. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	You testified in the spring of this year that these officials, these Ukrainian officials, began asking you “advice on how to respond to Mr. Giuliani’s advances.” Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	What do you understand they meant by Mr. Giuliani’s “advances?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	As you understand it, under whose authority do you think Mr. Giuliani was acting under?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Did the Ukrainian officials you spoke to understand that Mr. Giuliani was telling them to investigate Vice President Biden’s son and debunk the 2016 conspiracy theories?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Do you think that the Ukrainian officials that you spoke to understood the underlining meaning of, “Mr. Giuliani’s advances,” to be both investigating the Bidens as well as debunking the 2016 conspiracy theories?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Exactly-
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Exactly. Now was this official US foreign policy to push for investigation into the Bidens?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Now, Ms. Williams, do you agree that pressing these two investigations was inconsistent with official US, Ukraine policy?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	I a-
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	That’s fair.
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Colonel, is it true that president Trump directed the Ukrainian president on the call on July 25th to work with Mr. Giuliani on these investigations?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	In fact, Mr. Giuliani has made no secret of the fact that he is acting on behalf of president Trump. As Mr. Giuliani told the New York Times, and I’m going to put this on the screen. He told them, “My only client is the president of the United States. He’s the one I have the obligation to report to, to tell him what happens.” He added that the investigations would be, “Very, very helpful to my client and may turn out to be helpful to my government.
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Colonel, is it fair to say that the Ukrainian officials that you are on a daily basis, well you’re in contact with given your portfolio, were concerned about Mr. Giuliani’s advances?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	In your assessment, did they understand the political nature of the request being asked of them?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Did they understand that it was affecting US domestic policy?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Now you testified earlier that you warned the Ukrainians not to get involved in US domestic policy. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Counseled them. In fact, you testified that you felt like it was important that you were espousing not just what you thought but, tradition and policy of the United States to say that?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Now why do you think it’s important for foreign governments not to get involved in political affairs of a nation like United States?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Exactly-
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Mr., Colonel, I’m running out of time.
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Is it normal for a private citizen, and non US government official, to get involved in foreign policy and foreign affairs like Mr. Giuliani?
0201-11-19	Rep. Sewell	D-Sewell	Democrat	Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here. It’s been a long day. The first time, it wasn’t clear. And so I just want to start with a quick comment: Your testimony in this inquiry broke the dam. You were the first one through that stone wall that the President was trying to set up.
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And I just want to thank you for that, because others have followed your example. And there’s an old expression that the first person through the wall gets a little bit bloody, and I think you must understand that expression in a new way. But thank you.
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	I want to ask you about the day you were let go. And I know this is a painful series of events, so forgive me, but I think it’s very important. It’s April 24th, and you told us a few things that really stuck with me: You said you were at the embassy in Ukraine, you were honoring a Ukrainian woman, a anti-corruption activist, I believe her name is Kateryna Handziuk. Is that correct?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Am I saying that correctly?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You were at your house?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Excuse me.
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And you were giving her the Woman of Courage Award, I believe?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Right. And of course, that’s the day you get a call from Carol Perez, a senior member of the Foreign Service. Did you know Carol Perez?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You’re both senior women in the Foreign Service, you had an opportunity to meet her before?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And she says, “There’s trouble coming. I want to give you a heads up.” Correct me if I get this wrong… and, “I don’t know a lot, but it’s coming from the White House, I’ll call you later.
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	But you are literally, that evening, honoring this anti-corruption activist, is that right?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	"And not just any woman, but a woman who was, you said, “horribly attacked and killed for her efforts.” And she wasn’t just killed; you said, I believe, that someone threw acid on her?"
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And I went and I checked during the break, and it turns out she was horribly injured and it took four months for her to die. Is that right?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Why would somebody attack her with acid? There are easier ways to kill people. Why do you think they did it with acid?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	That’s what happens when you go up against corrupt people in Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Do you remember speaking at that event?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	I went and looked at what you said. You said, “Kateryna paid the ultimate price for her fearlessness in fighting against corruption and for her determined efforts to build a democratic Ukraine.” Do you remember saying that?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And then your phone rings, and you hear there’s trouble up the street? And Carol Perez called you back later that night, right?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	It was 1:00 AM, I believe.
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Were you sleeping?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You had stayed up to get the phone call?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And that’s when she says two things, I believe, that really stuck with me. She said, “We’re worried about your security”?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You’ve just been honoring a woman who was killed for her anti-corruption efforts. And she says, “You’ve got to get on the next plane.” Was she speaking euphemistically, “Get on the next plane, you know, “when you get time”? Did she mean, literally, the next plane?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And that’s a pretty good flight back from Kiev to Washington, and you’re on your way to meet with Deputy Secretary Sullivan?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And he says to you two things. He says, “There was a concerted effort against you,” and he says, “You’ve done nothing wrong”?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	What I’m fascinated about is when he says, “You’ve done nothing wrong,” what did you expect the United States government would do next?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Did you expect them to have your back?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And were you surprised when you found out they weren’t going to?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Why?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Ma’am, in your opening statement, you said, “How could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	“How could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?
0201-11-15	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	I want you to know, Ma’am, that that is the very question we are determined to get an answer for. And I want to thank you, on behalf of your country, for your service and with our work in answering that question. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Gentlemen, thank you for being here. Ambassador Volker, I was struck by your opening statement. You moved a long way from the testimony you presented to us in October and I know you gave a reason for that, which is that you were in the dark about a lot of these things. Is that fair to say?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You learned a lot. You learned a lot, and what you said on page eight, I’m referring to your statement that you gave this morning… Excuse me, this afternoon. “That I did not know,” this is quoting, “I did not know that President Trump or others had raised Vice President Biden with the Ukrainians or had conflated the investigation of possible Ukrainian corruption with investigation of the former Vice President Biden.” Right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You didn’t know Burisma meant Biden, that’s what you’re saying?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	I got it. Well, you didn’t know, right? I mean, you were… Well, do we have to go through it, sir? I mean, you were there on May 23rd for the meeting with the President when he said, “Talk to Rudy,” and Rudy sure cared about the investigations, which you now know meant Biden, right? But you missed it on May 23rd, right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	I understand, but you didn’t read that as a request to investigate the Bidens at that time?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	That’s all I’m saying.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And on July 10th, you were in not one but two meetings in the White House where Ambassador Sondland raised the investigations, but you didn’t know it was about the Bidens, that’s your testimony, right? At the time?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Right. You heard him say investigations, you thought it was inappropriate, and the Chairman asked you about that, but you said, “Oh, it’s because I didn’t know it was the Bidens, I just thought it was inappropriate,” and then I guess when they were in the war room and Ambassador Sondland raised Burisma and the Bidens in 2016, you missed that too, as I understand it?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Right, and then of curse on July 18th, you knew aid was withheld, and then in August, you spent a good part of the time with this statement with Rudy Giuliani, right? I mean, you were the guy making the changes and interacting with the Ukrainians. You were putting in Rudy’s changes, which included a call for investigating Burisma and the 2016 elections, which you now know meant Bidens, right? You didn’t know at at the time, right? But now we know it, right? And then on September 1st, you were in Warsaw. I mean, you were at every point in this. You were in Warsaw and you were there when Ambassador Sondland told Andrey Yermak that he was not going to get security assistance, he wasn’t going to get a White House meeting unless there was the investigation and I understand you missed that, you were out of the loop then?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Oh, excuse me, you were not in Warsaw, but you heard about it right after from Sondland, is that right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	I got it. So, but now we know, right? Now you know what it meant, and you said, “In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	What are the objections you would have raised, sir?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	But would you have objected to the President asking for an investigation of the Bidens? As you sit here now, you said, “I would have raised my own objections.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	If you knew it was the Bidens?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And his son.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Right. And so if you had heard him ask for it on the call, and you said, “In retrospect, Ukrainians clearly would have been… It would have been confusing,” right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Is confusing the right word, sir? I mean, it would have put them in the position of having to do something inappropriate, right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Investigate the Bidens?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Well maybe sir, they understood that investigating Burisma and investigating 2016 in fact meant the Bidens even though you didn’t? I mean, at the time you were talking to Yermak and putting those changes in the statement, he had talked to Sondland, right? At the same time. And so the point being that they were put in an impossible position. They were being asked to do something inappropriate, and you now know that, right? And you would have raised your own objections?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Right, so in retrospect though, you would have raised objections. You would have said it was inappropriate-
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	… to do this?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And Mr. Morrison, can I just ask you, sir, so I’m stuck on this issue of you didn’t see anything wrong with the call, but you went straight to NSC legal to report it. Is that your testimony to us today?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Thank you, sir. Yield back.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Thank you both for being here. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, this may be one of your first congressional hearings like this, so you may not understand-
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	I can’t blame you for feeling that way, sir, particularly when I’ve been sitting here listening to my Republican colleagues. One of the advantages of being down here at the kid’s table is that you get to hear the folks above you ask their questions. And I’ve been listening closely to my Republican colleagues and I’ve heard them say just about everything, except to contradict any of the substantive testimony you’ve both given.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You may have noticed there’s been a lot of complaints and there’s been a lot of insinuations and there’s been a lot of suggestions maybe that your service is somehow not to be trusted. You were treated to questions about your loyalty because of some half-baked job offer I guess the Ukrainians made you, which you of course dutifully reported. I guess Mr. [Caster 00:01:03] is implying maybe you’ve got some dual loyalty, which is of course an old smear we’ve heard many times in our history.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	They tried to demean you as though maybe you’ve overstated your importance of your job. Of course, you are the guy on the National Security Council responsible for directing Ukrainian policy. We’ve heard them air out some allegations with no basis and proof, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti, I guess, will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them. We’ve even had a member of this committee question … this is my favorite, question why you would wear your dress uniform today, even though that dress uniform includes a breast plate that has a combat infantry badge on it and a purple heart medal ribbon.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	It seems like if anybody gets to wear their uniform, it’s somebody who’s got a breast plate with those combinations on it. So let’s do it again. Let’s do the substance. Can we do that? Because we’ve had a lot of dust kicked up. Ms. Williams, you heard the call with your own ears, right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Not secondhand, not hearsay. You heard the President speak, you heard his voice on the call?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And your conclusion was what he said about investigating the Bidens, was your words, “unusual and inappropriate,” I believe. Am I right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And Mr. Vindman, you were treated to a July 10th meeting in the White House where you heard Ambassador Solomon raise investigations, conditioning a White House meeting on that. Investigations that you thought were unduly political, I believe that’s how you described them, and you went to the NSC council and you reported it, right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And then later you two were on the White House call, am I right? You heard it with your own ears?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Not secondhand, not from somebody else, not hearsay, right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You heard the President’s voice on the call?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And you heard them raise that subject again, that Ambassador Solomon had raised before about investigating the Bidens, right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And I want to ask you, when you heard him say that, what was the first thought that went through your mind?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And you went immediately and you reported it, didn’t you?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Why?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Do you still have your opening statement handy?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Read the last paragraph for me again, not the one … the very last one. The second to last one. Would you read that one again for me? Because I think the American public deserves to hear it again.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	That’s the one.
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You realize when you came forward out of a sense of duty that you were putting yourself in direct opposition to the most powerful person in the world? Do you realize that, sir?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And I’m struck by the word … that phrase, “do not worry,” you addressed to your dad. Was your dad a warrior?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And he would’ve worried if you were putting yourself up against the President of the United States, is that right?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And why do you have confidence that you can do that and to tell your dad not to worry?
0201-11-19	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Thank you, sir. [inaudible 00:05:08].
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you for being here today. Ambassador Taylor, what year did you graduate from West Point?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	It was the height of the Vietnam War, wasn’t it, sir?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	What was your class rank at West Point, sir?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	How many people were you in your class?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	800 cadets, you were number five?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	So when you’re top 1% of your class at West Point, you probably get your pick of assignments, but you picked the infantry didn’t you, sir?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You were a rifle company commander?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Where’d you serve?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Did you see combat in Vietnam, sir?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Did you earn any accommodations for that service?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	That’s for Valor, isn’t it, sir?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Let’s talk about July 26th, a lot of years later. You go to the front, you’re go to Donbas with Ambassador Volker, I believe, and you’re on the bridge and you’re looking over on the front line at the Russian soldiers. Is that what you recall?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And you said the commander there, the Ukrainian commander thanked you for the American military assistance that you knew was being withheld at that moment.
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	How’d that make you feel, sir?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Why?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	You don’t strike me as a quitter ambassador, but you threatened to resign or you mentioned it in your statement. Before I ask you about that, let’s just talk about a couple of days later on July, excuse me, one month later on August 28th. You find yourself in Ukraine with the national security advisor, Mr. Bolton, right?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And you conveyed to him your concerns. You’ve testified to this previously about the withholding of military assistance. What does he say to you?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Now, he’s the national security advisor, works to directly with the president, but he tells you that you should bring it up with the secretary of state.
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Have you ever sent a cable like that? How many times in your career of 40, 50 years have you sent a cable directly to the secretary of state?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	This time?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	In 50 years?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	So the national security advisor who can tell it to the president himself and who shares your concern says you the ambassador serving Ukraine should cable the secretary of state directly and you do so, don’t you?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	What did the cable say, sir?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Without going into classified information.
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Did you get an answer to your cable?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Do you know what happened to it?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Secretary Kent, do you know what happened to it?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	And we know Secretary Pompeo was on the call a month early on July 25th. It’s not like he’s in the dark about any of this. What did he do with it?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	One other question, gentlemen. On September 1st you would call a meeting between the vice president and the president of Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky, in which right off the bat, the president of Ukraine raises security assistance. And the vice president, according to your telling says, “I’ll talk to the president tonight about that. I’ll make a call.” Do you know whether the vice president made that call?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Do you know what, if anything, the vice president had to do with any of this? What more can you tell us about the vice president’s role in this? Do you know if he ever raised this issue with anyone in the administration, whether he ever pushed for the release of that security assistance?
2019-11-13	Sean Maloney	D-Maloney	Democrat	Thank you. [inaudible 00:05:08].

2019-12-04	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Looks like we’re good. Okay. Mr. Chairman, there are 24 “ayes” and 17 “no’s.
2019-12-04	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Thank you Mr. Chairman and I too want to thank all the witnesses for their time and their patience today. I know it’s been a long day, but the end is in sight. As my colleague Ms. Scanlan, observed the similarities between the president’s conduct in the Ukraine investigation and his conduct in the Special Counsel’s investigation are hard to ignore. In fact, we’re seeing it as a pattern of a presidential abuse of power. Their president called the Ukrainian investigation a hoax and the Mueller investigation a witch hunt. He has threatened the Ukraine whistleblower for not testifying like he threatened to fire his attorney general for not obstructing the Russia investigation. The president fired Ambassador Yovanovitch and publicly tarnished her reputation much in the same way he fired his White House counsel and publicly attacked his integrity. Finally, the president attacked the civil servants who have testified about Ukraine just like he attacked career officials of the Department of Justice for investigate in his obstruction of the Russia investigation. Under any other circumstances, such behavior by any American president would be shocking, but here it is a repeat of what we have already seen the Special Counsel’s investigation. I’d like to take a moment to discuss the president’s efforts to obstruct a Special Counsel’s investigation, a subject that this committee has been investigating since March. Here are two slides. The first one will show the president as he did with Ukraine. Tried to coerce his subordinates to stop an investigation into his misconduct by foreign Special Counsel Mueller. In the second slide, this shows that when the news broke out of the president’s order, the president directed his advisers to falsely deny he had made the order. Professor Gerhardt, are you familiar with the facts relating to these three episodes as described in the Mueller report? Yes or no please.
2019-12-04	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	So accepting the Special Counsel’s evidence as true, is this pattern of conduct obstruction of justice?
2019-12-04	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Why would you say so sir?
2019-12-04	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	So does this conduct fit within the framers view of impeachable offenses?
2019-12-04	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	So you would say that this also would be an impeachable offense?
2019-12-04	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Thank you because I agree with you. The president’s actions and behavior do matter. The president’s obstruction of justice definitely matters. As a former judge and as a member of Congress, I’ve raised my right hand and put my left hand on a Bible more than once and I’ve sworn to uphold the Constitution and laws of this country. This hearing is about that, but it’s also about the core of the heart of our American values. The values of duty, honor, and loyalty. It’s about the rule of law. When the president asked Ukraine for a favor he did so for his personal political gain and not on behalf of the American people.
2019-12-04	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	If this is true, he would have betrayed his oath and betrayed his loyalty to this country. A fundamental principle of our democracy is that no one is above the law. Not any one of you professors, not any one of us up here members of Congress, not even the President of the United States. That’s why we should hold him accountable for his actions and that’s why again, thank you for testifying today in helping us walk through all of this to prepare for what may come. Thank you sir. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we just heard, the President and his supporters have claimed that the investigating committees are relying on hearsay and that they have failed to obtain firsthand accounts of the President’s conduct. Now, I’m a former judge and you, Mr. Goldman, a former prosecutor. We know what direct evidence is. Mr. Goldman, my Republican colleagues have suggested there is no direct evidence. Is that true?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Indeed, it is not true. Now, I don’t want to relive a law school evidence class. Instead, I’d like to go over some examples with you, and please tell me if they are direct or indirect evidence. Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Volker both testified that on May 23rd, 2019, President Trump told him to, “Talk to Rudy about Ukraine.” Is that direct evidence?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Okay. Thank you. And then we have the memorandum of the July 25th call between President Trump and President Zelensky. Is that direct evidence?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	So there is direct evidence that President Trump asked President Zelensky to look into these investigations and directed both President Zelensky and US officials to talk to his personal attorney about those investigations. Correct?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Well, let’s give some more examples. We also heard the testimony of three of the individuals who participated in the July 25 call. Is there testimony, direct evidence of what happened during that call?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	And the day after that call, David Holmes testified that on July 26th, he overheard the President ask Ambassador Sondland whether President Zelensky was, “going to do the investigation.” Is that direct evidence?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	And after the July 25 call record was released, the President got on the White House lawn and again declared that Ukraine should investigate a potential political opponent’s family, the Bidens. Is that direct evidence?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	His own words. Now, that seems to me like that’s a lot of direct evidence. Mr. Goldman-
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Now that seems to be like that’s a lot of direct evidence. Mr. Goldman, was there other direct evidence that the committee relied on in addition to these?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	We don’t want to relive that evidence class.
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Right. Well, is there anything wrong, Mr. Goldman, with drawing inferences from circumstances?
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	Well, I agree with you. I’m just disappointed that rather than to respond to this serious, factual, direct, and undisputed evidence before us, my colleagues continue to make unfounded arguments about the process. What President Trump did here was wrong. It’s unconstitutional. If anyone else did this, they would be held accountable.
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	I urge all my colleagues to face this evidence and uphold the oaths each of us have taken to protect our Constitution. Our democracy depends on ensuring that no one, not even the President, is above the law.
2019-12-09	Sylvia Garcia	D-Garcia	Democrat	I yield back.
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Thank you so much, Dr. Hill and Mr. Holmes for your service. I have no doubt after today that we?re a better nation because of it. We all know by now that in July of this year, President Trump sent an order to the Office of Management and Budget that congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine be put on hold. Both of you have expressed that Ukraine is the first line of defense against Russian aggression and expansion into Europe. That Russia?s priority is to undermine the United States. Is that right, Dr. Hill?
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Would you agree with that, Mr. Holmes?
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Dr. Hill, in your professional opinion, is it in the national security interest of the United States to support Ukraine with the much talked about military aid?
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Mr. Holmes?
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	We?ve already said it several times today and you?ve already testified that Ukraine is in war right now with Russia. Isn?t it true, Mr. Holmes, that even though the security assistance was eventually delivered to Ukraine, the fact that it was delayed to a country that is actively in war, signaled to Russia, that perhaps the bond between Ukraine and the United States was weakening?
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And even the appearance that the US/Ukraine bond is shaky could embolden Russia to act in an even more aggressive way?
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	You also testified that it was, and I quote, ?The unanimous view of the Ukraine policy community, that the aid should be released because supporting Ukraine is in our national security interests.? Dr. Hill, why do you believe that the entire Ukraine policy community were unanimously in agreement?
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Thank you so much, Dr. Hill. And Mr. Holmes, what kind of message does it potentially send to other allies of the United States when military holds for assistance are imposed with absolutely no explanation? What kind of message does it send to our allies in terms of the good faith and good relationship with the U.S.?
2019-11-21	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Policies change, but U.S. interests don?t, at least not for those true public servants who are committed and dedicated to protecting our nation. Thank you both for being two of them.
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Aye.
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a former law enforcement official, I know firsthand that the rule of law is the strength of our democracy and no one is above it, not our neighbors in our various communities, not our coworkers and not the President of the United States. Yet the president have said that he can not be prosecuted for criminal conduct, that he need not comply with Congressional requests and subpoenas. Matter of fact, the president is trying to absorb himself of any accountability. Since the beginning of the investigation in early September, the House sent multiple letters, document requests, and subpoenas to the White House. Yet the president has refused to produce documents and has directed others not to produce documents. He has prevented key White House officials from testifying. The president’s obstruction of Congress is pervasive. Since the House began its investigation, the White House has produced zero subpoenaed documents. In addition, at the president’s direction, more than a dozen members of his administration have defied Congressional subpoenas.
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	The following slides shows those who have refused to comply at the president’s direction. We are facing a categorical blockade by a president who’s desperate to prevent any investigation into his wrongdoing. Professor Gerhardt, has a president ever refused to cooperate in an impeachment investigation?
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And any president who … I know Nixon delayed or tried to delay turning over information. When that occurred, was it at the same level that we’re seeing today?
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Did Nixon’s obstruction result in an Article of Impeachment?
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Professor Feldman, is it fair to say that if a president stonewalls and investigation like we are clearly seeing today into whether he has committed an impeachable offense, he risks rendering the impeachment power moot?
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Professor Gerhardt, when a president prevents witnesses from complying with Congressional subpoenas, are we entitled to make any perceptions about what they would say if they testified?
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	In relation to what you just said, Ambassador Sondland testified and I quote, “Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.” Professor Gerhardt, how is Ambassador Sondland’s testimony relevant here?
2019-12-04	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Professors, I want to thank you for your testimony. The president used the power of his office to pressure a foreign head of state to investigate an American citizen in order to benefit his domestic political situation. After he was caught, and I do know something about that, this president proceeded to cover it up and refuse to comply with valid Congressional subpoenas. The framers included impeachment in the Constitution to ensure that no one, no one, is above the law, including and especially the President of the United States. Thank you Mr. Chair, and I yield back.
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, as a member of the intelligence committee, I saw significant first-hand evidence that President Trump conditioned our military aid on Ukraine announcing investigations into the 2016 election and the Bidens and betrayed our national security interests in the process. For example, Ambassador Sondland told us that once the Ukrainians found out about the aid being withheld, it was made and I quote, “Abundantly clear to them that if they wanted the aid,” and I quote, “They were going to have to make these statements.
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Mr. Goldman, beginning on and around the 25th of July call through September, would you agree that consistent with the testimony we just reviewed, Ukraine was made aware that to receive our military aid and the White House visit, that they were going to have to make a statement announcing the investigations?
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And by the end of August, President Zelensky did in fact commit to making that commitment on CNN. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	I’d like to direct your attention to the screen in front of you, which displays again a Washington Post article from September 5th. The headline says: “Trump tries to force Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 elections.” And the article reports that President Trump is, and I quote, “Attempting to force Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump is not just soliciting Ukraine’s help with his presidential campaign, he is using United States’ military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	So am I correct, Mr. Goldman, that by September 25th, allegations that President Trump was using military aid to pressure Ukraine to announce investigation was being widely reported?
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	September 5th.
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And by September 9th, our investigative committees formally announced a Congressional investigation into the President of these issues… into the President about these issues. And Mr. Goldman, what day did Trump release the military aid?
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	So then am I correct that as the timeline on the screen in front of you shows, it wasn’t until after the whistleblower complaint, after the Washington Post report, and after Congress launched the investigations that President Trump finally released the aid?
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And matter of fact, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified that people at the NSC in fact discussed that Congress’ investigation, “Might have the effect of releasing the hold on Ukraine’s military aid, because it would be potentially politically challenging to justify the aid.” Is that correct, Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	In other words, the aid was released after the President got caught. And what makes me angry is that this President, President Trump, thinks he can get away with it. But he got caught and he tried to cover it up. But we won’t let him do that, and we thank God, Mr. Goldman, for the true courageous public servants who came forward in spite of intimidation and obstruction from the White House. You see, everybody counts, but everybody is accountable, up to and including the President of the United States. Thank you, and I yield back.
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Thank you so much Mr. Chairman.
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	"Ambassador, everyone in this room should be thankful for your service to our nation. I have four little girls in my life; and as I sit here thinking about them, and as a woman, I cannot be prouder of you. And I consider you an inspiration for women around the world."
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	"I just have to say, before I get into my questioning, I think it’s disgraceful to hear my colleagues refer to your sworn testimony as a performance today, or speak in a condescending way, basically suggesting that “the woman”… because I think that’s how the President referred to you; I’m not sure he knows your name or there’s some other meaning there… but to basically suggest that “the woman should be thankful for whatever she was left with,” smear campaign and all, after you were recalled. But I want you to know today that we thank you for your service, your 33 years of service."
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Ambassador, on a press conference call on October 17th, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney discussed his belief that it’s entirely appropriate to politicize U.S. foreign policy. Here’s what he said: “If you read the news reports and you believe them, what did McKinley say yesterday? Well, McKinley said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy. That was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody: ‘Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.'
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Ambassador Yovanovitch, do you share the concern raised by Ambassador McKinley in testimony before this Committee about political influence in foreign policy?
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And what message do you think it sends to other foreign service officers in public service, which we so desperately need good ones, when an administration refuses to support its own officials in the face of a smear campaign?
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Morale issues at the State Department? I can understand why.
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	On March 20th of 2019, President Trump tweeted an article that included a letter from Representative Pete Sessions that said you had, and I quote, “spoken privately and repeatedly about your disdain for the current administration, in a way that might call for the expulsion of you as Ambassador to Ukraine, and immediately.
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Did you speak publicly and privately about your disdain for the Trump Administration?
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Why do you think the President would want to push such a lie?
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Policies change, but U.S. interests don’t, not for those who are seeking to do the work of protecting our nation, the work you have done for decades. The President, his Chief of Staff and his allies, seem to want nothing more than to smear the good people trying to protect this country and to hijack our institutions for their personal and political game.
0201-11-15	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Again, Ambassador, we thank you so much for your service and I’ll yield my remaining time to the chairman.
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Morrison, and to both of you, thank you so much for your service. Thanks for being here, it’s been a long day. Mr. Morrison, just to follow up on the question from my colleague, you responded earlier to a series of questions about the call and basically saw nothing wrong with it, yet you skipped your chain of command to go to legal counsel to find out, I guess to find out what to do because you were concerned about the political fall out, not about anything being inappropriate or wrong with the call? Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Okay, could you tell me why you felt the need? You saw nothing basically wrong with the call, yet you skipped your chain of command to go to counsel, because of what? What was the reason for that?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And who’s your direct report?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And the name of the person?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Okay, Dr. Cupperman. Did you speak with him before you spoke with legal counsel?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	But you don’t feel you skipped your chain of command in doing so, going directly to counsel?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And why were you so concerned about the legal advisor being aware of this call that you saw nothing basically wrong with the substance or content of the call?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And what is it that you wanted them to be aware of, specifically?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	What concerned you to the point where you wanted them to know what had transpired that you went directly to legal counsel to inform them of?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Didn’t you testify earlier that you were concerned about the political fall out based on the political climate in DC? Is that-
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Okay, all right. And so how long have you supervised Lieutenant Colonel Vindman?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Okay. All right, thank you. Ambassador Volker, you testified that you believe that Congressional pressure helped unfreeze the security assistance being released. Do you still stand by that testimony today?
0201-11-19	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield my remaining time to you.
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Mr. Kent, you said that a president has the right to remove an ambassador because the ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Does that removal usually come with a smear campaign of that ambassador by the president?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	You have any idea why it was important to discredit Ambassador Yovanovitch, what she was not willing to do or to do? Why that was important?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	The committee’s investigation has uncovered a web of shadow diplomacy, engaged in and executed by several State Department officials and the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and ultimately directed by President Trump. We have heard several ways of describing this shady shadow operation, shadow diplomacy, rogue back channel.
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor, you have described what you encountered as the top diplomat on the ground in Ukraine, as a, and I quote, “highly irregular informal channel of U.S. policy making.” You testified that the channel included Ambassador Volker, Sondland, Secretary Perry, and, as you later learned, the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Both of you have explained that you grew seriously concerned when you realized that the interests of this irregular channel diverge from official U.S. policy and interests. Was Mr. Giuliani promoting U.S. national interests or policy in Ukraine, Ambassador?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	What interests do you believe he was promoting, Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor? What interests do you believe he was promoting?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	The State Department’s role is to promote U.S. policies overseas, not to help the current president win reelection. Is that correct, Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	What is the risk of running a separate channel of diplomacy that is completely outside of normal channels and does not further U.S. policy goals, Ambassador Taylor?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor, you have described in your previous testimony, one instance shortly after you arrived in Ukraine, in which Ambassador Sondland asked State Department officials not to listen to a July 28th call he had planned to hold with President Zelinsky. Did you find that unusual?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	What was the impact of Ambassador Sondland making that request? You found it unusual, what did you believe the impact was?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Was there a recording or transcription?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	Do you think that’s why the request was made? So there would not be normal State Department employees from the operations center would have been there transcribing and taking notes.
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	So you know that the State Department is holding your notes and refuses to provide them to Congress despite a duly authorized subpoena, and we know that, in some instances, your notes may be the only documentary record of what happened. You are aware of that, correct?
2019-11-13	Val Demings	D-Demings	Democrat	And Mr. Kent, you are aware that your notes have not been turned over to Congress.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Thank you Chairman Adler, Ranking Member Collins, members of the judiciary committee. It’s an honor to appear before you today to discuss one of the most consequential functions you were given by the framers, and that is the impeachment of a president of the United States. 21 years ago, I sat before you, Chairman Adler, and this committee to testify at the impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton. I never thought that I would have to appear a second time to address the same question with regard to another sitting president. Yet here we are.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	The elements are strikingly similar. The intense rancor and rage of the public debate is the same. It’s the atmosphere that the framers anticipated. The stifling intolerance of opposing views is the same. I’d like to start therefore, perhaps incongruently, by stating an irrelevant fact. I’m not a supporter of President Trump. I voted against him.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	My personal views of President Trump are as irrelevant to my impeachment testimony as they should be to your impeachment vote. President Trump will not be our last president, and what we leave in the wake of this scandal will shape our democracy for generations to come. I’m concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger. I believe this impeachment not only fails to satisfy the standard of past impeachments, but would create a dangerous precedent for future impeachments.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	My testimony lays out the history of impeachment from early English cases, to colonial cases, to the present day. The early impeachments were raw political exercises using fluid definitions of criminal and non-criminal acts. When the framers met in Philadelphia, they were quite familiar with impeachment and its abuses, including the Hastings case, which was discussed in the convention, a case that was still pending for trial in England.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Unlike the English impeachments, the American model was more limited, not only in its application did judicial and executive officials, but its grounds. The framers rejected a proposal to add mail administration because Madison objected that so vague a term would be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	In the end, various standards that had been used in the past were rejected. Corruption, obtaining office by improper means, betraying the trust to a foreign power, negligence, perfidy, peculation and oppression. Perfidy or lying and peculation, self-dealing are particularly relevant to our current controversy. My testimony explores the impeachment cases of Nixon, Johnson and Clinton.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	The closest of these three cases is to the 1868 impeachment of Andrew Johnson. It is not a model or an association that this committee should relish. In that case, a group of opponents of the president’s called the Radical Republicans created a trapdoor crime in order to impeach the president. They even defined it as a high misdemeanor.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	There was another shared aspect, besides the atmosphere of that impeachment and also the unconventional style of the two presidents, and that shared element is speed. This impeachment would rival the Johnson impeachment as the shortest in history, depending on how one counts the relevant days. Now, there are three commonalities when you look at these past cases. All involved established crimes. This would be the first impeachment in history where there would be considerable debate, and in my view, not compelling evidence of the commission of a crime.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Second is the abbreviated period of this investigation, which is problematic and puzzling. This is a facially incomplete and inadequate record in order to impeach a president. Allow me to be candid in my closing remarks because we have limited time. We are living in the very period described by Alexander Hamilton, a period of agitated passions.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I get it, you’re mad. The president’s mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My wife is mad, my kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad, and Luna’s a golden doodle and they don’t get mad. So we’re all mad. Where’s that taken us?
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Will and a slip shot impeachment make us less mad? Will it only invite an invitation for the madness to follow every future administration? That is why this is wrong. It’s not wrong because President Trump is right. His call was anything but perfect. It’s not wrong because the house has no legitimate reason to investigate the Ukrainian controversy. It’s not wrong because we’re in an election year. There is no good time for an impeachment. No, it’s wrong because this is not how you impeach an American president.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	This case is not a case of the unknowable. It’s a case of the peripheral. We have a record of conflicts, defenses that have not been fully considered, un-subpoenaed witness with material evidence. To impeach a president on this record would expose every future president to the same type of inchoate impeachment. Principal often takes us to a place we would prefer not to be. That was the place seven Republicans found themselves in the Johnson trial, when they saved a president from acquittal that they despised. For generations they even celebrated his profiles of courage.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Senator Edmund Ross said it was like looking down into his open grave, and then he jumped because he didn’t have any alternative. It’s easy to celebrate those people from the distance of time and circumstance in the age of rage. It’s appealing to listen to those saying, forget the definitions of crimes, just do it. Like this is some impulse-buy Nike sneaker.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	You could certainly do that. You can declare the definitions of crimes alleged are immaterial and just an exercise of politics, not the law. However, those legal definitions and standards which I’ve addressed in my testimony, are the very thing that divide rage from reason.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	This all brings up to me, and I will conclude with this, of a scene from A Man For All Seasons by with Sir Thomas Moore. When his son-in-law, William Roper put the law … Suggested that Moore was putting the law ahead of morality. He said, “Moore would give the devil the benefit of the law.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	When Moore asks Roper, would he instead cut a great road through the law to get after the devil? Roper proudly declares, “Yes, I’d cut down every law of England to do that.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Moore responds, “And when the last law is cut down, and the devil turned around on you, where would you hide, Roper? All the laws being flat.” He said, “This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast, man’s laws, not God’s, and if you cut them down and you’re just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	And he finished by saying, “Yes, I’d give the devil the benefit of law for my own sake.” So I will conclude with this. Both sides of this controversy have demonized the other to justify any measure in their defense, much like Roper. Perhaps that’s the saddest part of all of this.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	We have forgotten the common article of faith that binds each of us to each other in our constitution. However, before we cut down the trees so carefully planted by the framers, I hope you will consider what you will do when the wind blows again, perhaps for a democratic president. Where will you stand then, when all the laws being flat? Thank you, again, for the honor of testifying today, and I’d be happy to answer any questions.  Michael Gerhardt Opening Statement
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s true, but I also added an important caveat. First of all-
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s, you’ve read it well.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, it’s a challenge to think of anything I was not able to cover in my robust exchange with majority of council. But I’d like to try.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	There’s a couple of things I just wanted to highlight. I’m not going to take a great deal of time. I respect my colleagues, I know all of them, and I consider them friends and I certainly respect what they have said today. We have fundamental disagreements. And I’d like to start with the issue of bribery. The statement has been made, and not just by these witnesses, but chairman Schiff and others that this is a clear case of bribery. It’s not.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	And chairman Schiff said that it might not fit today’s definition of bribery, but it would fit the definition back in the 18th century. Now putting aside Mr. Schiff’s turn towards originalism, I think that it might come as a relief to him and his supporters that his career will be a short one. That there is not an originalist future in that argument.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	The bribery theory, being put forward, is as flawed in the 18th century as it is in this century. The statement that was made by one of my esteemed colleagues is that a bribery really wasn’t defined until much later. There was no bribery statute and that is certainly true. But it obviously had a meaning. That’s why they put it in this important standard. Bribery was not this overarching concept that chairman Schiff indicated. Quite to the contrary, the original standard was treason and bribery that led Mason to object that it was too narrow.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	If robbery could include any time you did anything for personal interest instead of public interest. If you have this overarching definition, that exchange would have been completely useless. The framers didn’t disagree with Mason’s view that bribery was too narrow. What they disagreed with was when he suggested maladministration to add to the standard, because he wanted it to be broader.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	And what James Madison said is that that’s too broad that that would essentially create what you might call a vote of no confidence in England. It would basically allow Congress to toss out a president that they did not like. But once again, we’re all channeling the intent of the framers and that’s always a dangerous thing to do. The only more dangerous spot to stand in is between Congress and an impeachment as an academic.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	But I would offer instead the words of the framers themselves. You see, in that exchange, they didn’t just say bribery was too narrow. They actually gave an example of bribery. And it was nothing like what was described. When the objection was made by Mason… I’m sorry, by Madison, ultimately, the framers agreed. And then Morris, who was referred to earlier, did say we need to adopt this standard. But well, what was left out was what came afterwards.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	What Morris said is that we need to protect against bribery because we don’t want anything like what happened with Louis the 14th and Charles the second. That is, the example he gave of bribery was accepting actual money as the head of state. So what had happened in that example that Morris gave as his example of bribery was that Louis the 14th, who was a bit of a recidivist when it came to bribes, gave Charles the second a huge amount of money as well as other benefits, including apparently a French mistress in exchange for the Secret Treaty of Dover of 1670.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	It also was an exchange for his converting to the Catholicism. But that wasn’t some broad notion of bribery, it was actually quite narrow. So I don’t think that dog will hunt in the 18th century. And I don’t think it will hunt today. Because if you take a look at the 21st century, bribery is well defined. And you shouldn’t just take our word for it, you should look to how it’s defined by the United States Supreme Court.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	In a case called McDonald versus the United States, the Supreme Court looked at a public corruption bribery case. This was a case where gifts were actually received, benefits were actually extended, there was completion. This was not some hypothetical of a crime that was not fulfilled or an action that was not actually taken. The Supreme court unanimously overturned that conviction, unanimously. And what they said was that, you cannot take the bribery crime and use what they called a boundless interpretation.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	All the justices said that it’s a dangerous thing to take a crime like bribery and apply a boundless interpretation. They rejected the notion, for example, that bribery could be used in terms of setting up meetings and other types of things that occur in the course of a public service career. So what I would caution the committee is that these crimes have meaning. It gives me no joy to disagree with my colleagues here. And I really don’t have a dog in this fight. But you can’t accuse a president of bribery.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	And then when some of us know that the Supreme Court has rejected your type of boundless interpretation, say, well, it’s just impeachment, we really don’t have to prove the elements. That’s a favorite mantra that is sort of close enough for jazz.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, this is an improvisational jazz. Close enough is not good enough. If you’re going to accuse a president of bribery, you need to make it stick, because you’re trying to remove a duly elected president of the United States. Now, it’s unfair to accuse someone of a crime and when others say, “Well, those interpretations you’re using to define the crime are not valid, and to say, they don’t have to be valid.” Because this is impeachment. That has not been the standard historically.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	My testimony lays out the criminal allegations in the previous impeachments. Those were not just proven crimes, they were accepted crimes. That is, even the Democrats on that judiciary committee agreed that Bill Clinton had committed perjury. That’s on the record. And a federal judge later said it was perjury. In the case of Nixon, the crimes were established. No one seriously disagreed with those crimes.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Now Johnson [inaudible 01:20:19] because Johnson was a trapdoor crime. They basically created a crime knowing that Johnson wanted to replace secretary of war stamp. And Johnson did. Because they had serious trouble in the cabinet. So they created a trapdoor crime, waited for him to fire the secretary of war, and then they impeached him. But there’s no question he committed the crime. It’s just the underlying statute was unconstitutional.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	So I would caution you only about bribery but also obstruction. I’m sorry, ranking member, you…
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I’d also caution you about obstruction. Obstruction is a crime also with meaning. It has elements. It has controlling case authority. The record does not establish obstruction in this case. That is, what my steam colleagues said was certainly true. If you accept all of their presumptions, it would be obstruction. But impeachments have to be based on proof, not presumptions.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s the problem. When you move towards impeachment on this abbreviated schedule that has not been explained to me, why you want to set the record for the fastest impeachment. Fast is not good for impeachment. Narrow fast impeachments have failed. Just ask Johnson. So the obstruction issue is an example of this problem. And here’s my concern. The theory being put forward is that president Trump obstructed Congress by not turning over material requested by the committee. And citations have been made to the third article of the Nixon impeachment.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Now first of all, I want to confess. I’ve been a critic of the third article, the Nixon impeachment my whole life. My hair catches on fire every time someone mentions the third article. Why? Because you would be replicating one of the worst articles written on impeachment. Here’s the reason why. Peter Rodino’s position as chairman of judiciary was that Congress alone decides what information may be given to it, alone.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	His position was that the courts have no role in this. And so, by that theory, any refusal by a president based on executive privilege or immunities would be the basis of impeachment. That is essentially the theory that’s being replicated today. President Trump has gone to the courts. He’s allowed to do that. We have three branches, not two. I happen to agree with some of your criticism about president Trump, including that earlier quote where my colleagues talked about his saying that there’s this article two. And he gives us overriding interpretation.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I share that criticism. You’re doing the same thing with article one. You’re saying article one gives us complete authority that when we demand information from another branch, it must be turned over or we’ll impeach you in record time. Now making that worse is that you have such a short investigation. It’s a perfect storm. You set an incredibly short period, demand a huge amount of information, and when the president goes to court, you then impeach him. Now, does that track with what you’ve heard about impeachment? Does that track with the rule of law that we’ve talked about?
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	And obstruction, I would encourage you to think about this. In Nixon, it did go to the courts. And Nixon lost. And that was the reason Nixon resigned. He resigned a few days after the Supreme Court ruled against him in that critical case. But in that case, the court recognize there are executive privilege arguments that can be made. It didn’t say, “You had no right coming to us. Don’t darken our doorstep again.” It said, “We’ve heard your arguments. We’ve heard Congress’s arguments. And you know what? You lose. Turn over the material to Congress.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	You know, what that did for the judiciary is it gave this body legitimacy. It wasn’t the Rodino extreme position that only you decide what information can be produced. Now recently, there’s some rulings against president Trump, including a ruling involving Don McGahn. Mr. Chairman, I testified in front of you a few months ago. And if you recall, we had an exchange and I encouraged you to bring those actions. And I said, I thought you would win. And you did.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	And I think it was an important win for this committee, because I don’t agree with president Trump’s argument in that case. But that’s an example of what can happen, if you actually subpoena witnesses and go to court. Then you have an obstruction case because of court issues and order. And unless they stay that order by a higher court, you have obstruction. But I can’t emphasize this enough and I’ll say just one more time. If you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It’s your abuse of power. You are doing precisely what you’re criticizing the president for doing.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	We have a third branch that deals with conflicts of the other two branches. And what comes out of there and what you do with it is the very definition of legitimacy.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yeah. It came out unanimous. So did a couple of the other cases I cite in my testimony, which also refute these criminal theories.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I think so. And part of the problem is that to bring a couple of these articles, you have to contradict the position of president Obama. President Obama withheld evidence from Congress in fast and furious, an investigation a rather more ironic program that led to the death of a federal agent. President Obama gave a sweeping argument that he was not only not going to give evidence to this body, but that a court had absolutely no role in determining whether he could withhold the evidence.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yeah, I think that president Obama has invoked too broadly. But on the other hand, he has actually released a lot of information. I’ve been friends with Bill Barr for a long time. We disagree on executive privilege. I’m a Madisonian scholar. I tend to favor Congress in disputes. And he is the inverse. His natural default is article two. My natural default is article one. But he actually has released more privileged information than any attorney general in my lifetime, including the Mueller report. These transcripts of these calls would be core executive privilege material. There’s no question about that.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yeah, fast and narrow is not a good recipe for impeachment. That’s the case with Johnson. Narrow was the case with Clinton. They tend not to survive. They tend to collapse in front of the Senate. Impeachments are like buildings. There’s a ratio between your foundation and your height. And this is the highest structure you can build under the constitution. You want to build an impeachment, you have to have a foundation broad enough to support it. This is the narrowest impeachment in history. You could argue with Johnson.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Johnson, it might be actually be the fastest impeachment. Johnson actually was… What happened to Johnson was actually the fourth impeachment attempt against Johnson. And actually the record goes back a year before. They laid that trapdoor a year before. So it was not as fast as it might appear.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	It does. There’s a reason why every past impeachment has established crimes. And it’s obvious. It’s not that you can’t impeach on a non crime. You can. And In fact, non crimes have been part of past impeachments. It’s just that they’ve never gone up alone or primarily as the basis of impeachment. That’s the problem here. If you prove a quid pro quo, you might have an impeachable offense. But to go up only on a noncriminal case will be the first time in history. So why is that the case?
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	The reason is that crimes have an established definition and case law. So there’s a concrete independent body of law that assures the public that this is not just political, that this is a president who did something they could not do. You can’t say the president is above the law. If you then say the crimes you accused them of really don’t have to be established.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, certainly, that has proven to be the case. It certainly of the two impeachments that we have seen. It’s also important to note by the way, that we often think that our times are unique. This provision wasn’t just written for times like ours, it was written in times like ours. It is, you know, these are people that were even more severe than the rhetoric today. I mean you have to keep in mind, Jefferson referred to the administration of the federalist as the reign of the witches.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	So this was not a period where people didn’t have the strong feelings. And indeed, when people talk about members of this committee acting like they want to kill each other, back then, they were actually trying to kill each other. That’s what the sedition law was, is you were trying to kill people that disagreed with you.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	But what’s notable is, they didn’t have a whole slew of impeachments. They knew not to do it. And I think that that’s a lesson that actually can be taken from that period. That the framers created a standard that would not be endlessly fluid and flexible. And that standard has kept us from impeachment despite periods in which we have really despised each other. And that I think is the most distressing thing for most of us today, is there’s so much more rage than reason.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	You can’t even talk about these issues without people saying you must be in favor of the Ukrainians taking over the country or the Russians moving into the White House. At some point, as a people, we have to have a serious discussion about the grounds to remove a duly elected president.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, I believe that the founders certainly had aspirations that we would come together as a people, but they didn’t have any delusions. It certainly was not something that they achieved in their own lifetime, although you’d be surprised that some of these framers actually did at the ends of their lives, including Jefferson and Adams, sort of reconcile indeed. I think one of the most weighty and significant moments in constitutional history is the one that is rarely discussed that Adams and Jefferson reached out to each other, that they wanted to reconcile before they died, and they met and they did.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	And maybe that is something that we can learn from, but I think that the greater thing I would point to is the seven Republicans in the Johnson impeachment. If I could just read one thing to you and everyone often talks about one of the senators, but not this one, and that’s Lyman Trumbull, who was a fantastic Senator. He became a great advocate for civil liberties. You have to understand that most of these senators, when it was said that they jumped into their political graves, it was true. Most of their political careers ended.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	They knew they would end because of the animosity of the period. Trumbull said the following. He said, “Once this set the example of impeaching a president for what when the excitement of the hour shall have subsided will be regarded as insufficient causes. No future president will be safe who happens to differ from the majority of the House and 2/3 of the Senate.” He said, “I tremble for the future of my country. I cannot be an instrument to produce such a result and at the hazard of the ties even a friendship and affection until calmer times shall do justice to my motives. No alternatives are left to me.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	And he proceeded to give the vote that ended his career. You can’t wait for calmer times. The time for you is now, and I would say that what Trumbull said has even more bearing today because I believe that this is much like the Johnson impeachment. It’s manufactured until you build a record. I’m not saying you can’t build a record, but you can’t do it like this and you can’t impeach a president like this.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Not on this schedule. The one thing, if you look at, I laid out the three impeachments, the one thing that comes out of those impeachments in terms of what bipartisan support occurred is that impeachments require a certain period of saturation and maturation. That is the public has to catch up. I’m not prejudging what your record would show, but if you rush this impeachment, you’re going to leave half the country behind, and certainly that’s not what the framers wanted. You have to give the time to build a record. This isn’t an impulse buy item.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	You’re trying to remove a duly elected president of the United States and that takes time. It takes work. But at the end, if you look at Nixon, which was the gold standard in this respect, the public did catch up. They originally did not support impeachment, but they changed their mind. You changed their mind and so did, by the way, the courts, because you allow these issues to be heard in the courts.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes. I’ve gone through all of the crimes mentioned they do not meet any reasonable interpretation of those crimes and I’m relying on express statements from the federal courts. I understand that the language and the statutes are often broad. That’s not the controlling language. It’s the language of the interpretation of federal courts and I think that all of those decisions stand mightily in the way of these theories. And if you can’t make out those crimes, then don’t call it that crime. If it doesn’t matter, then what’s the point? Call it treason, call it endangered species violations if none of this matters.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	It did. I mean if you compare this to the extradition clause, the language that was used was different for a reason. They did not want to establish a type of broad meeting. According to the view of some people as to the meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors, those provisions would be essentially identical and that’s clearly not what they wanted.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	It is.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s correct.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	No, and that’s one of the reasons why if you want to establish the opposing view, you have to investigate this further.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I do. By considerable measure.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I think that that’s clear because this is one of the fitness records ever to go forward on impeachment. I mean the Johnson record once again we can debate because that was the fourth attempt at an impeachment, but this is certainly the thinnest of a modern record. If you take a look at the size of the record of Clinton and Nixon, they were massive in comparison to this, which is almost wafer thin in comparison and it has left doubts. Not just in doubts in the minds of people supporting President Trump, doubts in the minds of people like myself about what actually occurred.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	There’s a difference between requesting investigations and a quid pro quo. You need to stick the landing on the quid pro quo. You need to get the evidence to support it. It might be out there, I don’t know, but it’s not in this record. I agree with my colleagues. We’ve all read the record and I just come to a different conclusion. I don’t see proof of a quid pro quo no matter what my presumptions, assumptions or bias might be.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	It is. And the interesting thing is on the English impeachment model that was rejected by the framers, they took the language but they actually rejected the model of the impeachment from England, particularly in terms of Hastings. But even in England, it was a robust adversarial process. If you want to see adversarial work, take a look at what Edmund Burke did to Warren Hastings. I mean he was on him like ugly on moose for the entire trial.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yeah. The only reason I mentioned that is that was in a portion of my testimony dealing how you structure these impeachments. What happened during the Clinton impeachment and it came up during the hearing that we had previously. I was a question of how much the House had to do in terms of Clinton impeachment because you had this robust record created by the independent counsel and they had a lot of testimony, video tapes, etc. So the House basically incorporated that and the assumption was that those witnesses would be called at the Senate, but there was a failure at the Senate.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	The rules that were applied in my view, were not fair. They restricted witnesses to only three and that’s why I brought up the Lewinsky matter. About a year ago, Monica Lewinsky revealed that she had been told that if she signed that affidavit that we now know is untrue, that she would not be called as a witness. If you had actually called live witnesses, that type of information would have been part of the record.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, first of all, only I will speak for James Madison. No, no, we all will speak for James Madison with about the same level of accuracy. It’s a form of necromancy that academics do all the time and that’s what we get paid for. But I just want to note a couple of things. First of all, I do find it rather surprising that you would have George Washington in this jury pool. I would strike him for cause. George Washington was the first guy to raise extreme executive privilege claims. He had a rather robust view of what a president could say.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	If you were going to make a case to George Washington that you could impeach over a conversation he had with another head of state, I expect his hair, his powdered hair would catch on fire. Also, I just want to note one other thing and I am impressed with carrying an 18th century copy of Samuel Johnson with you.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Just the online version you. As an academic, I was pretty darn impressed. I just want to note one thing, which may explain part of our difference. The statutes today on bribery are written broadly just like they were back then. That was my point. The meaning of those words are subject to interpretation. They’re written broadly because they don’t want them to be too narrow. That was the case in the 18th century as they are today, but the idea that bad practices could be the definition of bribery. Really? Is that what you get from the Constitutional Convention that they had practices?
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Is that why Mason wanted to put in maladministration because bad practices is not broad enough? This is where I disagree. Now the other thing that I just wanted to note is and I have so much respect for Noah and I’m going to just disagree on this point. I feel it is a rather circular argument to say, well, The Constitution is law. Upon that we are in agreement, but The Constitution refers to a crime to say, well, you can’t trump The Constitution because it defines the crime. It doesn’t define the crime. It references the crime. Now the crime, the examples were given during the Constitutional Convention and those do not comport with bad practices.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	They comport with real bribery. But to say that the Supreme Court’s decision on what constitutes bribery is somehow irrelevant is rather odd. What The Constitution contains is a reference to a crime and then we have to decide if that crime has been committed.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Grammatically, yes. Constitutionally, it really depends on the context. I think your point is a good one in a sense that we have to determine from the transcript and hopefully from other witnesses whether this statement was part of an actual quid pro quo. I guess the threshold question is, if the president said, “I’d like you to do these investigations,” and by the way, I don’t group them together. In my testimony, I distinguish between the requests for investigations into 2016, from the investigation of the Bidens. But it is an issue of order. The magnitude of order, constitutionally, if you ask, I’d like you see you do this as opposed to “I have a quid pro quo. You either do this or you don’t get military aid.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Not the way it’s been stated. In fact, there’s so many different standards-
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, there’s been so many different standards. One of them was attempting to abuse office.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I’m not even sure how to recognize that, let alone define it.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	It sweeps pretty broadly, so I assume so.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, I can’t exclude anything under that definition.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I think it all would be subsumed into it.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Once again, I can’t exclude it.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	It would seem to be falling within it.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I’m afraid you have to direct it to others, but I don’t see any exclusions under their definition.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, not according to my definition, but the others will have to respond to their own.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I have a hard time excluding anything out of-
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Oh, it could be under that definition.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I would hope to God James Madison would escape. Otherwise, a lifetime of academic work would be shredded. But, once again, I can’t exclude many of these acts.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well when you’re graphic says in your ABC’s that your B is betrayal of national interest, I would simply ask, do you really want that to be your standard?
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Actually, I live in an ivory tower in a swamp, because I’m at GW, but… And it’s not so bad.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes. More importantly, the Supreme Court is focused on that issue as well as what is the definition of a quid pro quo.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	He doesn’t. And that’s the reason we keep on hearing the word circumstantial and inferential, and that’s what is so concerning is that those would be appropriate terms… It’s not that you can’t have a circumstantial case. Those would be appropriate terms if these were unknowable facts. But the problem is that you have so many witnesses that have not been subpoenaed. So many witnesses that we’ve not heard from.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Correct.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I did, and let me be very clear about this. I don’t disagree with my colleagues that nothing in the constitution says you have to go to a court or wait for a court. That’s not what I’m saying. What I’m saying is that if you want a well based, legitimate impeachment case, to set this abbreviated schedule, demand documents, and then impeach because they haven’t been turned over, so when they go to a court when the president goes to a court, I think that is an abuse of power. That’s not what happened in Nixon. And, in fact, the ultimate decision in Nixon was that there are legitimate executive privilege claims that could be raised, and some of them deal with the type of aides involved in this case, like a national security advisor, like a White House counsel. And so, the concern here is not that you can’t ever impeach a president unless you go to court. It’s just that you shouldn’t when you have time to do it.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Not on this record.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes, I would. First of all, what was said in that column is exactly what I’ve said in my testimony. The problem is not that abuse of power can never be an impeachable offense. You just have to prove it, and you haven’t. It’s not enough to say, I infer this was the purpose. I infer that this is what was intended when you’re not actually subpoenaing people with direct knowledge, and instead you’re saying we must vote in this rocket docket of an impeachment.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Gentlelady yields back.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s not my intention, sir.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I did indeed.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, what concerns me the most is that there are no limiting principles that I can see in some of the definitions that my colleagues have put forward. And more importantly, some of these impeachable offenses I’ve only heard about today. I’m not too sure what attempting to abuse office means or how you recognize it, but I’m pretty confident that nobody on this committee truly wants the new standard of impeachment to be betrayal of the national interest. But that is going to be the basis for impeachment?
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	How many Republicans do you think would say that Barack Obama violated that standard? That’s exactly what James Madison warned you against, is that you would create effectively a vote of no confidence standard in our Constitution.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, this is part of the problem of how your view of the President can affect your assumptions, your inferences, your view of circumstantial evidence. I’m not suggesting that the evidence, if it was fully investigated, would come out one way or the other. What I’m saying is that we are not dealing with the realm of the unknowable. You have to ask. We’ve burned two months in this House. Two months that you could have been in court seeking a subpoena for these witnesses. It doesn’t mean you have to wait forever, but you could have gotten an order by now. You could have allowed the President to raise an executive privilege.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Well, obviously there’s checks and balances on all of these, but the executive authority primarily obviously rests with the President, but these are all shared powers and I don’t begrudge the investigation of the Ukraine controversy. I think it was a legitimate investigation. What I begrudge is how it has been conducted.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s commonly expressed that way, yeah.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes, but this is where I think we would depart. I’ve been critical of the President in terms of crossing lines with the Justice Department. I think that has caused considerable problems. I also don’t believe it’s appropriate. But we often confuse what is inappropriate with what’s impeachable. Many people feel that what the President has done is obnoxious, contemptible, but contemptible is not synonymous with impeachable.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s what I’m referring to is unexplored defenses. Part of the bias when you look at these facts is you just ignore defenses. You say, “Well, those are just invalid.” But they’re the defenses. They’re the other side’s account for actions, and that’s what hasn’t been explored.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	With all due respect to Chairman, I do not believe that those factors were satisfied.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Only this. I think that one of the disagreements that we have and I have with my esteemed colleagues, is what makes a legitimate impeachment, not what technically satisfies an impeachment, there’s very few technical requirements of an impeachment. The question is, what is expected of you? And my objection is that there is a constant preference for inference over information, for presumptions over proof. That’s because this record hasn’t been developed. And if you’re going to remove a president … If you believe in democracy, if you’re going to remove a sitting president, then you have an obligation not to rely on inference when there’s still information you could gather. And that’s what I’m saying. It’s not that you can’t do this, you just can’t do it this way.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ve been a critic of the obstruction theory behind the Russian investigation because once again, it doesn’t meet what I think are the clear standards for obstruction. There were 10 issues that Mueller addressed. The only one that I think that raised a serious issue, quite frankly, was the matter with Don McGahn. There’s a disagreement about that. But also the Department of Justice rejected the obstruction of justice claim and it was not just the attorney general. It was also the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes. Various officials did testify and they are remaining in federal employment.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s correct.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I believe that.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I have, yes.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes, I am.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	That’s where I’m not sure I can answer that affirmatively. President Nixon in fact went to court over access to information documents and the like and he lost.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I agree with that.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	Yes, I do.
2019-12-04	Jonathan Turley	Expert	Expert	I think it’s true. The fact is that this was reviewed by main justice. The Special Counsel did not reach a conclusion on obstruction. He should have. I think that his justification quite frankly, was a bit absurd on not reaching a conclusion, but the deputy attorney general did and they came to the right conclusion. I don’t think this is a real case for obstruction, but then this body would be impeaching the president on the basis of the inverse conclusion. I don’t believe it’d be appropriate.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ranking member, other distinguished members of the committee. It’s an honor and a privilege to join the other distinguished witnesses to discuss a matter of grave concern to our country, and our constitution. Because this house, The People’s House has the sole power of impeachment. There is no better forum to discuss the constitutional standard for impeachment and whether that standard has been met in the case of the current President of the United States.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	As I explained in the remainder and balance of my opening statement, the record compiled thus far shows the president has committed several impeachable offenses including bribery, abuse of power, and soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader to benefit himself personally, obstructing justice, and obstructing Congress. Our hearing today should serve as a reminder of one of the fundamental principles that drove the founders of our constitution to break from England, and to draft their own constitution. The principle that in this country, no one is king.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	We have followed that principles since before the founding of the constitution, and it is recognized around the world as a fixed, inspiring American ideal. In his third message to Congress in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt delivered one of the finest articulations of this principle. He said, “No one is above the law and no man is below, nor do we ask any man’s permission when we require him to obey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right, not asked for as a favor.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Three features of our constitution protect the fundamental principle that no one, not even the president is above the law. First, in the British system, the public had no choice over the monarch who rule them. In our constitution, the framers allowed elections to serve as a crucial means for ensuring presidential accountability. Second, in the British system, the king could do no wrong, and no other parts of the government could check his misconduct. In our constitution, the framers developed the concept of separation of powers, which consists of checks and balances designed to prevent any branch, including the presidency, from becoming tyrannical.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Third in the British system, everyone but the king was impeachable. Our framers generation pledged their lives and fortunes to rebel against a monarch whom they saw as corrupt, tyrannical, and entitled to do no wrong. In our Declaration of Independence, the framers set forth a series of impeachable offenses that the king had committed against the American colonists. When the framers later convened in Philadelphia to draft our constitution, they were united around a simple, indisputable principle that was a major safeguard for the public. We the people, against tyranny of any kind. The people who had overthrown a king, we’re not going to turn around just after securing their independence from corrupt monarchial tyranny, and create an office that like the king was above the law and could and could do no wrong.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	The framers created a chief executive to bring energy to their administration of federal laws, but to be accountable to Congress for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The framers concern about the need to protect against a corrupt president was evident throughout the convention. And here, I must thank my prior two friends who have spoken and referred to a North Carolinian, William Davy. I will refer to another North Carolinian in the Constitutional Convention. James Iredale, whom president Washington later appointed to the Supreme court assured his fellow delegates. The president quote, “Is of a very different nature from a Monarch. He is to be personally responsible for any abuse of the great trust placed in him.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	This brings us of course to the crucial question we’re here to talk about today. The standard for impeachment. The Constitution defines treason, and the term bribery basically means using office for personal gain. Or I should say misusing office for personal gain. And his Professor Feldman pointed out, these terms derive from the British, who understood the class of cases that would be impeachable to refer to political crimes. Which included great offenses against the United States, attempts to subvert The Constitution when the president deviates from his duty, or dares to abuse the power invested in him by the people, breaches the public trust, and serious injuries to the Republic.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	In his influential essay in The Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton declared that, “Impeachable offenses are those offenses which proceeded from the misconduct of public men, or in other words, the abuse or violation of some public trust. And relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to a society itself.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Several themes emerge from the framers discussion of the scope of impeachable offenses and impeachment practice. We know that not all impeachable offenses are criminal, and we know that not all felonies are impeachable offenses. We know further that what matters in determining whether particular misconduct constitutes a high crime and misdemeanor is ultimately the context, and the gravity of the misconduct in question.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	After reviewing the evidence that’s been made public, I can not help but conclude that this president has attacked each of the constitutions safeguards against establishing a monarchy in this country. Both the context and gravity of the president’s misconduct are clear. The favor he requested from Ukraine’s president was to receive, in exchange for his use of presidential power, Ukraine’s announcement of a criminal investigation of a political rival. The investigation was not the important action for the president, the announcement was. Because it could then be used in this country to manipulate the public into casting aside the president’s political rival because of concerns about his corruption.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	The gravity of the president’s misconduct is apparent when we compare it to the misconduct of the one president resigned from office to avoid impeachment, conviction and removal. The House Judiciary Committee in 1974 approved three articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon, who resigned a few days later. The first article charged him with obstruction of justice. If you read The Mueller Report, it identifies a number of facts, I won’t lay them out here right now, that suggest the president himself has obstructed justice.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	If you look at the second article of impeachment approved against Richard Nixon, it charged him with abuse of power for ordering the heads of the FBI, IRS, and CIA to harass his political enemies. In the present circumstance, The President is engaged in a pattern of abusing the trust, placing him by the American people, by soliciting foreign countries, including China, Russia, and Ukraine, to investigate his political opponents and interfere on his behalf in elections in which he is a candidate.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	The third article approved against president Nixon charged that he had failed to comply with four legislative subpoenas. In the present circumstance. The president has refused to comply with and directed at least 10 others in his administration not to comply with lawful congressional subpoenas. Including Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and acting Chief of Staff and Head of the office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	As Senator Lindsey Graham, now Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee said, when he was a member of The House on the verge of impeaching President Clinton, the day Richard Nixon failed to answer that subpoena, is the day he was subject to impeachment. Because he took the power from Congress over the impeachment process away from Congress, and he became the judge and jury. That is a perfectly good articulation of why obstruction of Congress is impeachable. The president’s defiance of Congress is all in the more troubling due to the rationale he claims for his obstruction.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	His arguments and those of his subordinates, including his White House counsel, in his October 8th letter to The Speaker and three committee chairs boil’s down to the assertion that he is above the law. I won’t reread that letter here, but I do want to disagree with the characterization in the letter of these proceedings. Since The Constitution expressly says, and The Supreme Court has unanimously affirmed that The House has the sole power of impeachment and that like the Senate, The House has the power to determine the rules for its proceedings.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	The president and his subordinates have argued further that the president is entitled to absolute immunity from criminal procedure, even an investigation for any criminal wrongdoing, including shooting someone on 5th Avenue. The president has claimed further, he’s entitled to an absolute executive privilege, not to share any information he doesn’t want to share with another branch. He’s also claimed the entitlement to be able to order the executive branch, as he’s done, not to cooperate with this body when it conducts an investigation of the president.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	If left unchecked, The president will likely continue his pattern of soliciting foreign interference on behalf of the next election, and of course his obstruction of Congress. The fact that we can easily transpose the articles of impeachment against President Nixon onto the actions of this president speaks volumes. And that does not even include the most serious national security concerns, and election interference concerns, at the heart of this president’s misconduct.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	No misconduct is an antithetical to our democracy, and nothing injures the American people more than a president uses his power to weaken their authority under The Constitution as well as the authority of The Constitution itself. May I read one more sentence, or… I’m sorry.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Thank you. If Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning. And along with that, our Constitution has carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil, and therefore, I stand with The Constitution, and I stand with the framers who were committed to ensure that no one is above the law.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	When a President does that, separation of powers means nothing. The subpoenas that have been issued, of course, are lawful orders. In our law schools, we would teach our students, this is an easy, straightforward situation. You comply with the law. Lawyers, all the time, have to comply with subpoenas. In this situation, the full-scale obstruction, full-scale obstruction of those subpoenas, I think torpedoes separation of powers. Therefore, your only recourse is to, in a sense, protect your institutional prerogatives, and that would include impeachment.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Absolutely. Yes, sir.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	We three are unanimous, yes.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	No, it plainly does not. Everything we know about the history of impeachment reinforces the conclusion that impeachable offenses do not have to be crimes, and again, not all crimes are impeachable offenses. We look at, again, at the context and gravity of the misconduct.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Correct.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Well, I have a lot of thoughts. One of them is that what we haven’t mentioned yet and brought into this conversation is the fact that the impeachment power requires this Committee, this House to be able to investigate Presidential misconduct. If a President can block an investigation, undermine it, stop it, then the impeachment power itself, as a check against misconduct, is undermined completely.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes, I do.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I, of course, agree with Professor Karlan and Professor Feldman. And I just want to stress that if what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable. This is precisely the misconduct that the Framers created a Constitution including impeachment to protect against. If there’s no action… If Congress concludes they’re going to give a pass to the president here, as Professor Karlan suggested earlier, every other president will say, “Okay, then I can do the same thing,” and the boundaries will just evaporate. Those boundaries are set up by the Constitution, and we may be witnessing, unfortunately, their erosion. That is a danger to all of us.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Precisely what you’re doing.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I certainly would agree with what’s been said. One of the things to understand from the history of impeachment is everybody who was impeached has failed. They failed to get what they wanted. What they wanted was not just to do what they did, but to get away with it.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	The point of impeachment, and it’s made possible through investigation, is to catch that person, charge that person, and ultimately remove that person from office. But impeachments are always focusing on somebody who didn’t quite get as far as they wanted to.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	It’s as… Nobody’s better than Professor Karlan at hypotheticals, but I’ll dare to raise yet another one. Imagine a bank robbery. The police come and the person’s in the middle of a bank robbery. The person then drops the money and says, “I am going to leave without the money.” Everybody understands that’s robbery… I mean, that’s burglary. I’ll get it right. In this situation, we’ve got somebody really caught in the middle of it. That doesn’t excuse the person from the consequences.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I think there’s more than enough. As I mentioned in my statement, just to really underscore this, the third article of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee against President Nixon charged him with misconduct because he had failed to comply with four legislature subpoenas.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Here it is far more than four that this president has failed to comply with. And he’s ordered the executive branch as well, not to cooperate with Congress. Those, together with a lot of other evidence, suggest obstruction of Congress.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I read that report last night after I had submitted my statement, but I had watched and read all the other transcripts that were available. The report that was issued reinforces everything else that came before it. So yes.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes, I have.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Well, based on… So I’ve come here like every other witness, assuming the facts that have been put together in official reports. The Mueller report cites a number of facts that indicate the president of United States obstructed justice. That’s an impeachable offense.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	That is correct.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	That’s correct.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir, I did.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Both individually and collectively, these are evidence of obstruction of justice.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	It is quite serious, and that’s not all of it, of course. We know, as you’ve mentioned before, and others have mentioned, obstruction of justice has been recognized an impeachable offense, both against President Clinton and President Nixon. This evidence that’s been put forward by Mr. Mueller, that’s in the public record, is very strong evidence of obstruction of justice.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes. On obstruction of justice, one thing I want to emphasize is obstructing justice is not just about obstruction of a court. It’s obstruction of any lawful proceeding and so that obstruction isn’t limited to whatever is happening on the courts. And obviously here, there are judicial proceedings going on, but there’s also a really critical congressional proceeding, which brings us to obstruction of Congress. With the obstruction in Congress, I don’t think, in fact, I can say, I know there’s never been anything like the president’s refusal to comply with with subpoenas from this body.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	These are lawful subpoenas. These have the force of law to them. These are the things that every other president has complied with and actually acted in alignment with except for President Nixon in a small but significant set of materials.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I’m sorry, I missed part of the question. Please. I’m sorry.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I have to respectfully disagree. No, his refusal to comply with those subpoenas is an independent event. It’s apart from the courts. It’s a direct assault on the legitimacy of this inquiry, which is crucial to the exercise of this power.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I certainly would agree with professor Karlan. Yes. I think the difficulty here is we need to remember that impeachable offenses don’t have to be criminal offenses, as you well know. And so what we’re talking about is an abuse of power. We’re talking about an abuse of power that only the president can commit and there was a systematic concerted effort by the president to remove people that would somehow obstruct or block his ability to put that pressure on Ukraine to get an announcement of an investigation. That seems to be what he cared about.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes sir.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I agree with what my colleagues have said. I would add that I’m very concerned about the president’s obstruction of Congress, obstruction of this inquiry, refusal to comply with a number of subpoenas, ordering many high level officials in the government not to comply with subpoenas and asking and ordering the entire executive branch not to cooperate with Congress. It’s useful to remember the constitution says the house has the sole power to impeach. Constitution only uses the word sole twice. Once with reference to the house in this area, once with reference to the Senate with respect to impeachment trials. Sole means sole, means only, and this is your decision.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	It’s always… It’s practically impossible to know what exactly what the framers would think, but it’s not hard to imagine how the Constitution deals with it. That’s their legacy to us. And under the Constitution, it’s plainly an abuse of power. It’s a rather horrifying abuse of power.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	It’s primarily significant because, in acting for his own personal benefit and not for the benefit of the country, he has crossed a line. The line here is very clear, and it becomes abuse of power when somebody is using the special authorities of their office for their own personal benefit and not the benefit of the country.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	That’s… It could be, yes. Yes.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes, I agree. And one thing I would add is that much talk has been made here about the term bribery and court decisions with respect to bribery. It’s your job. It’s the House’s job to define bribery, not the courts. You follow your judgment on that.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	My family did, yes.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	That sounds about right, yes.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	1
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	No as well.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Not until now.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	President Nixon also had ordered his subordinates to cooperate and testify. He didn’t shut down any of that. He produced documents. And there were times … There were certainly disagreements, but there was not a wholesale, broad scale, across the board refusal to even recognize the legitimacy of this House doing an inquiry.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes, ma’am, Article Three.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes ma’am, you are. And I might just point out that one of the difficulties with asking for a more thorough investigation is that’s exactly what the House has tried to conduct here and the president has refused to comply with subpoenas and other requests for information. That’s where the blockage occurs. That’s why there are documents not produced and why there are people not testifying, the people here have said today they want to hear from.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	His testimony is relevant. It’s also rather chilling to hear him say that everybody’s in the loop. And when he says that he’s talking about the people at the highest levels of our government, all of whom are refusing to testify under oath or comply with subpoenas.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I think you can look throughout the entire Constitution. A good place, of course, includes the supremacy clause. The president also takes an oath. He takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution of United States. That means that he’s assuming office with certain constraints on what he may do and that there are measures for accountability for any failure to follow his duty or follow the Constitution.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	The pattern, of course gives us a tremendous insight into the context of his behavior. When he’s acting and how do we explain those actions by looking at the pattern? We can infer I think a very strong inference in fact, is that this is deviating from the usual practice and he’s been systematically heading towards a culmination where he can ask this question. By the way, after the July 25th call, the money’s not yet released. There’s ongoing conversations we learned from other testimony that essentially the money was being withheld because the president wanted to make sure the deliverable was going to happen. That is the announcement of an investigation.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes ma’am that’s right.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes ma’am.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	It’s clearly obstruction of justice.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	The obvious object of this activity is to shut down an investigation. In fact the acts of the president, according to these facts, each time is to use the power that he has unique to his office, but in a way that’s going to help him frustrate the investigation.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	I believe it does. I mean the entire constitution including separation of powers is designed to put limits on how somebody may go about frustrating the activity of another branch.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes ma’am.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	It’s clearly conduct I think that worried the framers as reflected in the Constitution they’ve given us and the structure of that Constitution. The activities you’re talking about here are consistent with the other pattern of activity we’ve seen with the president either trying to stop investigations either by Mr. Mueller or by Congress as well as to ask witnesses to make false documents about testimony and all those different kinds of activities are not the kinds of activities the framers expected the president to be able to take. They expect a president to be held accountable for it and not just in elections.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	One way in which it contributes to the obstruction of Congress is that it doesn’t just defame Ambassador Yovanovitch. By every other account she’s been an exemplary public servant. So what he’s suggesting there may not be consistent with what we know as facts, but one of the things that also happens when he sends out something like this. It intimidates everybody else who’s thinking about testifying. Any other public servants that think they should come forward. They are going to worry that they’re going to get punished in some way. They’re going to face things like she’s faced.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	As I was discussing earlier and including my written statement, President Nixon ultimately refused to comply with four legislative subpoenas. These were zeroing in on the most incriminating evidence he had in his possession. So he refused to comply with those subpoenas, became the basis for the third article, and he resigned a few days later.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	It does. One way in which to understand that is to put all of his arguments together and then see what the ramifications are. He says he’s entitled not to comply with all subpoenas. He says he’s not subject to any kind of criminal investigation while he’s President of the United States. He’s immune to that. He’s entitled to keep all information confidential from Congress, doesn’t even have to give a reason. Well when you put all those things together, he’s blocked off every way in which to hold himself accountable except for elections. The critical thing to understand here is that is precisely what he was trying to undermine in the Ukraine situation.
2019-12-04	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	Yes ma’am. I believe it does. I remember when I was here 21 years ago along with Professor Turley testifying before differently constituted committee on a very serious question regarding impeachment and I remember a number of law professors very eloquently talking about President Clinton’s misconduct as an attack on the judicial system and that’s what you just described to me.
2019-12-09	Michael Gerhard	Expert	Expert	If what we’re talking about is not impeachable the nothing is impeachable.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you very much for the opportunity to appear. My name is Noah Feldman. I serve as the-
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I serve as the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at the Harvard Law School. My job is to study-
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	My job is to study and to teach the Constitution from its origins until the present. I’m here today to describe three things. Why the framers of our Constitution included a provision for the impeachment of the president. What that provision providing for impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors means. And last, how it applies to the question before you and before the American people, whether president Trump has committed impeachable offenses under the Constitution.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Let me begin by stating my conclusions. The framers provided for the impeachment of the president because they feared that the president might abuse the power of his office for personal benefit, to corrupt the electoral process and ensure his reelection or to subvert the national security of the United States. High crimes and misdemeanors are abuses of power and of public trust connected to the office of the presidency. On the basis of the testimony and the evidence before the House, President Trump has committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors by corruptly abusing the office of the presidency. Specifically, President Trump has abused his office by corruptly soliciting President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals in order to gain personal advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Let me begin now with the question of why the framers provided for impeachment in the first place. The framers borrowed the concept of impeachment from England, but with one enormous difference. The House of Commons and the House of Lords could use impeachment in order to limit the ministers of the King, but they could not impeach the King. And in that sense, the King was above the law. In stark contrast, the framers, from the very outset of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, made it crystal clear that the president would be subject to impeachment in order to demonstrate that the president was subordinate to the law.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	If you will, I would like you to think now about a specific date in the Constitutional Convention, July 20th, 1787. It was the middle of a long hot summer. And on that day, two members of the Constitutional Convention actually moved to take out the impeachment provision from the draft constitution. And they had a reason for that. And their reason was they said, “Well, the president will have to stand for reelection and if the president has to stand for reelection, that is enough, we don’t need a separate provision for impeachment.” When that proposal was made, significant disagreement ensued.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The governor of North Carolina, a man called William Davie, immediately said, if the president cannot be impeached, quote, “he will spare no efforts or means whatever to get himself reelected.” Following Davie, George Mason of Virginia, a fierce Republican critic of executive power said, “No point is more important than that impeachment be included in the Constitution. Shall any man be above justice?” he asked. Thus expressing the core concern, that the president must be subordinate to the law and not above the law.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	James Madison, the principal draftsman of the US Constitution then spoke up. He said it was quote, “Indispensable that some provision be made for impeachment.” Why? Because he explained, standing for reelection was quote, “not a sufficient security,” close quote, against presidential misconduct or corruption. “A president,” he said “might betray his trust to foreign powers.” A president who in a corrupt fashion, abused the office of the presidency, said James Madison quote, “Might be fatal to the Republic,” close quote.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	And then a remarkable thing happened in the convention. Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, one of the two people who had introduced the motion to eliminate impeachment from the Constitution, got up and actually said the words, “I was wrong.” He told the other framers present that he had changed his mind on the basis of the debate on July 20th and that it was now his opinion that in order to avoid corruption of the electoral process, a president would have to be subject to impeachment regardless of the availability of a further election. The upshot of this debate is that the framers kept impeachment in the Constitution. Specifically in order to protect against the abuse of office with the capacity to corrupt the electoral process or lead to personal gain.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Now turning to the language of the Constitution, the framers use the words, “high crimes and misdemeanor to describe those forms of action that they considered impeachable. These were not vague or abstract terms to the framers. The words high crimes and misdemeanors represented very specific language that was well understood by the entire generation of the framers. Indeed, they were borrowed from an impeachment trial in England, that was taking place as the framers were speaking, which was referred to in fact, by George Mason.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The words high crimes and misdemeanors referred to abuse of the office of the presidency for personal advantage, or to corrupt the electoral process, or to subvert the national security of the United States. There’s no mystery about the words high crimes and misdemeanors. The word high modifies both crimes and misdemeanors, so they’re both high. And high means, connected to the office of the presidency, connected to office. The classic form that was familiar to the framers was the abuse of office for personal gain or advantage. And when the framers specifically named bribery as a high crime and misdemeanor, they were naming one particular version of this abuse of office, the abusive office for personal or individual gain. The other forms of abuse of office abuse office? Abuse of office to affect elections and abuse of office to compromise national security, were further forms that were familiar to the framers.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Now, how does this language of high crimes and misdemeanors apply to President Trump’s alleged conduct? Let me be clear, the Constitution gives the House of Representatives, that is, the members of this committee and the other members of the House, quote, “Sole power of impeachment.” It’s not my responsibility or my job to determine the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before the House thus far, that is your constitutional responsibility. My comments will therefore follow my role, which is to describe and apply the meaning of impeachable offenses to the facts described by the testimony and evidence before the House. President Trump’s conduct as described in the testimony and evidence clearly constitutes impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	In particular, the memorandum and other testimony relating to the July 25th, 2019 phone call between the two presidents, President Trump and President Zelensky, more than sufficiently indicates that President Trump abused his office by soliciting the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in relation to the 2020 election. Again, the words abuse of office are not mystical or magical, they are very clear. The abusive office when the president uses a feature of his power, the awesome power of his office, not to serve the interests of the American public, but to serve his personal, individual, partisan, electoral interests. That is what the evidence before the House indicates. Finally, let me be clear that on its own, soliciting the leader of a foreign government in order to announce investigations of political rivals and perform those investigations would constitute a high crime and misdemeanor. But the House also has evidence before it that the president committed to further acts that also qualify as high crimes and misdemeanors.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	In particular, the House heard evidence that the president placed a hold on critical US aid to Ukraine and conditioned its release on announcement of the investigations of the Bidens and of the discredited CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. Furthermore, the House also heard evidence that the president conditioned a White House visit, desperately sought by the Ukrainian president, on announcement of the investigations. Both of these acts constitute impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution. They each encapsulate the framers’ worry that the president of the United States would take any means whatever, to ensure his reelection. And that is the reason that the framers provided for impeachment in a case like this one.  Questioning Part 1
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The Framers reserved impeachment for situations where the President abused his office, that is, used it for his personal advantage and in-particular, they were specifically worried about a situation where the President used his office to facilitate, corruptly, his own re-election. That’s, in fact, why they thought they needed impeachment and why waiting for the next election wasn’t good enough.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	On the facts that we have before the House right now, the President solicited assistance from a foreign government in order to assist his own re-election. That is, he used the power of his office, that no one else could possibly have used, in order to gain personal advantage for himself, distorting the election, and that’s precisely what the framers anticipated.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Abuse of power is when the President uses his office, takes an action that is part of the Presidency, not to serve the public interest, but to serve his private benefit. In-particular, it’s an abuse of power if he does it to facilitate his re-election or to gain an advantage that is not available to anyone who is not the President.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	If the President uses his office for personal gain, the only recourse available under the Constitution is for him to be impeached, because the President cannot be, as a practical matter, charged criminally while he is in office because the Department of Justice works for the President, so the only mechanism available, for a President who tries to distort the electoral process for personal gain, is to impeach him. That is why have impeachment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Based on that evidence and those findings, the President did commit an impeachable abuse of office.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The memorandum of that call between the two Presidents is absolutely crucial to the determination, to my determination, that the President abused his office.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes. In making the determination that the President committed an impeachable offense, I relied on the evidence that was before the House and the testimony. Then, when this report was issued, I continued to rely on that.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes. That evidence underscored the way that the President’s actions undercut national security.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The abuse of power occurs when the President uses his office for personal advantage or gain. That matters, fundamentally, to the American people because if we cannot impeach a President who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy, we live in a monarchy, or we live under a dictatorship. That’s why the Framers created the possibility of impeachment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment. That means the House has the right and the responsibility to investigate Presidential misconduct and where appropriate, to create and pass Articles of Impeachment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Ultimately, the reason that the Constitution provided for impeachment was to anticipate a situation like the one that is before you today. The Framers were not prophets, but they were very smart people with a very sophisticated understanding of human incentives. They understood that a President would be motivated, naturally, to try to use the tremendous power of office to gain personal advantage to keep himself in office, to corrupt the electoral process and, potentially, to subvert the national interest. The facts strongly suggest that this is what President Trump has done, and under those circumstances, the Framers would expect the House of Representatives to take action in the form of impeachment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I did.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The President sought personal gain and advantage by soliciting the announcement of investigations, and presumably investigations from Ukraine. To do so, he withheld critical assistance that the government of Ukraine needed, and by doing so, he undermined the national security interest of the United States in helping Ukraine, our ally, in a war that it is fighting against Russia. In the simplest possible terms, the President put his personal gain ahead of the national security interest as expressed, according to the evidence before you, by the entirety of a unanimous national security community.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	In my view, if the Framers were aware that a President of the United States had put his personal gain and interest ahead of the national security of the United States by conditioning aid to a crucial ally, that’s in the midst of a war, on investigations aimed at his own personal gain, they would certainly conclude that that was an abuse of the office of the Presidency and they would conclude that that conduct was impeachable under the Constitution.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The clear sense of bribery at the time when the Framers adopted this language in the Constitution was that bribery existed under the Constitution when the president corruptly asked for or received something of value to him from someone who could be affected by his official office. So if the House of Representatives and the members of this committee were to determine that getting the investigations, either announced or undertaken, was a thing of value to President Trump, and that that was what he sought, then this committee and this House could safely conclude that the president had committed bribery under the Constitution.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	No, it does not. If the president of the United States attempts to abuse his office, that is a complete impeachable offense. The possibility that the president might get caught in the process of attempting to abuse his office, and then not be able to pull it off, does not undercut in any way the impeach ability of the act.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	If you’ll pardon a comparison, President Nixon was subject to articles of impeachment, preferred by this committee, for attempting to cover up the Watergate break-in. The fact that President Nixon was not ultimately successful in covering up the break-in, was not grounds for not impeaching him. The attempt itself is the impeachable act.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The obstruction of Congress is a problem because it undermines the basic principle of the Constitution. If you’re going to have three branches of government, each of the branches has to be able to do its job. The job of the House is to investigate impeachment and to impeach. A president who says, as this president did say, “I will not cooperate in any way, shape, or form with your process,” robs a coordinate branch of government. He robs the House of Representatives of its basic constitutional power of impeachment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	When you add to that the fact that the same president says, “My Department of Justice cannot charge me with a crime,” the president puts himself above the law when he says he will not cooperate in an impeachment inquiry. I don’t think it’s possible to emphasize this strongly enough. A president who will not cooperate in an impeachment inquiry is putting himself above the law.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Now, putting yourself above the law as president is the core of an impeachable offense. Because if the president could not be impeached for that, he would in fact not be responsible to anybody.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I did. And as someone who cares about the Constitution, the second of those in particular struck a kind of horror in me.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I was.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	What changed for me was the revelation of the July 25th call, and then the evidence that emerged subsequently, of the president of the United States in a format where he was heard by others, and now known to the whole public, openly abused his office by seeking a personal advantage in order to get himself reelected. An act against the national security of the United States.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	That is precisely the situation that the Framers anticipated. It’s very unusual for the Framers’ predictions to come true that precisely. When they do, we have to ask ourselves, someday we will no longer be alive and we’ll go wherever it is we go, the good place or the other place, and we may meet there, Madison and Hamilton. They will ask us, “When the president of the United States acted to corrupt the structure of the republic, what did you do?” And our answer to that question must be that we followed the guidance of the Framers. And it must be that if the evidence supports that conclusion, that the House of Representatives moves to impeach him.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes. Bribery had a clear meaning to the framers. It was when the president, using the power of his office, solicits or receive something of personal value from someone affected by his official powers. And I want to be very clear, The Constitution is law. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. So of course, Professor Turley is right that you wouldn’t want to impeach someone who didn’t violate the law, but The Constitution, the supreme law of the land specifies bribery as a ground of impeachment as it specifies other high crimes and misdemeanors.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Bribery had a clear meaning. If the House believes that the president solicited something of value in the form of investigations or an announcement of investigations, and then he did so corruptly for personal gain, then that would constitute bribery under the meaning of The Constitution. And it would not be lawless, it would be bribery under the law.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The Constitution is the supreme law and the constitution specifies what bribery means. Federal statutes can’t trump The Constitution. They can’t defeat what’s in The Constitution.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I believe the framers would identify President Trump’s conduct as exactly the kind of abuse of office, high crime and misdemeanor that they were worried about and they would want the House of Representatives to take appropriate action and to impeach.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I believe that if the evidence supported those things in their minds and if the Congress determines that that is what the evidence means, then they would believe strongly that that’s what Congress ought to do.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Certainly not. Under The Constitution, the House is entitled to impeach. That’s its power. It doesn’t have to ask permission from anybody and it doesn’t have to go through any judicial process involving the judicial branch of government. That is your decision based on your judgment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, ma’am.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	What do you think is the most compelling evidence in this impeachment inquiry that would lead you to that?
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The phone call itself, of July 25th, is extraordinarily clear to my mind, in that we hear the president asking for a favor that’s clearly of personal benefit rather than acting on behalf of the interests of nation. And then further from that, further down the road, we have more evidence, which tends to give the context and to support the explanation for what happened.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Professor Karlan, how does such abuse affects our democratic systems?
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes ma’am. Impeachment is complete when the president abuses his office and he abuses his office by attempting to abuse his office. There’s no distinction there between trying to do it and succeeding in doing it, and that’s especially true if you only stop because you got caught.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Over 70% of the American people believe, as I said, what the president did was wrong. We have a solemn responsibility to address that. And as well, our fidelity to our oath and our duty, reminded of the men and women who serve in the United States military, and I’m reminded of my three uncles who served in World War II. I can’t imagine them being on the battlefield, needing arms and food, and the general says, “Do me a favor.” We know that general would not say, “Do me a favor.” And so in this instance, the American people deserve unfettered leadership and it is our duty to fairly assess the facts and the constitution. I yield back my time.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir. High crimes and misdemeanors are actions of the president in office, where he uses his office to advance his personal interests potentially for personal gain, potentially to corrupt the electoral process and potentially, as well, against the national security interest of the United States. I would add, sir, that the word high modifies both crimes and misdemeanors. The framers world knew of both high crimes and high misdemeanors, and I believe that the definition that was posted earlier of misdemeanor was not the definition of a high misdemeanor, which was a specific term understood by the framers and discussed and the constitutional convention, but only of the word misdemeanor. And that’s an easy mistake to make, but the truth is that high misdemeanors were their own category of abuses of office, and those are the things that are impeachable.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes sir.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	My emphasis would be on the fact that the president held up aid to an ally that’s fighting a war in direct contravention of the unanimous recommendation of the national security community. That to me seems to have placed his own interests in personal advantage ahead of the interests of the nation.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes sir.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The framers believed very strongly that the people were the king, the people were sovereign, and that meant that the president worked for somebody. He worked for the people. They knew that a president who couldn’t be checked, who could not be supervised by his own justice department and who could not be supervised by Congress and could not be impeached, would effectively be above the law and then would use his power to get himself reelected. And that’s why they created the impeachment remedy.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	It’s relevant, sir, because there’s nothing wrong with someone asking for a favor in the interest of the United States of America. The problem is for the president to use his office to solicit or demand a favor for his personal benefit. And the evidence strongly suggests that given the power of the president and given the incentives that the president created for Ukraine to comply with his request, that the president was seeking to serve his own personal benefit and his own personal interest. That’s the definition of corruption under the constitution.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Lieutenant Colonel Vindmans observation states very clearly that you have to understand that the President of United States has so much more power than the President of Ukraine. That when the president uses the word ‘favor’, the reality is that he’s applying tremendous pressure, the pressure of the power of the United States, and that relates to the constitutional abuse of office. If someone other than the President of the United States asked the President of Ukraine to do a favor, the President of Ukraine could say no. When the President of the United States uses the office of the presidency to ask for a favor, there’s simply no way for the President of Ukraine to refuse.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	He may not. If the president uses the powers that he’s given for personal gain, or to corrupt an election, or against the national security interests of the United States, he may be impeached for a high crime and misdemeanor.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The framers were extremely worried about a president who served only his own interests or the interests of foreign powers. That was their most serious concern when they designed the remedy of impeachment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	It means that it wasn’t just an abuse of power because the president was serving his own personal interests, but also an abuse of power in so far as the president was putting American national security interests behind his own personal interest. So it brought together two important aspects of the abuse of power, self gain and undercutting our national security interests.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	In my view, the evidence does meet that criteria, and that’s the judgment that you should be making.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I believe that impeachment is warranted whenever the president abuses his power for personal benefit or to corrupt the democratic process.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, I did write that article-
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	… back in May-
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	… 2019, I wrote that article.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Would let me answer the question, sir?
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Until this call in July 25th, I was an impeachment skeptic. The call changed my mind, sir, and for a good reason.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	It is not.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	It is not.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	No, that is not hearsay.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, I agree with that.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	It would be a disaster for the functioning of our democracy if our presidents regularly, as this president has done, asked foreign governments to interfere in our electoral process.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	If this committee in this house fail to act, then you’re sending a message to this president and to future presidents that it’s no longer a problem if they abuse their power. It’s no longer a problem if they invite other countries to interfere in our elections and it’s no longer a problem if they put the interests of other countries ahead of ours.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, sir.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Bribery was the classic example for them of the high crime and misdemeanor of abuse of office for personal gain. Because if you take something of value when you’re able to affect an outcome for somebody else, you’re serving your own interests and not the interests of the people. And that was commonly used in impeachment offenses in England, and that’s one of the reasons that they specified it.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Not raising our hands is not an indication of an answer, sir.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I do. Richard Nixon sent burglars to break into the Democratic National Committee headquarters, but President Trump just made a direct phone call to the president of a foreign country and sought his intervention in an American election.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Because the president of the United States works for the people. And so if he seeks personal gain, he’s not serving the interests of the people. He’s rather serving the interests that are specific to him. And that means he’s abusing the office and he’s doing things that he can only get away with because he’s the president. And that is necessarily subject to impeachment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	No.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, and indeed that’s the inevitable effect of a president refusing to participate. He’s denying the power of Congress under the Constitution to oversee him and to exercise its capacity to impeach.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Yes, it is.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	I agree with the thrust of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s opinion. I think that she correctly held that there is no absolute immunity which would protect a presidential adviser from having to appear before the House of Representatives and testify. She did not make a ruling as to whether executive privilege would apply in any given situation. I think that was also appropriate because the issue had not yet arisen.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Sorry. I don’t even think the framers could have imagined that a president would flatly refuse to participate in an impeachment inquiry, given that they gave the power of impeachment to the House of Representatives and assumed that the structure of the Constitution would allow the House to oversee the president.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Correct.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	He has and it’s crucial to note that the victim of a high crime in misdemeanors such as the president’s alleged to have committed is not President Zelensky and is not the Ukrainian people. The victim of the high crime and misdemeanor is the American people. Alexander Hamilton said very clearly that the nature of a high crime and misdemeanor is that they are related to injuries done to the society itself. We, the American people, are the victims of the high crime and misdemeanor.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The framers created one remedy to respond to high crimes and misdemeanors and that was impeachment.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	For the president to refuse to participate in any way in the House’s constitutional obligation of supervising him to impeach him breaks the constitution. It basically says, nobody can oversee me. Nobody can impeach me. First, I’ll block witnesses from appearing. Then I’ll refuse to participate in any way. Then I’ll say, you don’t have enough evidence to impeach me. Ultimately the effect of that is to guarantee that the president is above the law and can’t be checked. Since we know the framers put impeachment in the Constitution to check the president, if the president can’t be checked, he’s no longer subject to the law.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The framers considered, as you said, bribery to consist on bribery under the constitution to consist of the president abusing his office corruptly for personal gain. If this House determines and if this committee determines that the president was in fact seeking personal gain in seeking the investigations that he asked for, then that would constitute bribery under the Constitution.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Congresswoman, I’m here for the Constitution. We’re here for the Constitution. And when the President of the United States asks for assistance from a foreign power to distort our elections for his personal advantage, that constitutes an abusive office and it counts as a high crime and misdemeanor. And that’s what the Constitution is here to protect us against.
2019-12-04	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	The framers understood human motivation extremely well and they knew that a president would have a great motive to corrupt the electoral process to get reelected and that’s exactly why they thought that it wasn’t good enough to wait for the next election because the president could cheat and could make the next election illegitimate. That’s why they required impeachment and if they couldn’t impeach a corrupt president, James Madison said that could be fatal to the Republic. The reason that it’s necessary to take action now is that we have a president who has in fact sought to corrupt the electoral process for personal advantage. Under those circumstances, the framers remedy if impeachment is the only option available.
2019-12-09	Noah Feldman	Expert	Expert	Because if we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy. We live in a monarchy or we live under a dictatorship.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you so much for the opportunity to testify. Twice I have had the privilege of representing this committee and its leadership in voting rights cases before the Supreme Court. Once when it was under the leadership of the Chairman Sensenbrenner, and it’s good to see you again sir. And with Mr. Shabbat as one of my other clients. And once under the leadership of Chairman Conyers. It was a great honor for me to represent this committee because of this committee’s key role over the past 50 years in ensuring that American citizens have the right to vote in free and fair elections. Today you’re being asked to consider whether protecting those elections requires impeaching a president. That is an awesome responsibility, that everything I know about our constitution and its values, and my review of the evidentiary record. And here Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	So, I’m insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor, I don’t care about those facts. But everything I read on those occasions tells me that when President Trump invited, indeed demanded foreign involvement in our upcoming election, he struck at the very heart of what makes this a Republic to which we pledge allegiance. That demand, as Professor Feldman just explained, constituted an abuse of power. Indeed, as I want to explain in my testimony, drawing a foreign government into our elections is an especially serious abuse of power, because it undermines democracy itself. Our constitution begins with the words, “We the people,” for a reason.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Our government, in James Madison’s words, “Derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people.” And the way it derives these powers is through elections. Elections matter, both to the legitimacy of our government, and to all of our individual freedoms.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Because as the Supreme Court declared more than a century ago, voting is preservative of all rights. So, it is hardly surprising that the constitution is marbled with provisions governing elections and guarantee governmental accountability. Indeed, a majority of the amendments to our constitution since the Civil War have dealt with voting or with terms of office. And among the most important provisions of our original constitution is the guarantee of periodic elections for the presidency. One every four years. America has kept that promise for more than two centuries, and it has done so even during wartime. For example, we invented the idea of absentee voting so that Union troops who supported President Lincoln could stay in the field during the election of 1864. And since then, countless other Americans have fought and died to protect our right to vote. But the framers of our constitution realized that elections alone could not guarantee that the United States would remain Republic.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	One of the key reasons for including the impeachment power was a risk that unscrupulous officials might try to rig the election process. Now, you’ve already heard two people give William Davy his props. Hamilton got a whole musical and William Davy is just going to get this committee hearing, but he warned that unless the constitution contained an impeachment provision, a president might spare no efforts or means whatsoever to get himself reelected. And George Mason insisted that a president who procured his appointment in the first instance through improper and corrupt acts should not escape punishment by repeating his guilt. And Mason was the person responsible for adding high crimes and misdemeanors to the list of impeachable offenses. So, we know from that, that the list was designed to reach a president who acts to subvert an election. Whether that election is the one that brought him into office, or it’s an upcoming election where he seeks an additional term.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Moreover, the founding generation, like every generation of American since, was especially concerned to protect our government and our democratic process from outside interference. For example, John Adams during the ratification expressed concern with the very idea of having an elected president, writing to Thomas Jefferson that, “You are apprehensive of foreign interference, intrigue, influence. So am I. But as often as elections happen, the danger of foreign influence recurs.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	And in his farewell address, President Washington warned that history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of Republican government. And he explained that this was in part because foreign governments would try and foment disagreement among the American people and influence what we thought. The very idea that a president might seek the aid of a foreign government in his reelection campaign would have horrified them. But based on the evidentiary record, that is what President Trump has done.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	The list of impeachable offenses that the framers included in the constitution shows that the essence of an impeachable offense is a president’s decision to sacrifice the national interest for his own private ends. Treason, the first thing listed, lay in an individual’s giving aid to a foreign enemy. That is, putting a foreign enemies adversary’s interests above the interests of the United States.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Bribery, occurred when an official solicited, received, or offered a personal favor or benefit to influence official action, risking that he would put his private welfare above the national interest. And high crimes and misdemeanors captured the other ways in which a high official might as Justice Joseph Story explained, disregard public interests in the discharge of the duties of political office. Based on the evidentiary record before you, what has happened in the case today is something that I do not think we have ever seen before.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	A president who has doubled down on violating his oath to faithfully execute the laws, and to protect and defend the constitution. The evidence reveals a president who used the powers of his office to demand that a foreign government participate in undermining a competing candidate for the presidency. As president John Kennedy declared, “The right to vote in a free American election is the most powerful and precious right in the world, but our elections become less free when they are distorted by foreign interference.” What happened in 2016 was bad enough. There is widespread agreement that Russian operatives intervened to manipulate our political process. But that distortion is magnified if a sitting president abuses the powers of his office actually to invite foreign intervention.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	To see why, imagine living in a part of Louisiana or Texas that’s prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding. What would you think if you lived there and your governor asked for a meeting with the president to discuss getting disaster aid that Congress has provided for? What would you think if that president said, “I would like you to do us a favor. I’ll meet with you and I’ll send the disaster relief once you brand my opponent a criminal.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Wouldn’t you know in your gut that such a president had abused his office? That he betrayed the national interest, and that he was trying to corrupt the electoral process? I believe that that the evidentiary record shows wrongful acts on that scale here. It shows a president who delayed meeting a foreign leader, and providing assistance that Congress and his own advisors agreed serves our national interest in promoting democracy and in limiting Russian aggression. Saying, “Russia, if you’re listening.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	A president who cared about the constitution would say, “Russia, if you’re listening, but out of our elections.” And it shows a president who did this to strong-arm a foreign leader into smearing one of the president’s opponents in our ongoing election season. That’s not politics as usual, at least not in the United States or not in any mature democracy. It is instead a cardinal reason why the constitution contains an impeachment power. Put simply, a president should resist foreign interference in our elections, not demand it and not welcome it. If we are to keep faith with our constitution and with our Republic, President Trump must be held to account. Thank you.  Jonathan Turley Opening Statement
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, Mr. Chairman. It does.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	The way that it does it is exactly what President Washington warned about. By inviting a foreign government to influence our elections, it takes the right away from the American people, and it turns that into a right that foreign governments decide to interfere for their own benefit. Foreign governments don’t interfere in our elections to benefit us, they intervene to benefit themselves.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, they do.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Same answer.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	No, I don’t think it was a loose concept at all. It had a long lineage in the common law in England, of Parliamentary impeachments of lower level officers. Obviously, they had not talked about impeaching as you’ve heard earlier, the King or the like.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes. The Parliament in England impeached officers of the Crown when those people abused their power. If I could give you one example that might be a little helpful here, right after the restoration of the Kingship in England, there was an impeachment. When they impeached somebody, they had to say what were they impeaching him for? Sometimes, it would be, “We’re impeaching him for treason,” or the like, and sometimes they would use the phrase “high crime or misdemeanor.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	There was an impeachment of Viscount Mordaunt, which is a great name to have. Viscount Mordaunt, and he was impeached because he was the Sheriff of Windsor, and as the Parliamentary election was coming up, he arrested William Taylor. I just want to read to you from the Article of Impeachment in front of the House of Commons, because it’s so telling. Here’s what Article One of the impeachment said. It said, “Understanding that one, William Taylor, did intend to stand for the election of one of the Burgesses of the Borough of Windsor to serve in this present Parliament …
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	In other words, he was running as a member of Parliament. This is what Viscount Mordaunt did. ” To disparage and prevent the free election of the said, William Taylor, and strike a terror into those of the said Borough, which should give their voices for him, and deprive them of the freedom of their voices at the election, Viscount Mordaunt did command and cause the said, William Taylor, to be forcibly, illegally and arbitrarily seized upon by soldiers,” and then he detained him. In other words, he went after a political opponent and that was a high crime or misdemeanor to use your office to go after a political opponent.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Well, because this is an abuse that cuts to the heart of democracy, you need to ask yourselves, if you don’t impeach a President who has done what this President has done, or at least you don’t investigate and then impeach, if you conclude that the House Select Committee on Intelligence findings are correct, then what you’re saying is, “It’s fine to go ahead and do this again.” I think that in the report that came out last night, the report talks about the clear and present danger to the election system. It’s your responsibility to make sure that all Americans get to vote in a free and fair election next November.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	No, it did not.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Because they recognize that the inventiveness of man and the likelihood that this Constitution would endure for generations meant they couldn’t list all of the crimes that might be committed. They couldn’t imagine an abuse of power, for example, that involved burglarizing and stealing computer files from an adversary because they couldn’t have imagined computers.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	They couldn’t necessarily have imagined wire tapping because there we had no wires in 1789, so what they did is they put in a phrase that the English had used and had adapted over a period of centuries to take into account that the idea of high crimes and misdemeanors is to get at things that people in office use to strike at the very heart of our democracy.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Sure. Let me start with the Framers and what they were concerned with and then bring it up-to-date, because I think there’s some modern stuff as well that’s important. The Framers were very worried that elections could be corrupted. They could be corrupted in a variety of different ways, and they spent a lot of time trying to design an election system that wouldn’t be subject to that kind of corruption. There are a number of different provisions in the Constitution that deal with the kinds of corruption they were worried about too that I’d just like to highlight here because I think they go to this idea about the national interest and foreign governments, are one that seems today, I think to most of us, to be really a kind of remnant of a past time, which is if you become an American citizen, almost everything in this country is open to you. You can become Chief Justice of the United States, you can become Secretary of State. The one office that’s not open to you, even though you’re a citizen just like all of the rest of us, is the Presidency, because of the Natural Born Citizen Clause of the Constitution.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	The reason they put that in is they were so worried about foreign influence over a President. The other clause, which probably no one had heard of five years ago, but now everybody talks about is the Emoluments Clause. They were really worried that the President, because he was only going to be in office for a little while, would use it to get everything he could, and he would take gifts from foreign countries. Not even necessarily bribes, but just gifts, and they were worried about that as well, so they were very concerned about those elections, but it’s not just them.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I want to say something about what our national interest is today, because our national interest today is different in some important ways than it was in 1789. What the Framers were worried about was that we would be a weak country and we could be exploited by foreign countries. Now, we’re a strong power now, the strongest power in the world. We can still be exploited by foreign countries. The other thing that we’ve done, and this is one of the things that I think we, as Americans, should be proudest of, is we have become what John Winthrop said in his sermon in 1640, and what Ronald Reagan said in his final address to the country as he left office.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	We have become the shining city on a hill. We have become the nation that leads the world in understanding what democracy is. One of the things we understand most profoundly is it’s not a real democracy, it’s not a mature democracy if the party in power uses the criminal process to go after its enemies. I think you heard testimony, the Intelligence Committee heard testimony about how it isn’t just our national interest in protecting our own elections. It’s not just our national interest in making sure that the Ukraine remains strong and on the front lines so they fight the Russians there and we don’t have to fight them here.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	It’s also our national interest in promoting democracy worldwide, and if we look hypocritical about this, if we look like we’re asking other countries to interfere in our election, if we look like we’re asking other countries to engage in criminal investigations of our President’s political opponents, then we’re not doing our job of promoting our national interest in being that shining city on a hill.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, you can.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Based on the evidence that I’ve seen, which is reviewing the transcripts of the 12 witness who testified, looking at the call readout, looking at some of the President’s other statements, looking at the statement by Mr. Mulvaney and the like, yes, we do.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, that’s true.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Treason and bribery.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, they do.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Sure. The high crime or misdemeanor of bribery, I think it’s important to distinguish that from whatever the U.S. Code calls bribery today. The reason for this, in part, is because …
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	… In 1789 when the Framers were writing the Constitution, there was no federal Criminal Code. The first bribery statutes that the United States Congress passed would not have reached a President at all because the first one was just about customs officials, and the second one was only about judges. It wasn’t until, I don’t know, 60 years or so after the Constitution was ratified, that we had any federal crime of bribery at all. When they say, explicitly, in the Constitution that the President can be impeached and removed from office for bribery, they weren’t referring to a statute. I will say, I’m not expert on substantive federal criminal law. All I will say here is the bribery statute is a very complicated statute.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	What they were thinking about was bribery, as it was understood in the 18th century, based on the common law up until that point. That understanding was an understanding that someone, and generally even then, it was mostly talking about a judge. It wasn’t talking about a President because there was no President before that, and wasn’t talking about the King, because the King could do no wrong. What they were understanding then was the idea that when you took private benefits, or when you asked for private benefits in return for an official act, or somebody gave them to you to influence an official act, that was bribery.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	If you conclude that he asked for the investigation of Vice President Biden and his son for political reasons, that is to aid his re-election, then yes, you have bribery here.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, I did rely on that.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I did consider that, yes.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I did rely on that. In addition, because as I’ve already testified, I read the transcripts of all of the witnesses and the like. I relied on testimony from Ambassador Sondland and testimony from Mr. Morrison, testimony from Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, testimony for Ambassador Taylor. I relied on the fact that when … I think it was ambassador Taylor, but I may be getting, which one of these people wrong, sent the cable that said, “It’s crazy to hold this up based on domestic political concern.” No one wrote back and said, “That’s not why we’re doing it.” I relied on what Mr. Mulvaney said in his press conference.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	There’s a lot to suggest here that this is about political benefit. I don’t know if I can talk about another piece of Ambassador Sondland’s testimony now, or I should wait, tell me.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I want to just point to what I consider to be the most striking example of this, and the most … I spent all of Thanksgiving vacation sitting there reading these transcripts. I ate like a turkey that came to us in the mail that was already cooked because I was spending my time doing this. The most chilling line, for me, of the entire process was the following: Ambassador Sondland said, “He had to announce the investigations …” He’s talking about President Zelensky. “He had to announce the investigations. He didn’t actually have to do them as I understood it.” Then he said, “I never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed. The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani, or otherwise, was they had to be announced in some form.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	What I took that to mean was this was not about whether Vice President Biden actually committed corruption or not. This was about injuring somebody, who the President thinks of as a particularly hard opponent, and that’s for his private beliefs. Because if I can say one last thing about the interests of the United States, the Constitution of the United States does not care whether the next President of the United States is Donald J. Trump or any one of the Democrats, or anybody running on a third party. The Constitution is indifferent to that. What the Constitution cares about is that we have free elections, and so it is only in the President’s interest, it’s not the …
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	… solely in the president’s interest. It’s not the national interest that a particular president be elected or be defeated at the next election. The Constitution is indifferent to that.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	No, it doesn’t. If I could give an example that I think shows why soliciting is enough. Imagine that you were pulled over for speeding by a police officer, and the officer comes up to the window and says, “You were speeding, but if you give me 20 bucks, I’ll drop the ticket.” And you look in your wallet and you say to the officer, “I don’t have the 20 bucks.” And the officer says, “Okay, well, just go ahead. Have a nice day.” The officer would still be guilty of soliciting a bribe there, even though he ultimately let you off without your paying. Soliciting itself is the impeachable offense, regardless whether the other person comes up with it.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	So imagine that the president had said, “Will you do us a favor? Will you investigate Joe Biden?” And the president of Ukraine said, “You know what? No, I won’t, because we’ve already looked into this and it’s totally baseless.” The president would still have committed an impeachable act, even if he had been refused right there on the phone. So I don’t see why the ultimate decision has anything to do with the president’s impeachable conduct.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Well, we’ve already seen a little bit of it, which is he gets out on the White House lawn and says, “China, I think you should investigate Joe Biden.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I’m a scholar of the law of democracy, so as a citizen, I agree with what Professor Gerhardt said. As an expert, my limitation is that I’m a scholar of the law of democracy. I’m not a scholar of obstruction of justice or obstruction of Congress.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, I see a pattern in which the president’s views about the propriety of foreign governments intervening in our election process are the antithesis of what our framers were committed to. Our framers were committed to the idea that we as Americans decide our elections. We don’t want foreign interference in those elections. The reason we don’t want foreign interference in those elections is because we’re a self-determining democracy.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	If I could just read one quotation to you that I think is helpful in understanding this, it’s somebody who’s pointing to what he calls a straightforward principle. “It is fundamental to the definition of our national political community that foreign citizens do not have a constitutional right to participate in, and thus may be excluded from activities of democratic self-government.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	The person who wrote those words is now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in upholding the constitutionality of a federal statute that denies foreign citizens the right to participate in our elections by spending money on electioneering or by giving money to PACs. They have long been forbidden to give contributions to candidates. The reason for that is because that denies us our right to self-government.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	And then judge, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh was so correct in seeing this, that the Supreme Court, which as you know, has taken campaign finance case after campaign finance case to talk about the First Amendment. Summarily affirmed here. That is they didn’t even need to hear an argument to know that it’s constitutional to keep foreigners out of our election process.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yeah. I wanted to respond to the first question about bribery …
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	… If I could instead. Which is although counsel for the minority read Samuel Johnson’s definitions of high and crime and misdemeanor, he didn’t read the definition of bribery. Now I have the 1792 version of Johnson’s dictionary. I don’t have the initial one and there he defines bribery as the crime of giving or taking rewards for bad practices. And so if you think it’s a bad practice to deny military appropriations to an ally that have been given to him, if you think it’s a bad practice not to hold a meeting to buck up the legitimacy of a government that’s on the front line and you do that in return for the reward of getting help with your reelection, that’s Samuel Johnson’s definition of bribery.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	It’s just the online version.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Not favorably because as I suggested in my opening testimony, it was a kind of doubling down because President Nixon abused domestic law enforcement to go after his political opponents and what President Trump has done based on the evidence that we’ve seen so far is he’s asked a foreign country to do that, which means it’s not. It’s sort of like a daily double, if you will, of problems.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Thank you. So, obviously it’s not wafer thin. And the strength of the record is not just in the July 25th call. I think the way you need to ask about this is, how does it fit into the pattern of behavior by the president? Because what you’re really doing is you’re drawing inferences here. This is about circumstantial evidence, as well as direct evidence. That is you’re trying to infer, did the president ask for a political favor? And I think this record supports the inference that he did.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	What comparisons, professor Karlan, can we make between kings that the framers were afraid of and the president’s conduct today?
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	So kings could do no wrong, because the king’s word was law. And contrary to what president Trump has said, article two does not give him the power to do anything he wants, and I’ll just give you one example that shows you the difference between him and a king, which is the constitution says there can be no titles of nobility. So while the president can name his son Baron, he can’t make him a baron.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Thank you. The founding father, George Mason, asked, “Shall any man be above justice?” And Alexander Hamilton wrote that, “High crimes and misdemeanors mean the abuse of violation of some public trust.” As we move quickly, professor Feldman, you have previously testified that the president has abused his power. Is that correct?
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Having foreign interference in our election means that we are less free. It is less we the people who are determining who’s the next winner than it is a foreign government.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I think it is fair to say that the president’s actions are unprecedented. But what also strikes me is how many republicans and democrats believe that his conduct was wrong. Let’s listen to him-
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, it is.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, he has.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I think what illuminates that most for me is the statement by ambassador Sondland that he wanted simply the announcement of an investigation, and several other people said exactly the same thing. There’s testimony by ambassador Volker to this extent as well. That what he wanted was simply public information to damage Joe Biden. He didn’t care whether at the end of the day Joe Biden was found guilty or exonerated.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	No. If you conclude that, as I think the evidence to this point shows, that the president is foreign involvement in our election, you need to act now to prevent foreign interference in the next election like the one we had in the past.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	because he invited the Russians who are a longtime adversaries into the process. The last time around, because he has invited the Ukrainians into the process, and because he suggested he would like the Chinese to come into the process as well.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I thought the president abused his power by asking for an investment criminal investigation of a United States citizen for political ends, regardless of everything else. That’s just not icing on the cake, it’s what you would call an aggravating circumstance that there was here.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	No, they go to the foundation, the very foundation of our democracy.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	No. It’s the essence of doing something for personal reasons rather than for political reasons, and if I could just say one thing about this very briefly, which is, maybe when he was first running for president, he had never been anything other than a reality TV show. That was his public life. Maybe then he could think Russia, if you’re listening, is an okay thing to do, but by the time he asked the Ukraine, Ukraine, if you’re listening, could you help me out with my reelection, he has to have known that that was not something consistent with his oath of office.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Well, I think that, to have a president ask for the investigation of his political opponents is an archetype of the abusive power, and Mr. Buck mentioned past examples of this, and to say that those weren’t impeachable, I think, is a big mistake. If a president wire taps his opponents, that’s a federal crime now. I don’t know whether before the wiretap act of 1968 it was, but if a president wiretapped his opponents today, that would be impeachable conduct.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Well, I can’t speak for the framers themselves, obviously. My view is that they would say that the president’s authority to use foreign aid… And they probably couldn’t have imagined we even were giving foreign aid, because we were tiny poor country then. So, it’s a little hard to translate that, but what they would have said is, a president who doesn’t think first about the security of the United States is not doing what his oath requires him to do, which was faithfully execute the laws here, a law appropriating money, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, and one question I would just have for the minority members of the committee is if you were convinced that the president held up the aid because he thought it would help his reelection, would you vote to impeach him? Because I think that’s really the question that everyone on this committee should be asking and if they conclude yes, then they should vote to impeach.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, it is.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	That’s correct.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Honestly, it was less important to them than it’s become in our constitution since then. And if you’ll remember, one of the things that turned me into lawyer was seeing Barbara Jordan, who was the first female lawyer I’d ever seen in practice, say, on the committee that we, the people didn’t include people like her in 1789 but through a process of amendment, we have done that. And so elections are more important to us today as a constitutional matter than they were even to the framers.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	That’s correct.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Because foreign nations don’t have our interests at heart. They have their interests at heart.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I think they’d find it unacceptable for a president to ask a foreign government to help him whether they put pressure on him or not.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, it is. And if I could go back to one of the words you read, when the president said, “Do us a favor,” he was using the royal we there. It wasn’t a favor for the United States. He should have said, “Do me a favor,” because only kings say us when they mean me.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, it does.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I believe so.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I have no reason to question that.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	That’s correct.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Because I’ve been giving a lot of money to charity recently because of all of the poor people in the United States.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I think I was on a live panel that the people who ran the podcast called Versus Trump.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, I did.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	No. What I was talking about there was the natural tendency, if you put the quote in context, the natural tendency of a compactness requirement to favor a party whose voters are more spread out. And I do not have contempt for conservatives.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	And I do not have contempt for [crosstalk 01:14:57].
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	When the president calls-
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Gentleman’s time-
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Gentleman’s time has expired.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Gentleman’s time has expired. Mr. Cicilline.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	The reason that the framers were concerned about foreign interference, I think, is slightly different than the reason we are. They were concerned about it because we were such a weak country in 1789. We were small. We were poor. We didn’t have an established Navy. We didn’t have an established army. Today the concern is a little different, which is that it will interfere with us making the decisions that are best for us as Americans.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I agree with Professor Feldman and I should say just one thing and I apologize for getting a little overheated a moment ago, but I have a constitutional right under the first amendment to give money to candidates. At the same time, we have a constitutional duty to keep foreigners from spending money in our elections, and those two things are two sides of the same coin.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	It relates to the abuse of power. The entanglements with foreign nations is a more complicated concept for the framers than for us.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I think it suggests that we don’t believe in the rule of law, and I think it tells emerging democracies around the world not to take it seriously when we tell them that their elections are not legitimate because of foreign interference or their elections are not legitimate because of prosecution of the opposing party. I mean, President Bush announced that he did not consider the elections in Belarus, in 2006, to be legitimate for exactly that reason because they went after political opponents.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	That’s correct. I’m sorry. That’s correct.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, it does.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I don’t think we’re obligated to say anything about how we cast our ballots.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I will not-
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I have a right to cast a secret ballot.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	It blows it out of the water.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Well, Congress has enacted a series of laws to make sure that there isn’t foreign influence in our elections, and allowing the President to circumvent that principle is a problem. And as I’ve already testified several times, America is not just the last best hope, as Mr. Jeffrey said, but it’s also the shining city on a hill. And we can’t be the shining city on a hill and promote democracy around the world if we’re not promoting it here at home.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	No.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Almost always.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	That’s correct.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, it goes to the one about procedural irregularities and it also goes to the one that says you look at the kind of things that led up to the decision that you’re trying to figure out somebody’s motive about.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, it would. It goes to the factor about substantive departures.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes. That would also go to the factors the Supreme Court’s discussed.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	That goes to whether the claim that this is about politics is a persuasive claim because that goes to the fact that it’s being announced publicly, which is an odd thing. I mean, maybe Mr. Swalwell could probably answer this better than I because he was a prosecutor, but generally you don’t announce the investigation in a criminal case before you conduct it, because it puts the person on notice that they are under investigation.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Well, I think you ought to make that credibility determination because you have the sole power of impeachment. If I were a member of the House of Representatives, I would infer from this that he was doing it for political reasons.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes sir.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I don’t have the document.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Oh thanks. I think that’s correct and if I can just say one thing.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I want to apologize for what I said earlier about the president’s son. It was wrong of me to do that. I wish the president would apologize obviously for the things that he’s done that’s wrong, but I do regret having said that.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	The framers of our constitution would have considered it abhorrent, would have considered it the essence of a high crime or misdemeanor for a president to invite in foreign influence either in deciding whether he will be reelected or deciding who his successor would be.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes, it is.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Yes. This takes us back to the quotation from William Davey that we’ve all used several times in our testimony, which is a president, without impeachment, a president will do anything to get reelected.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	I think that Mr. Mulvaney is conflating or confusing two different notions of politics. Yes, there is political influence on our foreign affairs. Because President Trump won the election in 2016 we’ve exited Climate Accords. We’ve taken a different position on NATO than we would have taken had his opponent won. But that’s different than saying that partisan politics, in the sense of electoral manipulation, is something that we need to get over or get used to. If we get over that or we get used to that, we will cease to become the democracy that we are right now.
2019-12-04	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	We will cease to be a republic.
2019-12-09	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Drawing a foreign government into our elections is an especially serious abuse of power because it undermines democracy itself.
2019-12-09	Pamela Karlan	Expert	Expert	Without objection, I now recognize the ranking member for any concluding remarks he may have.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	But the very document that created the awesome presidency and its powers that we have made clear, it is a requirement that the president be a person who does not abuse his power. It is a requirement that the president be a person who does not risk national security of this nation and the integrity of our elections in order to further his own reelection prospects. It is a requirement that the president not be a person who acts as though he is above the law in putting his personal and political interests above the nation’s interests. That is the lesson of the constitution. That is the lesson of the founders.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	They were concerned that someone would be elected president who would use all the power of that office to serve his own personal interests at the expense of the people who elected him. They decided there needed to be a remedy because they had suffered the abuses of King George where they had no remedy. The remedy they imposed was that if a president commits a grave offense, a high crime or misdemeanor, this body has the power to impeach that president. They wanted to ensure that a president could not serve his own interests over that of the nation. It flows from the very oath that all members of this body must take to support and defend the constitution and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That is why we are here today, and it is an unfortunate occasion that these proceedings are necessary. But the president’s actions have left no choice. The founders were very clear in spelling out what they saw to be the greatest abuses that would raise the most concerns for our nation. They spelled them out as warning signals that if a president violated or committed one of these, that would be a reason to potentially impeach that president. They were abuse of power, betrayal of the national interest, corruption of elections. And what is so extraordinary is the conduct we’re going to be talking about today of President Trump didn’t violate one of these but all three.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	First, the evidence is overwhelming that the president abused his power by pressuring Ukraine and its new president to investigate a political opponent. The evidence is overwhelming that the president abused his power by ramping up that pressure by conditioning a wanted White House meeting and a needed military aid that had been approved in order to get that president to investigate a political rival. It is clear and overwhelming that in abusing that power, the president betrayed the national interest by putting his own political prospects over the national security of our country. It is clear that the president risks corrupting our elections by inviting foreign interference to knock out an adversary to help his prospects in reelection.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	It is why in debating the constitution, James Madison warned that because the presidency, “Was to be administered by a single man,” his corruption, “might be fatal to the Republic.” The scheme by President Trump was so brazen, so clear, supported by documents, actions, sworn testimony, uncontradicted, contemporaneous records that it’s hard to imagine that anybody could dispute those acts, let alone argue that that conduct does not constitute an impeachable offense or offenses. This is a big deal. President Trump did what a president of our nation is not allowed to do. It is why last week, the constitutional scholar, Professor Michael Gearhart said, “If what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable.” President Trump’s actions are impeachable offenses. They threaten our rule of law. They threaten our institutions and as James Madison warned us, they threaten our Republic.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Let me begin where we must with the facts and evidence. First, it’s important to understand why Ukraine was so important to our national security. Ukraine was under attack by its aggressive and hostile neighbor, Russia. They had already encroached on its territories. The Ukraine was at great risk that Russia would again take further territory or try. Europe had a stake in this and so did we. I’m going to turn to an expert on this, Ambassador Taylor, who is one of the most highly-decorated and recognized diplomats. For over 40 years, he served our country honorably and he was appointed by President Trump himself to be in charge of the U.S. embassy in Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That is Ambassador Taylor explaining why Ukraine was so important and explaining why the president’s actions so significantly risked hurting our national security, our national defense policy, and our national interest. Now, you’ve already heard there is significant proof that President Trump himself told the new president of the Ukraine, President Zelensky, that he wanted him to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. You’ll hear a lot about that today, but that proof is only the tip of the iceberg. There are so many more events, and meetings, and contemporaneous text messages, emails, other documents that show this happened and happened exactly as it is alleged. And it is clear that in this scheme to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival, the person at the center of that scheme was President Donald Trump.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	The facts cannot be disputed. President Trump use the powers of government for a domestic political errand to put his political interests above that of the nation. I’m going to turn to another expert. I’m going to turn to Dr. Fiona Hill, the National Security Council senior director in the Trump administration, and she’s going to explain what happened.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And that tells you what the evidence shows. The president put his own domestic political interests over the nation’s national security and foreign policy. A president cannot abuse his power to secure an election. He cannot do that at the expense of the American people. That is an impeachable offense. The president has tried to make excuses for his conduct, why it’s not wrongful, or corrupt, or an abuse of power. But the truth holds together. It makes sense. It’s consistent with the evidence. When someone is offering an excuse that is not true, it is not consistent with the evidence, it does not make sense, it cannot be squared with what the facts show, and you will see these excuses do not make sense.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	The facts are clear that President Trump put his own political and personal interests over the nation’s interest. I’d like to go through what you are going to see about the president’s scheme and you’re going to hear about today from the facts that we have. First, you’re going to hear that President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pushed Ukraine to open an investigation of his political rival. Mr. Giuliani, prior to the July, 25th call, he made public statements that Ukraine should investigate the former Vice President Joe Biden. He tweeted about it, putting pressure on the new president. He went to Ukraine and later, went again with the assist and direction of U.S. officials who were told to aid the president’s personal lawyer on the president’s behalf.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	You’ll hear that President Trump told his aides that he was relying on for Ukraine, that he wanted them to, “Talk to Rudy.” What you’re going to hear is that his close advisors had just gotten back on May, 23rd from the inauguration of the new president, President Zelensky. They told President Trump, “We were impressed. He was elected on an anti-corruption platform, a reform platform. You should schedule a White House meeting. It’s very important. This is very good for the United States.” And the president’s response was, “Talk to Rudy,” who had been out there claiming what the Ukrainian president had to do was investigate his political rival. You’ll hear that President Trump’s advisers told President-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	President Trump’s advisers told President Zelensky that President Trump would not schedule the wanted White House meeting unless he announced a Ukrainian investigation of former Vice President Biden. There are documents. There’s sworn testimony. This happened and there is no question from the evidence that the president did this. President Zelensky desperately needed a white house meeting both to show Russia that the US was still supporting Ukraine and for his own credibility as a new president.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	You’ll hear then, to ramp up the pressure, what President Trump did is he told his agencies to withhold military and security aid that had been approved and was supposed to be released to Ukraine, hundreds of millions of dollars, in order to put more pressure on Ukraine. All the agencies involved, state department, feds department, national security council said it should be released. It had been approved. It was going to be released until President Trump personally stopped it. Again, contemporaneous evidence and documents show it and prove it.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	People said that they were shocked. Ambassador Taylor said he was in astonishment. Witnesses said that it was illogical to do this and the president never offered an explanation, but ultimately it was discovered why he did it. Then on the July 25th call, President Trump explicitly told him he wanted him to do two Ukrainian investigations, one of a US citizen and his political rival and the other about the origins of interference in the 2016 election, some conspiracy theory that Russia, who all the intelligence agencies agreed, interfered with the 2016 election. Maybe it was Ukraine. Again, another investigation intended to help the president politically. That is it.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	You know, the president cared about the investigations that would help him politically and not Ukraine and not the national security interest. You don’t have to take my word. I’m going to play something from David Holmes, who had worked in the US Embassy in Ukraine and was speaking to Ambassador Sondland, who president Trump appointed. Ambassador Sondland that had just come to the Ukraine on the 26th. He met with President Zelensky. He went to a restaurant with Mr. Holmes, the US Political Affairs Counselor in Ukraine. He called President Trump on his cell phone and Mr. Holmes could hear that call. Then he spoke to Mr. Sondland. Let’s see what happened on July 26, the day after that call.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That is sworn testimony by David Holmes who heard it from the president himself. It was clear to everyone, the most experienced people in government who Donald Trump himself appointed in their positions, they knew what was going on. Let’s look at a text message from Ambassador Taylor. Around this time on September 9th he said, “As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.” Again, that is President Trump putting his own political and personal interests over the nation’s interests to hold aid desperately needed by Ukraine in order to combat Russia and show the support. He did it to help his own campaign.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now there’ve been excuses offered by the president. I’d like to briefly talk about those excuses. The first excuse offered by President Trump is that the aid was ultimately released and President Trump met with Mr. Zelensky. We heard it today. The challenge with that, though, as an excuse is the aid was only released after President Trump got caught doing this scheme. On September 9th, the committees of this house started their investigation and announced they were investigating his conduct with regard to Ukraine. Two days later was when he released the aid. There also was a news article which we’ll talk about in a moment by the Washington Post on September 5th exposing his scheme. It was only after that, that he met with President Zelensky, not in the White House, but in New York.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Another excuse offered, the president was motivated by general corruption concerns. Again, the evidence shows that is not true that, that’s what caused him to withhold the aid. President Zelensky in fact was elected on an anticorruption platform. He was a reform candidate. His own people told them again and again, President Zelensky is a hope. He’s doing it the right way. They urged him just be supportive.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	On his call with President Zelensky on July 25th, President Trump ignored the talking points that were prepared to talk about corruption. He only wanted to talk about two things: the two investigations that helped him politically. Every intelligence agency unanimously supported releasing the to Ukraine, that it was appropriate. They did a corruption study. They said, “Release it.” The White House never provided an explanation. The aid had already been approved and it was not for any corruption issues that President Trump withheld it.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	The next is Ukraine was not pressured. The argument about that is, well, today they haven’t said they were pressured. Well, Ukraine was pressured then and still is pressured. They are desperately in need of the United States support as they battle the threat of Russia. Of course they have to be careful what they said, but contemporaneous documents, emails, texts from the Ukrainian officials themselves show the pressure they felt, showed they knew what the President Trump was doing, showed what they had to do.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	This is one from Bill Taylor to, again, Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Ambassador Kurt Volker: “Gordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk’s, a senior aide of President Zelensky, point that President Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely an instrument in Washington’s domestic reelection politics.” They not only felt the pressure, they got the message. They were not going to get a White House meeting. They were ultimately not going to get military aid unless they furthered President Trump’s reelection efforts. That is a corrupt abuse of power.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Another argument that’s made is that Trump never said quid pro quo. What you’re going to hear is on a call with Ambassador Sondland, after a Washington Post article came out on September 5th, which we will look at. After that, there was a Washington Post article that came out that, again, exposed the Ukrainian scheme. Days after that President Trump was on a phone call with Ambassador Sondland and without prompting said, “There was no quid pro quo,” because he got caught. He’s offering his defense, but even Ambassador Sondland, in his sworn testimony, didn’t buy it because ultimately then President Trump not only was not dissuaded, he again described what he wanted. He didn’t want Ukraine to actually conduct these investigations. He wanted them to announce the investigations of his political rival to help him politically. He continued and you’ll hear more about that. Again, none of these excuses hold any water and they are refuted by testimony, contemporaneous records, and more.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now, some have suggested that we should wait to proceed with these impeachment proceedings because we’ve not heard from all of the witnesses or obtained all the documents, but the reason we have not heard from all the witnesses or documents is because President Trump himself has obstructed the investigation. He’s directed his most senior aides who are involved in some of these events not to come testify, to defy subpoenas. He has told every one of his agencies with records that could be relevant not to produce those records to us, to try to obstruct our investigation.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now this is evidence that President Trump is replaying the playbook used in the prior Department of Justice investigation. In that investigation he directed his White House council to create a false, phony record and document and lie, denying that President Trump had told him to fire the special counsel. He did many other things to try to interfere with that investigation. He attacked the investigators, and witnesses, and called them horrible names just as he has done here. President Trump thought he got away with it. On July 24th was the day that the special counsel testified before this committee and the House Intelligence Committee, the 24th.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	It was exactly the following day, the 25th, that President Trump spoke to Presidents Zelensky and in furtherance of Ukrainian scheme. He thought he got away with it. Not only that he thought he could use his powers to interfere with that investigation so he could do what he wanted, he could act like he was above the law. If he got caught, he would again use his powers to try to obstruct the investigation and prevent the facts from coming out.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That’s exactly what he did, but fortunately, because of the true American Patriots who came forward to testify despite the threats by the president against the people who worked in his own administration, they told the story. They, on their own, produced documents that provide uncontroverted, clear, and overwhelming evidence that President Trump did this scheme. He put his political reelection interests over the nation’s national security and the integrity of its elections. He did it intentionally. He did it corruptly. He abused his powers in ways that the founders feared the most. No person in this country has the ability to prevent investigations and neither does the president. Our constitution does not allow it. No one is above the law, not even the president. One of the concerns and requirements of finding an impeachable offense, is there an urgency? Is there a sense that you have to move because it could be repeated? Well, again, first, all the constitutional experts who testified recognize that obstructing an investigation is an impeachable offense, but here, the offense we’re talking about that’s being interfered or obstructed with is interfering with this very election that’s coming up. I submit to you, given what happened with the department of justice …
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And I submit to you, given what happened with the Department of Justice investigation, given what’s happening here, if in fact President Trump can get away with what he did again, our imagination is the only limit to what President Trump may do next or what a future president may do next, to try to abuse his or her power to serve his own personal interest over the nation’s interest.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	I’d like to turn back to what the founders most cared about and we talked about the ABCs of of potential presidential abuses. It is extraordinary that the president’s conduct was a trifecta, checking all three boxes. Let’s begin with abuse of power.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	What that means, it’s to use the power of the office to obtain an improper personal benefit while ignoring or injuring the national interest, or acts in ways that are grossly inconsistent with and undermine the separation of powers that is the foundation of our democratic system.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now this question of whether president engaged in abuse of power came up before when this Congress considered the impeachment of President Nixon and after action was taken, President Nixon famously said, “If the president does it, it is not illegal,” and this body rejected that because that’s not so that goes directly contrary to what the founder said. But President Trump has said the same thing in responding to the prior investigation by the Department of Justice in defending his conduct. Here’s what he said.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That he has the right to do whatever he wants as president. That is as wrong as when President Nixon said a similar thing. That is not what the constitution provides. That is not what the country demands. He does not have the right to do whatever he wants.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Turning to the second abuse of power, most of the concerned betrayal of the nation involving foreign powers. The American people have suffered that foreign influence. When President Trump treated military aid that had been approved, taxpayers’ dollars and decided to treat it as his own checkbook to try to further his own re-election chances, that reflects what the founders were concerned about it.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And finally, corruption of our elections. The framers knew that corrupt leaders or leaders acting corruptly concentrate their powers to manipulate elections and undercut adversaries. They talked about it frequently. That is why the framers thought electoral treasury, particularly involving foreign powers, was a critical abuse and and that could support and lead to impeachment. Now, the American people learned last election how dangerous foreign intervention or elections can be.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Let me show another clip from President… from candidate Trump on the campaign trail.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And Russia was listening. Within approximately five hours, five hours of President Trump’s invitation to Russia to interfere in our election by trying to hack in, obtain the emails of his political opponent, Russia, in fact, tried to do that for the first time. The very officers who were then indicted by the Department of Justice for that conduct, they took candidate candidate Trump’s invitation.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now the American people learned a lesson. President Trump unfortunately, apparently learned a different lesson. Let’s look.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So this was President Trump answering a question about what did he want President Zelensky to do. So even after he got caught, he is saying again, this vulnerable nation, dependent on US support militarily and otherwise, again, he’s telling them what to do and unlike in 2016 when he only had a campaign platform, which to extend the invitation to a foreign power, now he has the levers of government in his control to not only request it and invite it, but to pressure that country to do it and that’s exactly what he did and you’ll hear more about that in the presentation for the House Intelligence Committee.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	What’s most striking as we come back to this issue that the framers were concerned about, is there a continuing risk of wrongdoing? The fact that President Trump did this, after he was caught, shows the risk, shows the risk of what will happen if this body doesn’t act.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	He really does believe he can act as though he were above the law. He really does believe, as evidenced by this conduct, that he can put his personal and political interests over the nation’s interest, over the nation’s national security interests, over the nations integrity of its elections.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	"So of course we do have an election coming up. That’s not a reason to postpone this discussion. That’s a reason we must have this discussion; to make sure it is not interfered with to make sure this president doesn’t do it, to make sure future presidents do not do it."
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	It is the hope that in these discussions can put aside political rancor, disagreements and have a fair discussion about the facts in this conduct, not just as it relates to President Trump, but as to the presidency itself and future presidents. My son, our children, our grandchildren, they will study this moment in history. They will read all of your remarks. They will learn about all of your actions and that is not a reason to vote for or against impeachment. For that, of course, you must vote your conscience, but that is a reason for us to have a fair debate about what the undisputed facts show to recognize that it is wrong. It is very wrong and in cannot happen again with this president or any president. It is a reason to talk about whether we want our children and grandchildren to live in a country where the president elected by the people can put his own personal and political interests over the interests of the people who elected them.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	It is a reason for these debates to, again, fairly focus on the facts and to make sure the presentations we’re going to hear will not distort the record. Focus on process points, raise extraneous matters that really are intended to distract rather than focus on what the conduct was at issue here. It is a reason to focus on the facts and what is in the country’s best interest. History, future generations will be the judge.  Republican Counsel Stephen Castor’s Opening Statement
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr Caster, as an experienced investigator, would you agree that it’s relevant to look at evidence bearing on the president’s state of mind that may help explain the president’s actions?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, my only question to you is, is that a relevant thing to consider?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	It’s relevant to consider. Sir, would you agree that Joe Biden was a leading democratic contender to face President Trump in 2020?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	You disagree with it? So sir, it’s your testimony-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	… that President Trump did not view President Biden to be a legitimate contender?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, as part of your inquiry, did you determine whether President Trump tweeted at all about former Vice President Joe Biden between January and July 25th, and how many times?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Did you know President Trump tweeted about former Vice President Joe Biden over 25 times between January and July 25th?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Did you look at how many times President Trump mentioned Vice President Biden in a speech or rally leading up to the July 25th call?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Caster, you are aware that President Trump announced his candidacy for reelection in 2020, and he announced it the month before the July 25th call on June 21st?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Did you look at that in your investigation, as part of looking at President Trump’s intent, and what he intended on the July 25th call?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And sir, you knew that president Biden had already announced his intent to run in April of that year too, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So you would agree with me that if the Ukraine announced a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, that would hurt his credibility as a candidate. Would you agree with that basic principle, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Yes or no sir? Would you agree with that principle?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, I’m not asking you to read that. If you want to talk about the transcript, I want to talk to you about some… You said it’s eight lines. Let’s look at slide three, if we may, the reference to Biden. Sir, you see on the July 25th call, on page four, isn’t it the fact that President Trump in his call with President Zelensky said that he heard that former Vice President Joe Biden had stopped the prosecution of his son? Is that correct, sir? Yes or no?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That is correct. He said he stopped the prosecution.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	I’m only asking you what it says on the transcript. Is that what it says, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	… says, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And that Biden stopped the prosecution. It says that, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And then it also says, it goes on to say, President Trump asked President Zelensky if you can look into it, correct? Is that the words? If you can look into it, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So President Trump, am I right, President Trump was asking Ukrainian President Zelensky to have the Ukrainian officials look into Vice President Joe Biden, correct? Is that correct, yes or no?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	It doesn’t say can you look into it? President Trump is not asking him to-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Mr. Goldman, you’re an experienced federal prosecutor. I know that first hand. Is this President Trump asking President Zelensky to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And Mr. Castor, you made the point… Let me ask you a question. As an experienced investigator is it your experience that when someone has done something wrongful or corrupt and they’re dealing with somebody who’s not in the scheme that they state they’re intentions to do something wrongful and corrupt? Is that your experience as an investigator?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	I’m just asking you in general.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	In general.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Yes.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Would he generally admit that he was doing something wrongful and corrupt to someone not in the scheme?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And you made a bit point, sir, in your presentation that on that call, President Trump did not go further and tell President Zelensky that he wanted the investigation announced to help his 2020 election.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Yeah. And Mr. Goldman, would you agree that if President Trump was acting corruptly, wrongfully, abusing his power, that it was unlikely he was going to confess to President Zelensky that he was asking for the investigation explicitly to help his 2020 election prospects?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Thank you, Mr. Goldman. And Mr. Castor, getting back to you, you said that … You said about Hunter Biden and talked about it, Hunter Biden had been on the board of Burisma going back to 2014, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	President Trump supported Ukraine with aid and otherwise both in 2017 and 2018, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Yes. And sir, but isn’t it correct that President Trump did not raise anything about Hunter Biden and his father, Vice President Joe Biden, in 2017 or 2018. He only did it the year before his election in 2020 when both he and Vice President Joe Biden were leading candidates. Isn’t that true, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, please answer my question. He didn’t raise any of these issues in 2017 or 2018.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	You’ve no evidence that he did, did you?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	All right, sir, let me ask you this. You talked about Lt. Col. Vindman who is a highly decorated Purple Heart recipient and worked in the Trump administration, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	He had a reaction to the call, didn’t he?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	He was listening to it, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Let’s look at his reaction. He said, “I immediately went to John Eisenberg, the lead legal counsel. He said it is improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a US citizen and a political opponent.” That was his testimony, correct? Yes or no. That was his testimony. Yes?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Yes. And let me ask you this, sir. You had said that the Intelligence Committee, Majority Report, that Mr. Goldman had talked about, you said it presents as if things are clear, but they’re not clear. Is that what you said, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And you also worked on, you were, personally, you said worked on the Minority Report, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Was it important to you to be accurate in the Minority Report-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	… that you worked on?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Was it important to be fair to witnesses, to be accurate about what they said?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Was it important to be fair to the American people-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	… to accurately report what people said?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Well, let me ask you about somebody else on that call. Let me ask you about Jennifer Williams. Now she was a special advisor to Vice President Pence on Europe and Russia affairs, is that correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	She worked for Vice President Pence, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And you said in your opening statement that these accusations that President Trump was trying to do something for political purpose, that was made by people who had pre-determined motives for impeachment. Isn’t that correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Are you calling Vice President Pence’s special advisor a liar, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Are you saying she was predetermined to impeach?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	I didn’t ask you, sir.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Well, Mr. Castor-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Mr. Castro, let’s look at your report, what you wrote in the report about Ms. Williams.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So if we could put up slide six, please. And sir, you made the same point that you tried to make to discount her testimony. You said, “She testified that although she found the call to be unusual, she did not raise concerns to her supervisor.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir. Sir, when you said that although she found the call to be unusual, that wasn’t accurate. That’s not what she said about the call. She didn’t say that it was just unusual, did she?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That’s not all she said about it, was it?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, that was you in the minority
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	I’m happy to read it. Jennifer Williams testified that “although she found the call to be unusual,” she did not raise concerns to her supervisor.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Isn’t it a fact, sir, that Ms. Williams said a lot more than that?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So in here it says that you said Ms. Williams said that she found it to be “unusual” and nothing more.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Let’s look at like seven if we may.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Let’s look at, it says “unusual,” correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	No, it says unusual. Isn’t it a fact, sir, that what Ms. Williams says is it struck her as unusual and inappropriate. Isn’t that correct, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That’s what she said in her testimony.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	In your staff report you left out the “inappropriate” part, didn’t you?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So, sir, let me ask you. Were you as fair to the American people in describing what Ms. Williams said as you were in describing everything else in your report?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Well, let’s look at what else Ms. Williams said. Can we put up slide eight? This is from Ms. Williams’ public testimony at 34.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	She said, “I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature given that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, you left that out of your staff report, too, didn’t you?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, did you leave that out of your report, yes or no?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	I’m telling you you did.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And you have an explanation where you said Ms. Williams said that the call was unusual, when she in fact, she said it was unusual and inappropriate and of a political nature because it raised the Vice President who she recognized was a political opponent of the President.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	That’s not my question. My question is why did you misquote Ms. Williams in terms of-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	… Why did you do it?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So you stand… So from the standard that you apply to your fact finding in your report, you believe that it was entirely proper to say that Ms. Williams found the call to be unusual when, in fact, she found the call to be unusual and inappropriate and of a political nature given that the former Vice President is a political opponent of the President. Is that your testimony sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, is that your testimony? No you didn’t.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And sir, you invoked, sir, you invoked Mr.-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, you invoked-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Thank you, thank you Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Castor, you just invoked Tim Morrison. He was someone on the call, too, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And let me put up slide nine of Mr. Morrison’s testimony on page 38 of his public testimony. And Mr. Morrison said… Well, the question was, question by Mr. Goldman. You heard the call. You recognized that President Trump was not discussing the talking points that the NSC had prepared based on official US policy and was instead talking about the investigations that Fiona Hill had warned you about. And then you reported it immediately to the NSC legal advisor, is that the correct [inaudible 01:11:39] events here?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And Mr. Morrison said, “That’s correct.” Before I ask you, Mr. Castor, let me ask you, Mr. Goldman, earlier, before your presentation, we showed the testimony of Ms. Hill where she referred to what President Trump was trying to do as running a domestic political errand. Is that what you intended to ask Mr. Morrison about in your question to him?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And what was the significance to you that Mr. Morrison who Mr. Castor has, himself, relied on and invoked twice today where he said that he understood these were the investigations that Fiona Hill had warned him about, warned him about. What did you understand that to mean?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And was she expressing the view that President Trump had chose his own personal political interest over the foreign policy positions that Ms. Hill was trying to pursue?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And what was two and two again?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And what is four in this investigation, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Yep. Turning to you, Mr.-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, there’s no question.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, let me-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, let me ask you, sir. Sir, you said-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Thank you.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, I believe it was your testimony, because I wrote it down, that Democrats are about blocking info when they should be seeking information.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Okay. And then you said that the Trump administration has, in fact, cooperated and facilitated congressional oversight investigations. Is that correct, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Am I, just yes or no. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So let me ask you about this call, sir. Robert Blair-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Robert Blair who was on this call, the Trump administration, the President, himself, directed him not to appear and give testimony, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	No, I’m asking. Did the President direct him not to appear and give testimony? Yes or no.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	He was not allowed to come under the terms set by the House Intelligence Committee, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	The Trump administration directed him not to come, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	John Eisenberg was directed not to come, correct? The lawyer-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	But he was directed not to come, the lawyer who Lt. Col. Vindman went to, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So he was directed not to come, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, let me ask you this. Was is US policy of July 26 to request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, is that a no? It was not US policy to look into Joe Biden?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, let me show you what slide 10, testimony of, again, Lt. Col. Vindman.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And he was asked, “Are you aware of any written product from the National Security Council suggesting that investigations into the 2020 elections, the Bidens, or Burisma are part of the official policy of the United States?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	“No, I’m not.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now let me go also to Tim Morrison, who you invoked. If we could go to slide 11. Mr. Morrison was asked by our own Congressman Swalwell, who is also on the Intelligence Committee and said, I’m going to pick up in the middle of that long question. It said, “The one call that you listened to between the President of the United States and the President of Ukraine, the President of the United States priorities were to investigate the Bidens and I’m asking you, sir, why didn’t you follow up on the President’s priorities when you talked to the Ukrainians?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Mr. Morrison said, “Sir, I did not understand it as a policy objective.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Mr. Goldman, let me ask you. There was a package prepared before that call of what President Trump was supposed to talk about with President Zelensky, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And am I correct, sir, that one of the things that he was supposed to talk about that was in his prepared remarks was the anti-corruption platform of President Zelensky that he ran and won on, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Did President Trump mention corruption once in his call with Mr. Zelensky?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Did he mention looking into anything other than the two investigations that were politically helpful to him, the 2016 election investigation and the investigation of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	No.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And Mr. Castor, in fairness, you’ll be able to answer questions asked by minority counsel when it’s their turn. I have 45 minutes so let me ask you-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Mr. Castor, if I can finish… Let me finish, sir. Let me ask you this, sir. Sir, there were two lawyers mentioned on the call. We’ve heard testimony already, President Trump said to President Zelensky that he should speak to two people, his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani and the Attorney General Barr, correct.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Okay. Immediately after this call memorandum was released, isn’t it the case that Attorney General Barr and the Department of Justice issued a statement about his role in all this?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Let’s put up the statement, slide 13 please. From the Department of Justice, the President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine on this or any other subject. So, Mr. Goldman, is it fair to say that the Attorney General didn’t want anything to do with these investigations that President Trump had raised with President Zelensky on the call?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now, the other lawyer on the call, Rudy Giuliani, he, however, he was more than happy to continue to be involved in trying to get Ukraine to investigate President Trump’s political rival, Joe Biden, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And sir, Mr. Castro, you would agree… You wrote in your report that Rudy Giuliani, that the Ukrainians themselves, knew that Rudy Giuliani, the President’s personal lawyer was a conduit to convince President Trump that President Zelensky was a serious reformer, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir, wasn’t that what you said in your report?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And he was a conduit… Let me put a slide, 14, if I may and we actually have your report here. And it says, the Ukrainians knew that he, meaning Rudy Giuliani, was a conduit to convince President Trump that President Zelensky was serious about reform. Is that what you wrote in your report, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Okay. And, in fact, during the call, President Trump asked President Zelensky to speak directly to his personal lawyer about Ukrainian matters that President Trump was interested in, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Yes. And, in fact, President Zelensky said, oh we already knew that and he’s been in touch with my aides, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Right, because they knew that Mr. Giuliani was a conduit to the President and if they made Mr. Giuliani happy, they’d make President Trump happy.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Well, sir, you agree that President Giuliani, before the July 25th call and after was pushing for the Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, isn’t that correct. Yes or no.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Well, let’s take a look. If we could put up slide 16, the New York Times article you referred to.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	All right and the article says, I’ll read it. “Mr. Giuliani” and this is dated May 9, 2019, before the call, “Mr. Giuliani said he plans to travel to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in the coming days and wants to meet with the nation’s president-elect to urge him to pursue inquiries…” and then it continues “that allies of the White House contend could yield new information about two matters of intense interest to Mr. Trump. One is the origin of the Special Counsel’s investigation.” It goes on to describe it.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	New sentence. “The other is the involvement of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Okay. And now that was in the New York Times article. And-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	If we… Not yet. If we could continue the rest of the article, to the next slide, which is slide 17. This is the same article.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And Mr. Giuliani was very explicit when he was interviewed. He said, “And this isn’t foreign policy” I’m now quoting the words that are highlighted. He says, “It will be very, very helpful to my client. My only client is the President of the United States. He’s the one I have an obligation to report to him what happened regarding the Ukraine.” Now, sir, were you aware on that same day, Mr. Giuliani gave an interview about what he intended to do? And let’s go to slide 18.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	This is from RealClear Politics. And it should be on the screen in front of you as well. And what Mr. Giuliani said about the Ukraine, he said, “It’s a big story. It’s a dramatic story. And I guarantee you, Joe Biden will not get to election day without this being investigated. Not because I want to see him investigated. The collateral to what I was doing.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So, sir, and you agree, election day refers to the 2020 election where President Trump will be running for reelection.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Okay, so that was my only question to you. You’ll have a chance to answer questions to minority counsel.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now, and President Trump, let me show you slide-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Sir you’ll have an opportunity to talk about that when minority counsel questions you.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Let me go to slide 19, please. And the President says, he’s being interviewed now the same-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	So, my question to you, sir, is this tweet… what they’re talking about? Well, let me ask you, Mr. Goldman, you haven’t had a chance in a while. This tweet. Is that referring to a personal political issue of president Trump or official US policy?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Please, do.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, sir, you already explained that on May 23rd, when the official folks who went to the inauguration of president Zelensky came back to tell the president how impressed they were. The only thing he had to say to them was “Talk to Rudy.” He was taking his official government people responsible for Ukraine and handing them over to Rudy Giuliani so that they could work with him for the issues that he was focused on for the president as evidenced in the tweet. Is that fair?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Okay. In fact, let me show you what is slide 22, if I may? That you understood the Ukrainians recognized how important Rudy Giuliani was. And, satisfying him in order to stay on good terms with president Trump?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, in fact, this is the senior aide to president Zelensky saying to ambassador Volker on August 13th, which, is obviously after the July 25th call, “Thank you for meeting and your clear and very logical position. Will be great meet with you before my departure and discuss. I feel that the key for many things is Rudy and I am ready to talk to him with him at any point. Please. Let me know when you can meet. Audrey.” And again, that’s rooted… am I right? That’s the Ukrainians recognize that Rudy Giuliani, who’s demanding the investigation of Mr. Trump’s political rival, was key. To getting anything done. Correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Thank you Mr. Goldman. Further evidence of the meticulous investigation that chairman Schiff and his staff with you directed. We will stand corrected. Thank you. And, I will take that and ask that the record reflect that, that that is the correct date. In either case, Rudy was key whenever it was said, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, now let me ask, sir. Let me put up slide 24. And, Mr. Goldman, am I correct that there came a point in time when president Trump through his chief of staff, Mr. Mick Mulvaney, ordered that the approved military aid to Ukraine be withheld. As you previously indicated? Correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, this is the testimony of the people who were involved. Mr Kent said, when this happened, “There was great confusion among the rest of us. Because, we didn’t understand why that had happened. Since there was unanimity that this aid was in our national interest. It just surprised us all.” Mr. Holmes. “And, then, you had the additional hold of the security assistance with no explanation whatsoever. And, we still have an explanation… and, we still don’t have an explanation for why that happened or in the way that happened.” Ms. Croft, “The only reason given was that the order came at the direction of the president.” So sir, let me ask a question. Did all the agencies involved believe that the aid should be given?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, in the minority staff report. And, in Mr. Caster’s testimony earlier, he said the US government did not convey the pause to the Ukrainians. Well, that wasn’t correct, was it? Didn’t Mr. Sondland convey that? According to Mr. Sondland’s affidavit and testimony.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	We’ll put up the slide.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	We can put up the actual affidavit that mister… ambassador Sondland, the president Trump’s ambassador to the European union, that he swore to under penalties of perjury. And he says, if we go read the highlighted, which, is also in front of you, “I now recall speaking individually with Mr. Yermak where I said that… where I said, to Mr. Yermak, the Ukrainian aid, that we’re…” I’m going back to the quote “That resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.” Is that correct, sir?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, the statement that they had been talking about, let me put up a slide that we put together, slide 27.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, do you recall, sir, that, in the draft statement that the Ukrainians were going to have president Zelensky gifts so they could… was that statement on their minds so they could get a white house meeting and satisfying president Trump and have the aid released?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, am I correct that Mr. Yermak gave a statement where he did not make any reference to vice president Biden, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, then, was that Rudy Giuliani who said, in the second one, that it had to include a reference that they were going to investigate Burisma in the 2016 election?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, what did Burisma stand for? Did all your witnesses say they had an understanding of what that meant? Or, did the witnesses say that?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, is that why, that’s how Mr. Giuliani publicly referred to it often as Burisma and vice president Biden, correct?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And, did the Ukrainians complain repeatedly? We talked a little bit about it. That they didn’t want to be a pawn and US democratic politics by helping president Trump’s reelection campaign by making such a statement.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	I want to go back to you, Mr. Caster. You said that when president Trump said to ambassador Sondland on September 17th, that he had no quid pro quo. You said he had no reason-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	September 9th. You said he had no reason to be any less than candid. That’s what you said. No reason to be any less than candidate. Let me show you, sir, what happened though on September 5th. Let me show you slide 52.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Days before he made that statement, The Washington Post printed an article that says Trump tries to force Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 elections. And, goes on to describe some of those efforts. And, sir, let me show you whether president Trump was aware of that article before he volunteered no quid pro quo as a defense. Let me show you a tweet by president Trump on slide 53.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Now, and, again, this is, he is putting out a tweet that is essentially saying the Democrats… following up the article that they’re pursuing impeachment. Again, showing awareness that this has now been reported on. So, Mr. Goldman, is it fair to say what Mr. Caster said, that Mr. Trump… president Trump, had no reason to be any less than candid about saying no quid pro quo?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	Would you agree that Joe Biden was a leading democratic contender, the face President Trump in 2020.
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	You disagree with it? So sir, it’s your testimony-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	#NAME?
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	No, you can’t. Mr. Castor-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer	Lawyer	And Mr. Castor, in fairness you’ll be able to answer questions asked by minority counsel when it’s their turn. I have 45 minutes. So let me ask you-
2019-12-09	Barry Berke	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you, Mr. Chairman, [crosstalk 00:00:01], Ranking Member Collins, and all the members. Before I had the great honor of being a counsel for this committee, my young son asked me a question. He said, “Dad, does the president have to be a good person?” Like many questions by young children, it had a certain clarity but it was hard to answer. I said, “Son, it is not a requirement that the president be a good person, but that is the hope.” And it is not a requirement that the president be a good person. That is not why we are here today. That is not the issue.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your opening statement, Ambassador Sondland, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right, because reviewing these documents has helped you to remember the events that we’re asking about. Is that correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Because you acknowledge of course, that when you can place a document and a date and a context, it helps to jog your memory.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And so you would agree that for people unlike yourself who take notes, that that is very helpful to their own recollection of events, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, no. You are not a note taker, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But you would agree that people who do take contemporaneous notes generally are more able to remember things then people who don’t.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And there are additional documents that you’ve been unable to obtain, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I think you even said in your opening statement that the State Department prevented you and your staff from trying to gather more documents. Is that correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Which documents?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And who at the State Department prevented you from doing that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But certainly based on the additional memory that you have gained over the past few weeks from reading the testimony of others, based on their notes and reviewing your own documents, you have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26th in that restaurant in Kiev, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Certainly, so that’s one way memory works isn’t it? And you were sitting in a restaurant with David Holmes in Kiev, right, having lunch?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And it was a meeting, a one-on-one meeting you had with Andriy Yermak?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And particularly if that person took notes at that meeting.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Or sat outside the door when you didn’t let them in?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you had also met with President Zelensky among others that day, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you called President Trump from your cell phone from the restaurant, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And this was not a secure line, was it?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you worry that a foreign government may be listening to your phone call with the President of the United States?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you don’t recall the specifics of holding your phone far away from your ear as Mr. Holmes testified, but you have no reason to question his recollection of that, do you?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, he also testified that you confirmed to President Trump that you were in Ukraine at the time and that President Zelensky quote loves your ass unquote. Do you recall saying that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Holmes then said that he heard President Trump ask “Is he,” meaning Zelensky, going to do the investigation?” To which you replied, “He’s going to do it.” And then you added that President Zelensky will do anything that you, meaning President Trump, asked him to. Do you recall that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He was not only willing, he was very eager, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Because Ukraine depends on the United States as its most significant ally, isn’t that correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Just so we understand, you were in Kiev the day after President Trump spoke to President Zelensky on the phone and you now know from reading the call record that in that phone call he requested a favor for President Zelensky to do investigations related to the Bidens and the 2016 election, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you met with President Zelensky and his aides on the day after that phone call and then you had a conversation with President Trump from your cell phone from a restaurant terrace, and he asked you whether President Zelensky will do the investigations. And you responded that he’s going to do them or it, and that President Zelensky will do anything you ask them to do. Is that an accurate recitation of what happened there?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But you don’t have any reason to dispute Mr. Holmes’ recollection, correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	After you hung up with the President, Mr. Holmes testified about a conversation that you and he had, where he says that you told Mr. Holmes that the President does not care about Ukraine, but the President used the more colorful language including a four letter word that you just referenced to, you’ve just referenced. Do you recall saying that to Mr. Holmes?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But he was a big fan of the investigations?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, Mr. Holmes said that you said that President Trump only cares about the “big stuff” that benefits himself. Is that something that you would have said at the time?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Holmes also remembers that you told him in giving an example of the big stuff, the Biden investigation that Rudy Giuliani was pushing. Do you recall that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But do you recall saying, at least referring to an investigation that Rudy Giuliani was pushing, is that something that you likely would have said?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, even if you don’t recall specifically mentioning the Biden investigation to David Holmes, we know that it was certainly on President Trump’s mind. Because just the day before in his call with President Zelensky, he mentions specifically the Biden investigation. And I want to show you that exhibit or that excerpt from the call on July 25th, where President Trump says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.”
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Zelensky then responds without reference to the company that he’s referring to. And two witnesses yesterday said that when President Zelensky actually said the company, he said Burisma. So you would agree that regardless of whether you knew about the connection to the Bidens, at the very least, that you now know that that’s what President Trump wanted at the time through the Burisma investigation.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And at this time you were aware of the President’s desire along with Rudy Giuliani to do these investigations, including the 2016 election interference investigation, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you said President Trump had directed you to talk, you and the others to talk to Rudy Giuliani at the Oval Office on May 23rd, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right, you understood that Mr. Giuliani spoke for the President, correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, President Trump also made that clear to President Zelensky in that same July 25th phone call, he said, “Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the Mayor of New York city, a great mayor and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy.” And after this, President Trump then mentions Mr. Giuliani twice more in that call. Now from Mr. Giuliani by this point, you understood that in order to get that White House meeting that you wanted President Zelensky to have and that President Zelensky desperately wanted to have, that Ukraine would have to initiate these two investigations. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right, because Giuliani and President Trump didn’t actually care if they did them, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Announced publicly?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you of course, recognized that there would be political benefits to a public announcement as opposed to a private confirmation, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But you never heard anyone say that they really wanted them to do the investigations? Just that they want it to announce-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now your July 26th call with the President was not the only time that you spoke to the President surrounding that Ukraine trip, was it?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So that would be on July 25th, the day before?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So that’s two private telephone calls with President Trump in the span of two days, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You had direct access then to President Trump, correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well he certainly took your call twice as it related to Ukraine on these two days, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now the morning of July 25th, you texted Ambassador Volker and we could bring up the next text exchange at 7:54 AM and you said, “Call ASAP.” Ambassador Volker did not respond to you for another hour and a half and he said, “Hi Gordon, got your message, had a great lunch with Yermak and then passed your message to him. He will see you tomorrow. Think everything in place.” Volker though, an hour before that and about a half an hour before the phone call, had texted Andriy Yermak, a top aid for President Zelensky and he wrote, “Good lunch, thanks. Heard from White House, assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck. See you tomorrow.”
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Sondland, was this message that Kurt Volker passed to Andryi Yermak the message you left for Kurt Volker on that voicemail that he referenced?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You don’t have any reason to think it wasn’t, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And if Ambassador Volker testified that he did get that message from you, you have no reason-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And if Ambassador Volker testified that he did get that message from you, you have no reason to doubt that.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, is it fair to say that this message is what you received from President Trump in that phone call that morning?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But the sequence certainly makes sense, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You talked to President Trump, you told Kurt Volker call you, you left a message for Kurt Volker. Kurt Volker sent this text message to Andrei Yermak to prepare Presidents Zelensky, and then President Trump had a phone call where President Zelensky spoke very similar to what was in this text message. Right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you would agree that the message in this, that is expressed here is that President Zelensky needs to convince Trump that he will do the investigations in order to nail down the date for a visit to Washington, DC. Is that correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, I’m going to move ahead in time to the end of August and early September when you came to believe, I believe as you testified, that it wasn’t just the White House meeting that was contingent on the announcement of these investigations that the president wanted, but security assistance as well. You testified that in the absence of any credible explanation for the hold on security assistance, you came to the conclusion that like the White House visit, the aid was conditioned on the investigations that President Trump wanted. Is that what you said in your opening statement?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, let me break this down with you. By this time you, and many top officials, knew that that coveted White House meeting for President Zelensky was conditioned on these investigations, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you. And that includes Secretary Pompeo right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And well, Secretary Pompeo?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And acting chief of staff Mulvaney.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you testified that this was a quid pro quo, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you, at this point by the end of August, knew that the aide had been held up for at least six weeks. Is that correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And even though you searched for reasons, you were never given a credible explanation, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And no one you spoke to thought that the aid should be held to your knowledge, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And now, by this point, at the end of August it went public and the Ukrainians knew about it. Right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, President Zelensky brought it up at that September 1st meeting with Vice President Pence that you were at. Right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you understood the Ukrainians received no credible explanation, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, is this kind of a two plus two equals four conclusion that you reached?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Is the only logical conclusion to you that, given all of these factors, that the aid was also a part of this quid pro quo?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, I want to go back to that conversation that you had with Vice President Pence right before that meeting in Warsaw. You indicated that you said to him that you were concerned that the delay in the aid was tied to the issue of investigations. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Vice President Pence just nodded his head?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well he didn’t say, “Gordon, what are you talking about?”
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He didn’t say, “What investigations?”
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, after this meeting, you discussed this a pull aside, you had with Mr. Yermak where you relayed your belief that they needed to announce these investigations prior to the aid being released. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And obviously you had been speaking with Mr. Yermak for quite a while about a public announcement of these investigations. Right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And so, you indicated to him that in addition to the White House meeting, security aid was now also involved in that.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, I’m going to show you another text exchange you had on September 1st where Ambassador Taylor says to you, “Are we now saying that security assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations?” And you respond, “Call me.” Ambassador Taylor recalls that he did call you and you did have a conversation, and in that conversation you told Ambassador Taylor that the announcement of these investigations by President Zelensky needed to be public and that that announcement was conditioned on, that announcement would ultimately release the aid. Do you recall that conversation with Ambassador Taylor?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, in his testimony, Ambassador Taylor says that you said that President Trump had told you that he wanted President Zelensky to state publicly as of September 1st. Do you have any reason to doubt Ambassador Taylor’s testimony, which he said was based on his meticulous contemporaneous notes?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, you didn’t talk to President Trump when Ambassador Taylor says that that’s what you told him? Is that your testimony here?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, you never heard those specific words-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right? But-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And, well, let’s move ahead because you have another conversation a little bit later that both Tim Morrison and Ambassador Taylor recount. But in this September 1st conversation, Ambassador Taylor also testified under oath that you said that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Do you recall using that expression?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You also testified, or Ambassador Taylor rather, testified that you told him that you had made a mistake in telling the Ukrainians that only the White House meeting was conditioned on the announcement of the investigations, and that in fact everything was, including the security assistance. Do you remember saying that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8th, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And so, this was September 8th at 11:20 in the morning and Ambassador Taylor responds immediately, “Now is fine with me.” And if we could go to the next exchange, Ambassador Taylor then, 15 minutes later says, “Gordon and I just spoke,” or 20 minutes later rather, “I can brief you if you and Gordon don’t connect,” speaking to Ambassador Volker. Then Ambassador Taylor an hour later says, “The nightmare is they give the interview and don’t get the security assistance. The Russians love it and I quit.” You would agree that in this text message after you had spoken earlier, an hour earlier with Ambassador Taylor that he is linking the security assistance to this interview, this public announcement by President Zelensky. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, Ambassador Taylor testified that you did have a conversation with him at that point, and that you told him that just as your text message indicates, you did have a conversation with President Trump prior to that text message. Does that help to refresh your recollection that you in fact spoke to President Trump at that time?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump as you indicated in that text, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that after that conversation, you were still under the impression that the aid was contingent on these public announcements?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, you weren’t dissuaded then. Right? Because you still thought that the aid was conditioned on the public announcement of the investigations, after speaking to President Trump.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And President Trump did not dissuade you of that in the conversation that you acknowledge you had with him?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s not what I’m asking Ambassador Sondland. I’m just saying, you still believed that the security assistance was conditioned on the investigation after you spoke to President Trump? Yes or no.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Ambassador Taylor also testified that, and Mr. Morrison, both of them testified, that you told them that President Trump said there was no quid pro quo, which you also included in that text message that you’re referred. But then you went on and they had slight variations as to what you told them, but then you said that, to Ambassador Taylor, that President Zelensky himself, not the prosecutor general, needed to clear things up in public or there would be a stalemate, and Mr. Morrison recounted something similar. You don’t have any reason to doubt that both of their very similar recollections of the conversations they had with you, do you Ambassador Sondland?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But as of September 9th you understood, did you not, that President Trump, either himself or through his agents, required that President Zelensky make a public announcement of the two investigations that President Trump cared about in order to get both the White House meeting and to release the security assistance. Is that correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you again Ambassador Sondland. We do appreciate your efforts to refresh your recollection to the documents and we understand we share your frustration in not having the documents to help guide this investigation. So we do appreciate those efforts. One of the documents that you provided to us goes back to the conversation you and and the chairman were having about Mr. Mulvaney. and you had been trying for some time before the July 25th call to set up that call. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct. Yes. And I want to show you an email that you reference in your opening statement that is a July 19th email. And who is this from?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It’s from you, I believe.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now who is the group?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And who’s Robert Blair?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you’ve already told us that Lisa Kenna is the executive secretary for secretary Pompeo. Who’s Brian McCormack?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then we see Mr. Mulvaney, Secretary Perry and Secretary Pompeo. Can you read what you wrote on July 19th to this group please?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So Sunday was the 21st which was the date of the parliamentary elections in Ukraine. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. When you say, “Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will, ‘turn over every stone,'” what do you mean there?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Later that evening, Secretary Perry responds just to you and Brian McCormack saying, “Mick, just confirm the call being set up for tomorrow by NSCRP.” And then a little later, Mr. Mulvaney replies to all saying, “I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.” Were these the only responses that you received to this email?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No one wrote back to you and said, “What are you talking about in terms of these investigations and turning over every stone?”
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So that would explain why it was moved from the next day, July 20th to the 25th right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But Ambassador Bolton is not on this is he?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now you were asked by Mr. Caster if there are any other key witnesses who might be able to help with our investigation and you mentioned Brian McCormack. The chief of staff for Secretary Perry.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You are aware that the committee subpoenaed him, are you not?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that he refused to come testify. Are you also aware that Mr Mulvaney was subpoenaed by the committee and refused to come testify?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Are you also aware that Robert Blair was subpoenaed and refused to come testify?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that Secretary Perry was asked to come testify and refused.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So would you include them include as well as Secretary Pompeo as key witnesses that would be able to provide some additional information on this inquiry?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now this was not the first time, as you indicated, that Mr. Mulvaney heard about these investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, he certainly didn’t indicate… He certainly indicated a familiarity with what you were talking about in this July 19th email. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. Now you’ve said that you don’t have a recollection of referencing Mulvaney in the July 10th meeting and Ambassador Bolton’s office. Is that right or-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So when both Fiona Hill and Colonel Vindman testified that in response to a question from Ukrainian officials at that July 10th meeting about scheduling a White House visit that you said, “Well I spoke with Mr. Mulvaney and it will be scheduled after they announce these investigations.” Do you have any reason to dispute that characterization?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So if they both remembered it and they both then went and spoke to the NSC legal advisor about it, you would trust that whatever they relay to the NSC legal advisor would likely be an accurate reflection?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	This email indicates that you spoke to President Zelensky and were relaying what he said to very senior officials. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sorry, the July 19th email. Where you say, the subject is, “I talked to Zelensky just now.”
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was there some sort of assurance that President Zelensky needed to provide about what he would say to President Trump in order just to get the phone call?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So just to place you in time, we’re going to get to that draft statement, which was in August, this is July 19th before the July 25th call. Do you remember whether there was a need from any of the White House officials or other national security officials for President Zelensky to provide some assurance of what he would say to President Trump before a phone call? Not the meeting, but a phone call was scheduled.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And when you say there was no such statement that took place, what do you mean?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right, but we’re not talking about a public statement. What I was asking is whether President Zelensky needed to relay to you or the other American officials that he would assure President Trump that he would do these investigations in a phone call. That is-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you had been discussing this phone call for several weeks now, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then right after you sent this email assuring the others that he will discuss the investigations and we’ll turn over every stone, the Burisma in 2016 election investigations, Mr. Mulvaney responded that he asked to set up the call for the next day. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now let’s go to that press statement that you were discussing in August and you testified, I believe, that you understood that Rudy Giuliani was representing the president’s interests with regard to Ukraine. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And when you all, who do you mean we all?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In August, you and Ambassador Volker were coordinating with Andriy Yermak, the Zelensky aid, about a press statement. And I want to pull up some of the text exchanges that you were referring to, which as you acknowledge, helps you refresh your recollection. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, he’s not on any of these text messages, so perhaps he was, he does not remember that. But let’s go to the first one. Is it working? On August 9th? There’s an exchange between Ambassador Volker and you where you are discussing setting up, we’ll try to bring it up in a second, but I’ll just summarize for you. You’re discussing trying to set up a White House meeting. Here it is. And you say Morrison, “Ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.” Ambassador Volker says, “Excellent, how did you sway him?” You said, “Not sure I did. I think POTUS really wants the deliverable.” What did you mean there?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And how did you know that the president wanted the deliverable?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Going to the next exhibit, exhibit 10, or August 10th rather. This is between you and Andriy Yermak. What did you say initially in this exchange?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Mr. Yermak responds, “Hello, good. My proposal, we received date and then we make general statement with discussed things. Once we have a date, we’ll call for a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of U.S. Ukraine relationship, including among other things, Burisma and election meddling and investigations.” And you respond, “Got it.” That was your understanding of what the statement had to say to satisfy Mr. Giuliani, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then ultimately to satisfy the POTUS deliverable?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now the next day you write an email to Ulrich Brechbuhl and Lisa Kenna. Are you able to see that on your-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. What is the subject of the email?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And can you read what you wrote there?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in your opening statement you said that the specifics… What did the specifics represent?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And when you say the boss, who do you mean by that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And the invitation is what?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Lisa Kenner responds, “Gordon, I’ll pass to S.” And S is Secretary Pompeo?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you, Lisa. Now two days later, you have a text exchange with Ambassador Volker again, and this is at the end of it, but the earlier text, which we don’t have here, you may recall includes the press statement, the revised press statement that includes Burisma and the 2016 election. Do you recall that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But you ultimately remembered that after your conversation with Mr. Giuliani, you did pass along a statement to the Ukrainians that included Burisma and the 2016 election. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And ultimately the statement was not issued, was it?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And the White House meeting did not-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Still hasn’t occurred. But you certainly understood at that time, did you not, that it was the President’s direction and instruction that a White House meeting with presidents Zelensky would not occur until President Zelensky announced publicly the investigations that the president wanted, is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you now know that the investigations the president wanted, was an investigation into the Bidens and an investigation into the 2016 election?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I’m going to move ahead to August 22nd and you wrote an email to secretary Pompeo, directly to secretary Pompeo CC-ing Lisa Kenna with the subject of Zelensky. And could you please read what you wrote to secretary Pompeo?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And secretary Pompeo responds to you three minutes later. “Yes.” Now I want to unpack this a little bit. You said that in the middle, “Once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place.” What did you mean by that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So once that new prosecutor was in place, then Z, President Zelensky, “Should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to POTUS.” What did you mean by those issues of importance to POTUS?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Were you aware at this time that secretary Pompeo had listened in to the July 25th phone call?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	If he had, do you believe that he would fully understand what the issues of importance to POTUS related to Ukraine would be?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But now that you’ve read the phone call, it’s quite clear what the issues of importance to POTUS are.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	By an investigation and the 2016 election investigation. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Then it says, “Hopefully that will break the log jam.” Now, by this point, you were aware that security assistance had been on hold for about five weeks. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you understood that there was a lot of activity within the state department and elsewhere to try to get that hold lifted. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Just about everybody in the inner agency, meaning the national security apparatus, wanted to lift the hold and wanted the aid to go to Ukraine?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So what did you mean here when you said log jam?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what was holding that up?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But what was being held up?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Four days later, you said in your opening statement that you sent Rudy Giuliani’s contact information to John Bolton. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you know why he asked for that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you know that he was going to Ukraine the next day?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now in this email to Secretary Pompeo, you reference a trip to Warsaw. Ultimately the Vice President went on that trip.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that was the conversation that you’ve talked about where you testified earlier to that where you said that we really need to get these investigations from Ukraine in order to release the aid in the pre meeting.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Vice President Pence just nodded?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And didn’t respond in any way.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay, but you never specifically referenced the Bidens or Burisma in that meeting, did you?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that meeting was with a group. You were not alone with Vice President Pence.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you know that at that bilateral meeting with President Zelensky, I believe you testified earlier, that Vice President Pence did not mention these investigations at all, right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So your testimony is just simply in a pre meeting with a group of Americans before the bilateral meeting, you referenced the fact that Ukraine needed to do these investigations in order to lift the aid.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So that helped inform your presumption, correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So it wasn’t really a presumption you heard from Mr. Giuliani?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you understood at that point as we discussed, two plus two equals four that the aid was there as well.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. Well, I want to go ahead to… I want to go back on September 1st… Or I’m going to jump actually ahead to September 7th okay. When we discussed those text messages where you said there were multiple convos with President Zelensky and POTUS, you recall that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We could try to pull it up in a second, but you don’t remember? I showed it to you this morning.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you confirmed that that likely meant, as you said it did, that you spoke with President Trump. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You are relying pretty heavily in your testimony on the texts and emails that you are able to review. Is that right?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So certainly if someone else had contemporaneous texts, emails or notes, you would presume that what they were saying was accurate. Is that correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But certainly it would be a helpful refresher to anyone’s memory.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now you had a conversation on September 7th according to both Ambassador Taylor and Tim Morrison with Tim Morrison, where you told Mr. Morrison that President Trump told you that he was not asking for a quid pro quo, but that he did insist that President Zelensky go to a microphone and say that he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself. You don’t have any reason to dispute both Ambassador Taylor’s and Mr. Morrison’s testimony about that conversation, do you?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	On September 8th, you then had a conversation directly with Ambassador Taylor about this same phone call where Ambassador Taylor said that you confirmed that you spoke to President Trump, as he had suggested earlier to you, and that President Trump was adamant that President Zelensky himself, meaning not the prosecutor general, had to, “Clear things up and do it in public.” You don’t have any reason to think that Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his contemporaneous notes was-
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, Ambassador Taylor is quite clear that you said President Trump, Mr. Morrison is also quite clear that you said President Trump. You don’t have any reason to dispute their very specific recollections, do you?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then you also told Ambassador Taylor in that same conversation that if President Zelensky, rather you told President Zelensky and Andriy Yermak that although this was not a quid pro quo as the president had very clearly told you, it was however required for President Zelensky to clear things up in public or there would be a stalemate. You don’t have any reason to dispute Ambassador Taylor’s recollection of that conversation you had with President Zelensky, do you?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that you understood the stalemate referenced the aid, is that correct?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Taylor also described a comment that you made where you were trying to explain what President Trump’s view of this was. And you said that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks the person to pay up before signing the check. Do you recall saying that to Ambassador Taylor?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Ambassador Volker also said that you did.
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So just to summarize here, by the end of the first week of September, before the aid had been released, you had expressed twice to the Ukrainians that you understood that the investigations needed to be publicly announced on CNN in order for the aid to be released. Do you recall that?
2019-11-20	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that even though at some point you had calculated two plus two to equal four and therefore you believed that the aid was conditioned on the investigations, that you had a phone call with President Trump that you relayed to both Tim Morrison and Ambassador Taylor whose accounts of that conversation you do not dispute where President Trump confirmed that President Zelensky needed to publicly announce the investigations or otherwise, the obvious implication of the stalemate would be that the aid would not be released. Is that correct?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to both of you. Yesterday we heard testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland from the European Union, who testified that President Trump wanted Ukraine to announce the investigations into Biden, the Bidens of Burisma and the 2016 elections because they would benefit him politically, and that he used the leverage of that White House meeting and the security assistance to pressure President Zelensky to do so. Dr. Hill, you testified I believe that in mid-June Ambassador Sondland told you that he was in charge of Ukraine policy. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Who did he tell you had put him in charge of Ukraine policy?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Holmes, did you also understand that Ambassador Sondland had been given some authority over Ukraine policy from the President?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did he hold himself out as having direct contact and knowledge of the President?s priorities and interests?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now Mr. Holmes, I?m going to go to that July 26th date when you overheard the conversation between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump, and I?m going to ask you a little bit about the lead up to that conversation. Before the lunch that you described, you said that you accompanied Ambassadors Sondland, Volker, and Taylor to a meeting with President Zelensky. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you took notes at that meeting?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you reviewed those notes before you came here to testify today?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And they were helpful to refresh your recollection as to what happened, is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	During that meeting, President Zelensky said that on his phone call with President Trump the previous day, that three times President Trump had mentioned ?sensitive issues.? Did you understand what President Zelensky was referring to when he said the ?sensitive issues?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And after you read the call, what did you determine to be the sensitive issues that President Zelensky referenced?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	After this meeting with President Zelensky, you testified that Ambassador Sondland had a one-on-one meeting with Andre Yermack, a top aide to Zelensky, and that you were prohibited from going into that meeting to take notes. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And yesterday, Ambassador Sondland testified that he probably discussed the investigations with Mr. Yermack. Did Ambassador Sondland tell you at all what they discussed?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	"Now after this meeting with Mr. Yermack, you went to lunch; and can you just describe where you were sitting at the restaurant?"
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now you said that at some point Ambassador Sondland pulled out his cell phone and called President Trump. This was an unsecure cell phone, is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In the middle of a restaurant in Kiev?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now you said that you were able to hear President Trump?s voice through the receiver. How were you able to hear if it was not on speaker phone?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And so you were able to hear some of what President Trump said to President Zelensky, is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what did you hear President Trump say to ? I?m sorry, not President Zelensky, to Ambassador Sondland?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The President say to Ambassador Sondland?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So you heard President Trump
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So you heard President Trump ask Ambassador Sondland, ?Is he going to do the investigation?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What was Ambassador Sondland?s response?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And was that the end of the Ukraine portion of the conversation?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Afterwards, you described a follow on conversation that you had with Ambassador Sondland where you asked him, I think, generally what did President Trump think of Ukraine. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did Ambassador Sondland say to you?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did he use slightly more colorful language than that?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did he say that he does care about?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did he explain what he meant by ?big stuff?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, were you familiar with the Biden investigation that he referenced at that point?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And how do you have such a specific and clear recollection of this conversation with the President and your conversation with Ambassador Sondland.
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So just to summarize, during the phone call that you overheard Ambassador Sondland have with President Trump, you heard President Trump himself ask the only question you really heard him ask, I believe, is whether he was going to do the investigation, to which Ambassador Sondland responded that he would, and he would, in fact, do anything that President Zelensky wants. Is that an accurate recitation of what happened?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then after that call, you had a subsequent conversation with Ambassador Sondland where he, in sum and substance, told you that the President doesn?t care about Ukraine, he only cares about big stuff related to himself, and particularly the Biden investigation that Giuliani was pushing?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, a day before your lunch with Ambassador Sondland, President Trump did speak with President Zelensky, as you referred, and certainly the President made it clear to President Zelensky that he cared about the Biden investments. Now, neither of you did listen to this call, but as you testified, you both read it subsequent to its publication.
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Dr. Hill, you, during your time, two and a half years in the White House, listened to a number of presidential phone calls. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Can you estimate approximately how many?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Have you ever heard a call like this one that you read?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Understood. I?m really just focused on this one call that has been declassified and published, and just asking you whether you?d ever heard any presidential phone call along these lines.
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You said in your deposition testimony that you were very shocked and very saddened to read it.
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Why was that?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You also testified that you were concerned that this call was turning a White House meeting into some kind of asset. Do you recall that testimony?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Holmes, you indicate in your opening statement that the Chief of Staff to President Zelensky had indicated to you that in this phone call on July 25th, there was a discussion about personnel issues related to the Prosecutor General?s office. After you read the call, did you understand who and what that was referring to?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I believe you also said that President Lutsenko was the source of some of Mr. Giuliani?s public views and allegations, is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What was the US embassy, in Ukraine?s view, of Prosecutor General Lutsenko?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Is another way to describe that ?corrupt?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, I?m going to take a look at a couple of excerpts from this July 25th call with you, and the first one occurs right after President Zelensky thanked President Trump for the United States? support in the area of defense. And President Trump immediately then says, ?I would like you to do us a favor though, because our country has been through a lot, and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people, the server, they say Ukraine has it.
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Dr. Hill, is this a reference to this debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine interference in the 2016 election that you discussed in your opening statement as well as with Chairman Schiff?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And it is your understanding that there is no basis for these allegations, is that correct?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, isn?t it also true that some of President Trump?s most senior advisors had informed him that this theory of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election was false?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So is it your understanding then that President Trump disregarded the advice of his senior officials about this theory, and instead listened to Rudy Giuliani?s views?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I also then want to just show one other exhibit that goes back to what you were testifying earlier, Dr. Hill, about Russia?s interest in promoting this theory. This is an excerpt from a February 2nd, 2017, news conference with President Putin and Prime Minister Orban of Hungary, where Putin says, ?Second, as we all know, during the presidential campaign in the United States, the Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral position in favor of one candidate. More than that, certain oligarchs, certainly with the approval of the political leadership, funded this candidate, or female candidate, to be more precise.
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Holmes, you spent three years as well in the US embassy in Russia. Why would it be to Vladimir Putin?s advantage to promote this theory of Ukraine interference?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And, Dr. Hill, by promoting this theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, was President Trump adopting Vladimir Putin?s view over his own senior advisors and intelligence officials?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, back in May of this year, do you recall that President Trump had a phone conversation in early May with President Putin?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that he also then met in mid May with Prime Minister Orban, who had joined President Putin at this press conference?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, that happened in between the time when President Zelensky was elected on April 21st and his inauguration on May 20th, is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, isn?t it true that President Trump had asked Vice President Pence to attend the inauguration after his phone call with President Zelensky on April 21st?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And is that also your recollection, Mr. Holmes, that you wanted Vice President Pence to attend?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Jennifer Williams from the Office of the Vice President testified here that on May 13th, which is the same day that President Trump met with Prime Minister Orban, that the President called off Vice President Pence?s trip for unknown reasons, but before the inauguration date had been scheduled. And, Dr. Hill, were you aware also that during that period, there was a lot of publicity, and I think, Mr. Holmes, you referenced this in your opening statement as well, about Rudy Giuliani?s interest in these investigations in Ukraine?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And around this time, Dr. Hill, you also, I believe, testified that Ambassador Bolton had expressed some views to you about Mr. Giuliani?s interest in Ukraine. Do you recall what you said?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What he said to you, rather?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you understand what he meant by that?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did he mean?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Mr. Holmes, did the Ukrainians understand that Rudy Giuliani represented the President?s views?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Let?s focus on the inauguration for a minute. You had escorted, for lack of a better word, the US delegation around?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Who was on the official delegation?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did the delegation have a meeting with President Zelensky that you attended?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You testified previously that Secretary Perry gave a list of some sort to President Zelensky at that meeting. Do you recall that?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Do you know who was on that list?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Are they Americans?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, do you also recall that Colonel Vindman spoke to Presidents Zelensky in that meeting?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did he say to President Zelensky in terms of some of the issues that we?re addressing here in this investigation?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was it your understanding that President Zelensky and the Ukrainians were already starting to feel some pressure to conduct these political investigations?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Those were the ones related to Biden and Burisma and the 2016 election?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Dr. Hill, you also testified that around this same time in May, you learned that President Trump was receiving information from someone else at the National Security Council. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did that person indicate that the president thought that was the director of Ukraine?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Who is the director of Ukraine?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Who did this individual in the Executive secretary?s office refer to?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you know who that was?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Kasha Patel did not work on Ukraine matters that you oversaw, is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The indication is that Kash Patel had provided some information directly to the president without your knowledge?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, I want to go back to the July 25th call right now where President Trump, in another excerpt, asked President Zelensky about his potential political opponent, Vice President Joe Biden. In this excerpt, the president said ?The other thing, there?s a lot of talk about Biden?s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Dr. Hill, this was, of course, one of the allegations that Rudy Giuliani was pushing, is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now confirmed in this July 25th call that the president was also interested in it?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassadors Volker and Sondland have tried to draw a distinction between their understanding of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens. But Dr. Hill, was it apparent to you that when President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, or anyone else was pushing for an investigation into Burisma that the reason why they wanted that investigation related to what President Trump said here, the Bidens.
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Holmes, you also understood that Burisma was code for Bidens?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Do you think that anyone involved in Ukraine matters in the spring and the summer would understand that as well?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Dr. Hill, are you aware of any evidence to support the allegations against Vice President Biden?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In fact, Mr. Holmes, the former Prosecutor General of Ukraine, who Vice President Biden encouraged to fire was actually corrupt, is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And was not pursuing corruption investigations and prosecutions, right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In fact, removing that corrupt prosecutor general was part of the United States anti-corruption policy. Isn?t that correct?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Dr. Hill, you indicated earlier that you had understood that a White House meeting was conditioned on the pursuit by Ukraine of these investigations, and I want to focus on the July 10th meeting in the White House where that came to light. You indicated that, in your testimony, that there was a large meeting that Ambassador Bolton ran where Ambassadors Sondland, Volcker and Secretary Perry also attended. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Why were they included in that meeting with two Ukrainian officials about national security matters?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, toward the end of this meeting, the Ukrainians raised their ongoing desire for an Oval Office meeting. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What happened after they did that?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did Ambassador Sondland say who his agreement on this White House meeting was with?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did he say later?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was he specific at that point, later about the investigations that he was referring to?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, did you have a conversation with Ambassador Bolton after this subsequent meeting with Ambassador Sondland?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The subsequent meeting, or after both meetings when you spoke to him and relayed to him what Ambassador Sondland said, what did Ambassador Bolton say to you?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. But just in that second meeting, what did he say?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What was that specific instruction?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did you understand him to mean by the ?drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you go speak to the lawyers?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You relayed everything that you just told us and more?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Holmes, you have testified that by late August you had a clear impression that the security assistance hold was somehow connected to the investigations that President Trump wanted. How did you reach that clear conclusion?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Because the investigations were still being pursued?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And the hold was still remaining without explanation?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	This to you was the only logical conclusion that you could reach?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sort of like two plus two equals four?
2019-11-21	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Chairman. I yield.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, members of the committee. We are here today because Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States, abused the power of his office, the American presidency, for his political and personal benefit. President Trump directed a months-long campaign to solicit foreign help in his 2020 reelection efforts, withholding official acts from the government of Ukraine in order to coerce and secure political assistance and interference in our domestic affairs. As part of this scheme, President Trump applied increasing pressure on the president of Ukraine to publicly announce two investigations helpful to his personal reelection efforts. He applied this pressure himself and through his agents, working within and outside of the US government, by conditioning a desperately sought oval office meeting and $391 million in taxpayer funded, congressionally appropriated security assistance, vital to Ukraine’s ability to fend off Russian aggression. And he conditioned that on the announcement of these two political investigations that were helpful to his personal interests.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	When the president’s efforts were discovered, he released the military aid, though it would ultimately take congressional action for the money to be made fully available to Ukraine. The Oval Office meeting still has not happened. And when faced with the opening of an official impeachment inquiry into his conduct, President Trump launched an unprecedented campaign of obstruction of Congress, ordering executive branch agencies and government officials to defy subpoenas for documents and testimony. To date, the investigating committees have received no documents from the Trump administration pursuant to our subpoenas. Were it not for courageous public servants doing their duty and honoring their oath to this country and coming forward and testifying, the president’s scheme might still be concealed today. The central moment in this scheme was a telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25th of this year. During that call, President Trump asked President Zelensky for a personal favor, to initiate the two investigations that President Trump hoped could ultimately help his reelection in 2020.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The first investigation involved former Vice President Joe Biden, and was an effort to smear his reputation as he seeks the democratic nomination in next year’s presidential election. The second investigation sought to elevate an entirely debunked conspiracy theory, promoted by Russian President Vladimir Putin, that Ukraine interfered in the last presidential election to support the democratic nominee. In truth, as has been made clear by irrefutable evidence from throughout the government, Russia interfered in the last election in order to help then-candidate Trump. The allegations about Vice President Biden and the 2016 election are patently false, but that did not deter president Trump during his phone call with the Ukrainian president and it does not appear to deter him today.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Just two days ago, President Trump stated publicly that he hopes that his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, will report to the Department of Justice and to Congress, the results of Mr. Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine last week, to pursue these false allegations meant to tarnish vice president Biden. President Trump’s persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The overwhelming evidence of this scheme is described in detail in a nearly 300 page document entitled The Trump-Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry Report, formerly transmitted from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to this committee a few days ago. The report relies on testimony from numerous current and former government officials, the vast majority of whom are nonpartisan, career professionals, responsible for keeping our nation safe and promoting American values around the globe. The evidence from these witnesses cannot seriously be disputed. The president placed his personal interests above the nation’s interests in order to help his own reelection efforts. Before I highlight the evidence and the findings of this report, I want to take just a moment to introduce myself and discuss today’s testimony. I joined the house intelligence committee as Senior Advisor and Director of Investigations at the beginning of this year. Previously, I served for 10 years as a prosecutor in the Southern district of New York, when I joined the Department of Justice under the George W. Bush administration. The team that I led on the intelligence community includes other former federal prosecutors, a retired FBI agent, and investigators with significant national security expertise. The report that I am presenting today is based entirely on the evidence that we collected in coordination with the Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees that were gathered as part of the impeachment inquiry into president Trump’s actions. Nothing more and nothing less.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The three investigating committees ran a fair, professional, and thorough investigation. We followed the house rules for depositions and public hearings, including the rule against agency counsel being present for depositions and members and staff from both parties had equal time to ask questions and there were no substantive questions that were prevented from being asked and answered. This investigation moved swiftly and intensively as all good investigation should, to the extent that other witnesses would be able to provide more context and detail about this scheme, their failure to testify is due solely to the fact that President Trump obstructed the inquiry and refused to make them available.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Nevertheless, the extensive evidence that the committee’s uncovered during this investigation led to the following critical findings. First, President Trump used the power of his office to pressure and induce the newly elected president of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 presidential election for president Trump’s personal and political benefit. Second, in order to increase the pressure on Ukraine to announce the politically motivated investigations that President Trump wanted, President Trump withheld a coveted Oval Office meeting and $391 of essential military assistance from Ukraine. Third, President Trump’s conduct sought to undermine our free and fair elections and poses an imminent threat to our national security. And forth, faced with the revelation of his pressure campaign against Ukraine, President Trump directed an unprecedented effort to obstruct Congress’s impeachment inquiry into his conduct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And with that context in mind, I would like to turn to the evidence of President Trump’s conduct concerning Ukraine. My colleague, Mr. Castro, just said that it revolves around eight lines in one call record, but that sorely ignores the vast amount of evidence that we collected, of a months long scheme directed by the president. But I do want to start with that July 25th phone call because that is critical evidence of the president’s involvement and intent. It was on that day that he held his second phone call with the new Ukrainian president. The first in April was short and cordial, following the Ukrainian president’s election success. But this second call would diverge dramatically from what those listening had expected. Now just prior to this telephone call, President Trump spoke to Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, who had donated $1 million to the president’s inaugural campaign and who had been directed by the president himself to take on a leading role in Ukraine issues.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Sondland relayed the president’s message to President Zelensky through Ambassador Kurt Volker, who had had lunch that day with President Zelensky’s top aid, Andriy Yermak, who appears repeatedly through this scheme as President Zelensky’s right hand man. Ambassador Volker texted Mr. Yermak with President Trump’s direction. “Good lunch – thanks. Heard from White House – assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate / ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016 we will nail down for a visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow – Kurt.” So even before the phone call with President Zelensky took place, President Trump had directed that Ukraine initiate the investigation into 2016, the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the election, in order for President Zelensky to get the White House visit that he desperately coveted. Ambassador Sondland was clear in his testimony about this quid pro quo.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	During this call with the Ukrainian leader, President Trump did not discuss matters of import to the United States, such as Ukraine’s efforts to root out corruption. Instead, president Trump veered quickly into the personal favor that he wanted President Zelensky to do. Two investigations that would help President Trump’s reelection effort. Witnesses who listened to the call described it as unusual, improper, inappropriate, and concerning. To of them immediately reported their concerns to White House lawyers. Now, let me just take a few minutes walking through that important call step-by-step, because it is evidence that is central to the president’s scheme. Near the beginning of the call, President Zelensky said, I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically, we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The great support in the area of defense included the nearly $400 million of US military assistance to Ukraine, which one witness testified was nearly 10% of Ukraine’s defense budget. And this support comes as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, when Russia illegally annexed nearly 7% of Ukraine’s territory. Since then, the United States and our allies have provided support for Ukraine, an emerging post-Soviet democracy, to fend off Russia in the East. Yet just a few weeks before this July 25th call, President Trump had inexplicably placed a hold on military assistance to Ukraine without providing any reason to his own cabinet members or national security officials. The evidence the committee’s collected showed that there was unanimous support for the aid from every relevant agency in the Trump administration. Nevertheless, during the call, President Trump complained that US support for Ukraine was not reciprocal, that somehow Ukraine needed to give more to the United States.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did he mean? Well, it became clear, because immediately after President Zelensky brought up us military support and purchasing Javelin anti-tank weapons, President Trump responded, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.” Now, the favor that he referenced there included two demands that had nothing to do with official US policy or foreign policy. First, President Trump said, “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike” As you saw yesterday, excuse me, “I guess you have one of your wealthy people,” it says. “The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people.” And he went on later, “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Here again, president Trump was referring to the baseless conspiracy theory that the Ukrainian government, not Russia, was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Not a single witness in our investigation testified that there was any factual support for this allegation. To the contrary, a unanimous assessment of the US intelligence community found that Russia alone interfered in the 2016 US election. And Special Counsel Mueller, who indicted 12 Russians for this conspiracy, testified before Congress that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion. Dr. Fiona Hill, an expert on Russia and President Putin, who served on the National Security Council until July, testified that the president was told by his own former senior advisors, including his Homeland Security Advisor and his former National Security Advisor, that the alternative theory that Ukraine had interfered in the election was false.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Alternative theory that Ukraine had interfered in the election, was false. And although no one in the US government knew of any factual support for this theory, it did have one significant supporter, Russian President Vladimir Putin. In February of 2017, President Putin said “Second, as we all know, during the presidential campaign in the United States, the Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral position in favor of one candidate. More than that, certain oligarchs certainly with the approval of the political leadership, funded this candidate or female candidate to be more precise.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And if there was ever any doubt about how benefits from this unfounded theory put forward by President Trump and his associates, President Putin made it clear very recently when he said “Than God no one is accusing us anymore of interfering in U.S. elections. Now they’re accusing Ukraine.” In the face of clear evidence, not only from intelligence community experts, but from his own national security team, that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election for the benefit of Donald Trump. President Trump still pressed the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into this conspiracy theory. And why? Because it would help his own political standing.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump even sought to withhold and Oval Office meeting from the President of Ukraine until he fell in line with President Putin’s lies. The leader who had actually invaded Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The second demand that President Trump made of President Zelensky during the July 25th call was to investigate the front runner for the Democratic nomination for President in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. President Trump stated “The other thing. There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Witnesses unanimously testified that there was no factual support for this claim. Rather, they noted that Vice President Biden was acting in support of an international consensus and official U.S. policy to clean up the Prosecutor General’s office in Ukraine. Despite these facts, by the time of the July 25th call, Mr. Giuliani had been publicly advocating for these two investigations for months, while also using back channels to press Ukrainian officials to initiate them in support of his client, Donald Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Sondland understood Mr. Giuliani’s role very clearly. He testified “Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew these investigations were important to the President.” To others, Mr. Giuliani was working at cross purposes with official policy channels toward Ukraine, even as he was working on behalf of President Trump. According to former National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton, Mr. Giuliani was a quote “Hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up” un quote.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Near the end of the July 25th call, President Zelensky circled back to the precooked message that Ambassador Volker had relayed to President Zelensky’s top aide before the call. President Zelensky said “I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also wanted to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and we will work on the investigation.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In other words, on one hand is the White House visit, while on the other hand, he agreed to pursue the investigations. This statement shows the President Zelensky fully understood at the time of the July 25th call, the quid pro quo between these investigations and the White House meeting that President Trump required, and that Ambassador Sondland had testified so clearly about.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Numerous witnesses testified about the importance of a White House meeting with the President of the United States, specifically a meeting in the Oval Office, an official act by President Trump. As David Holmes, Senior Official in the U.S. embassy in Ukraine said “It is important to understand that a White House visit was critical to President Zelensky. President Zelensky need to show U.S. support at the highest levels in order to demonstrate to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he had U.S. backing as well as to advance his ambitious anti-corruption reform agenda at home.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In other words, the White House visit would help Zelensky’s anti-corruption reforms. And that support remains critical as President Zelensky meets today with President Putin to try to resolve the conflict in the East. Now the day after this phone call, President Trump sought to ensure that President Zelensky got the message. On July 26th, U.S. officials met with President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials in Kyiv. And President Zelensky mentioned that President Trump had brought up some quote “Very sensitive issues” un quote.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	After that meeting, Ambassador Sondland had a private, one on one meeting with Andrey Yermak, President Zelensky’s top aide, during which Ambassador Sondland said that they probably discussed the issue of investigations. At lunch right after that with Mr. Holmes and tow other state department officers, Ambassador Sondland pulled out his cell phone and called President Trump. Somewhat shocked, Mr. Holmes recounted the conversation that followed. “I heard Ambassador Sondland greet the President and explain he was calling from Kyiv. I heard President Trump then clarify that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine, and went on to state that President Zelensky, quote “loves your ass.” Un quote. I then heard President ask “So he’s going to do the investigation?” Ambassador Sondland replied that he is gong to do it, adding the President Zelensky will do “anything you ask him to do.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	After the call, Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Holmes that President Trump did not give a bleep about Ukraine and only cares about the big stuff that benefits the President himself, like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. To repeat, and this is very important, Ambassador Sondland spoke to President Trump before the July 25th call with President Zelensky and relayed to Ukrainian officials President Trump’s requirement of political investigations in exchange for a White House meeting.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And during that call, President Trump asked for the favor of these two political investigations immediately after the Ukrainian President brought up U.S. military support for Ukraine, which President Trump had recently suspended or put on hold. And at the end of the call, President Zelensky made a point of acknowledging the link between the investigations that President Trump requested and the White House meeting that President Zelensky desperately wanted.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then the following day, Ambassador Sondland confirmed to President Trump on the telephone in person, that the Ukrainians would indeed initiate the investigations discussed on the call, which was the only thing about Ukraine that President Trump cared about.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, it’s very important to understand that this investigation revealed that the July 25th call was neither the start nor the end of President Trump’s efforts to use the powers of his office for personal political gain. And you have to look at all of the evidence in context, as a whole. Prior to the call, the President had removed the former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, to clear the way for his three handpicked agents to spearhead his corrupt agenda in Ukraine, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker, all of whom attended President Zelensky’s inauguration on May 20th. All political appointees, they proved to be more than willing to engage in what Dr. Hill later described as an “improper domestic political errand for the President.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	On April 21, President Zelensky won the Ukrainian election with 73 percent of the vote. And he had two primary platforms. To resolve the war in the East with Russia and to root out corruption. That same day, President Trump called to congratulate him on his win. Even though the White House press release following the call stated that President Trump expressed his shared commitment to quote “Root out corruption” un quote, President Trump in fact did not mention corruption at all on this call, just like he did not mention corruption on the July 25th call.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Shortly after this call, President Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence to attend President Zelensky’s inauguration. But on May 13, President Trump did an about face and directed Vice President Pence not to attend. An advisor to Vice President Pence testified that the inauguration had not yet been scheduled and therefore the reason for the abrupt change of plans was not related to any scheduling issues.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So what had happened in the three weeks between April 21 and May 13 when Vice President Pence was originally invited and then disinvited or removed from the delegation? A few things. First, on April 25th, Vice President Biden formally announced his bid for the Democratic nomination for President. Then about a week later on May 3, President Trump spoke with President Putin on the telephone. One Senior State Department official testified that the conversation between President Trump and President Putin included a discussion of Ukraine. Third, on May 9th, Mr. Giuliani told the New York Times that he intended to travel to Ukraine on behalf of his client, President Trump, in order to quote “Meddle in an investigation” un quote.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But after public backlash and apparent pushback from the Ukrainians, Mr. Giuliani canceled his trip the next day, claiming the President Zelensky was surrounded by enemies of President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	At a critical May 23 meeting in the Oval Office, President Trump said that Ukraine was corrupt and tried to take him down in 2016. The same false narrative pushed by President Putin and Mr. Giuliani. And in order for the White House meeting to occur, President Trump told the delegation they must talk to Rudy to get the visit scheduled.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	These comments from President Trump were the first of many subsequent indications that in his mind, corruption equals investigations. In the weeks and months following, Mr. Giuliani relayed to both Ukrainian officials and the government officials that President Trump had designated at the May 23 meeting to take a lead on Ukraine policy. The directive from President Trump that a White House meeting would not occur until Ukraine announced the two political investigations that President Trump required. And well before the July 25th call, Ambassador Sondland and Volker also relayed this quid pro quo to the Ukrainians, including to President Zelensky himself.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Volker conveyed the message directly to President Zelensky at the beginning of July, urging him to reference investigations associated with the Giuliani factor with President Trump. And in meetings at the White House on July 10, Ambassador Sondland told other U.S. officials and two of President Zelensky’s advisors, including Mr. Yermak, that he had an agreement with acting Chief of Staff Mich Mulvaney that the White House visit would be scheduled if Ukraine announced the investigations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	One witness testified that during the second of the meetings, Ambassador Sondland began to review what the deliverable would be in order to get the meeting, referring to an investigation of the Bidens. The witness told the committee that the request was explicit. There was no ambiguity. And then Ambassador Sondland also mentioned Burisma, a major Ukrainian energy company that Hunter Biden sat on the board of.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	To the witnesses that testified before the committee, the references to Burisma was shorthand for an investigation into the Bidens. Ambassador Bolton as well as his staff members, objected to this meeting for an investigations trade. And Ambassador Bolton told Dr. Hill “You go and tell Eisenberg, John Eisenberg, the Legal Advisor for the National Security Council. That I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go ahead and tell him what you’ve heard and what I’ve said.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yet this was not a rogue operation by Mr. Giuliani and Ambassador Sondland and Volker. As Ambassador Sondland testified, everyone was in the loop, including Mr. Mulvaney, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry and their top advisors. On July 19th, Ambassador Sondland emailed Mr. Mulvaney, Secretary Perry, Secretary Pompeo and others after speaking with President Zelensky. The subject was “I talked to Zelensky just now.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Ambassador Sondland wrote “He is prepared to receive POTUS’ call.” POTUS is the President of the United States. “We’ll assure him the he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will quote ‘turn over every stone’ un quote.” Both Secretary Perry and Chief of Staff Mulvaney quickly responded to the email, noting that given that conversation, a date would soon be set to schedule the White House telephone call.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The evidence also unambiguously shows that the Ukrainians understood this quid pro quo and had serious reservations, particularly because President Zelensky had won the election on an anti-corruption platform. In fact, a few days before the July 25th call, Ambassador William Taylor, the acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and the former permanent Ambassador to Ukraine, texted Ambassador Sondland and Volker. Or rather, he stated in his testimony “On July 20th, I had a phone conversation with Mr. Danyliuk, during which he conveyed to me that President Zelensky did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection campaign.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But President Trump’s pressure campaign on President Zelensky did not relent. And just four days later, President Zelensky received that message via Kurt Volker, that he needed to convince President Trump that he would do the investigations in order to get that White House meeting. And as I have described, President Zelensky tried to do exactly that on the July 25th call with President …
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He tried to do exactly that on the July 25th call with President Trump. In the weeks following the July 25th call, President Zelensky headed President Trump’s request sending his top aid, Mr. Yermak to Madrid to meet with Mr. Giuliani in coordination with Mr. Giuliani and the President Trump’s handpicked representatives. They continued this pressure campaign to secure a public announcement of the investigations. Now, according to Ambassador Sondland, and this is very important, President Trump did not require that Ukraine actually conduct the investigations as a prerequisite for the White House meeting. Instead, the Ukrainian government needed only to publicly announce the investigations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It is clear that the goal was not the investigations themselves or not any corruption that those investigations might’ve entailed, but the political benefit that President Trump would enjoy from an announcement of investigations into his 2020 political rival and against a unanimous assessment that showed that he received foreign support in the 2016 election. For that reason, the facts didn’t actually matter to President Trump because he only cared about the personal and political benefit from the announcement of the investigation. Over the next couple of weeks, Ambassador Sondland and Volcker worked with President Trump’s aid, Mr Yermak to draft a statement for President Zelensky to issue.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	When the aid proposed a statement that did not include specific references to the investigations that President Trump wanted, the Burisma and Biden investigation and the 2016 election investigation, Mr Giuliani relayed that that would not be good enough to get a White House meeting. And here you can see a comparison on the left of the original statement drafted by Mr. Yermak, the top aid to President Zelensky, and on the right, a revised statement with Mr. Giuliani’s requirements. It says we intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, and here’s the critical difference, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 US elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The only difference in the statement that Giuliani required and the statement that the Ukrainians had drafted was this reference to the two investigations that President Trump wanted and told President Zelensky about on the July 25th call. Now, ultimately, President Zelensky’s administration temporarily shelved this announcement though efforts to press Ukraine would remain ongoing. By mid August, Ukraine did not make a public announcement of the investigations that President Trump required, and as a result, no White House meeting was scheduled. But by this time the president was pushing on another pressure point to coerce Ukraine to announce the investigations, the hold on the vital military assistance that the president had put in place for more than a month and still without any explanation to any of the policy experts.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Our investigation revealed that a number of Ukrainian officials had made quiet inquiries to various US officials about the aid as early as July 25th the day of the phone call. Inquiries by Ukrainian officials continued in the weeks that followed until the hold was revealed at the end of August. But this is important. It was important for the Ukrainian officials to keep it quiet because if it became public, then Russia would know that the US support for Ukraine might be on ice. So by the end of that month, the evidence revealed several facts. One, the president demanded that Ukraine publicly announced two politically motivated investigations to benefit his reelection. Two, A coveted white house meeting was expressly conditioned on Ukraine announcing those investigations. Three, President Trump had placed a hold on vital military assistance to Ukraine without any explanation and not withstanding the uniform support for that assistance from the relevant federal agencies and Congress.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Taylor testified that this quid pro quo between the investigations President Trump wanted and the security assistance that President Trump needed was crazy. And he told Ambassador Sondland, “As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.” Now, in an effort to move the White House meeting and the military aid along, Ambassador Sondland wrote an email to Secretary Pompeo on August 22nd. He wrote, “Mike, should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place, parentheses, mid September, Ze, President Zelensky should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to POTUS and to the US. Hopefully that will break the logjam. Ambassador Sondland testified that this was a reference to the political investigations that President Trump discussed on the July 25th call, which Secretary Pompeo ultimately admitted to that he listened to in real time.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Sondland hoped that this would help lift the logjam, which he meant the hold on critical security assistance to Ukraine and the White House meeting. And what was Secretary Pompeo’s response three minutes later, “Yes.” After the hold on, military assistance became public on August 28th, senior Ukrainian officials expressed grave concern, deeply worried of course about the practical impact on their efforts to fight Russian aggression, but also, and this goes back to why it remained confidential, also about the public message that it sent to the Russian government. On September 1st at a pre-briefing with Vice President Pence before he met with President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland raised the issue of the hold on security assistance. He said, “I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Vice President Pence simply nodded in response expressing neither surprise nor dismay at the linkage between the two. And following Vice President Pence’s meeting with President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland went over to Mr. Yermak again, President Zelensky’s top aide and pulled him aside to explain that the hold on security assistance was also now conditioned on the public announcement of the Burisma, Biden, and the 2016 election interference investigations. Ambassador Sondland then explained to Ambassador Taylor that he had previously made a mistake in telling Ukrainian officials that only the White House meeting was conditioned on a public announcement of the political investigations beneficial to President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In truth, everything, the White House meeting and the vital security assistance to Ukraine was now conditioned on the public announcement. President Trump wanted President Zelensky in a public box, a private commitment was not good enough. Nearly one week later on September 7th, the hold remained and President Trump and Ambassador Sondland spoke on the phone. The president immediately told Ambassador Sondland that there was no quid pro quo, but, and this is very important, President Zelensky would still be required to announce the investigations in order for the hold on security assistance to be lifted, and he should want to do it.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In effect, this is the equivalent of saying there is no quid pro quo, no this for that, before then demanding precisely that quid pro quo. And immediately after this phone call with President Trump, this was the precise message that Ambassador Sondland passed directly to President Zelensky. According to Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Sondland also said that he had talked to Presidents Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and had told them that although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. And I understood a stalemate to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much needed military assistance.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Needing the military assistance and hoping for the White House meeting, President Zelensky finally relented to President Trump’s pressure campaign and arrangements were soon made for the Ukrainian president to make a statement during an interview on CNN where he would make a public announcement of the two investigations that President Trump wanted in order for President Zelensky to secure the White House meeting and for Ukraine to get that much needed military assistance. And although there is no doubt that President Trump had ordered the military aid held up until the Ukrainians committed to the investigations, on October 17th acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney confirmed in public that there was such a quid pro quo. Let’s watch what he said.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	There you have it. By early September, the president’s scheme was unraveling. On September 9th, the intelligence oversight and foreign affairs committees announced an investigation into President Trump and Mr. Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine. And later that same day, the intelligence committee learned that a whistleblower had filed a complaint nearly a month earlier related to some unknown issue, but which the president and the White House knew was related to Ukraine and had been circulating among them for some time. And then two days later on September 11th in the face of growing public and congressional scrutiny, President Trump lifted the hold on security assistance to Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	As with the implementation of the hold, no reason was provided. Put simply, President Trump got caught, so he released the aid. But even since this investigation began, the president has demonstrated no contrition or acknowledgement that his demand for a foreign country to interfere in our election is wrong. In fact, he has repeatedly called on Ukraine to investigate Vice President Biden, his rival. These and other actions by the president and his associates demonstrate that his determination to solicit foreign interference in our election continues today. It did not end with Russia’s support for Trump in 2016, which President Trump invited by asking for his opponent to be hacked by Russia. And it did not end when his Ukrainian scheme was exposed in September of this year.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump also engaged once this investigation began in an unprecedented effort to obstruct the inquiry, and I look forward to answering your questions about that unprecedented obstruction. But in conclusion, I want to say that the intelligence committee has produced to you a nearly 300-page report, and I am grateful that you have offered me the opportunity today to walk you through some of the evidence underlying it. Admittedly, it is a lot to digest, but let me just say this. The president’s scheme is actually quite simple and the facts are not seriously in dispute. It can be boiled down to four key takeaways. First that President Trump directed a scheme to pressure Ukraine into opening two investigations that would benefit his 2020 reelection campaign and not the US national interest.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Second, President Trump used his official office and the official tools of US foreign policy, the withholding of an oval office meeting and $391 million in security assistance to pressure Ukraine into meeting his demands. Third, everyone was in the loop, his chief of staff, the secretary of state, and vice president. And forth, despite the public discovery of this scheme, which prompted the president to release the aid, he has not given up. He and his agents continue to solicit Ukrainian interference in our election causing an imminent threat to our elections and our national security.  Part 1
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, it did.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, in several ways.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, right from the outset.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, it did, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t think there’s any other way to read the words on the page than to conclude that.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yeah, in my experience as 10 years as a prosecutor, you almost never have a defendant or someone who’s engaging in misconduct who would ever explicitly say, in this case, President Zelensky, I’m going to bribe you now. Or I’m going to ask for a bribe. Or I am now going to extort you. That’s not the way these things work.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, it was about these two specific investigations that President Trump ultimately did discuss and ask President Zelensky to do. These are the same two investigations that were discussed and were the only two investigations that were at issue throughout the entirety of the scheme. And so what our evidence found was that any time that there was a reference to investigations, it referenced the Biden investigation and the 2016 election investigation. And, in fact, Ambassador Volker actually said that whenever he was using the term corruption, what he meant was those specific two investigations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	When Dr. Hill left and Tim Morrison replaced her, they had transition meetings and during one of those transition meetings, Dr. Hill told Tim Morrison about what she believed to be this irregular channel that Ambassador Sondland was operating where they were pushing for Ukraine to do these investigations. And Dr. Hill, in particular, was very concerned because as she said, as you pointed out, that was a domestic political errand and what she was working on and the National Security Council was working on related to national security and foreign policy and those were two entirely separate things.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	At the time that she said that to Tim Morrison, she was not aware of whether President Trump had actually endorsed these investigations but she did testify that after she read the call transcript, which she only read after it was released, like the rest of us, she said that she put two and two together and realized that that is exactly what he was talking about.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It equals four.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, it was used by two witnesses, Ambassador Sondland and David Holmes as the only logical conclusion to explain why the security assistance was being withheld from Ukraine. And based on all of the various factors and their direct involvement in issues related to Ukraine, they concluded that the security assistance was being withheld to put pressure and as a condition on the initiation of the two investigations that are referenced here.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. The witnesses testified that that is a consistent and persistent policy objective for the United States.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, he did not.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, he did not.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Castor… No, you can’t. Mr. Castor let me ask you a question.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I think it goes actually even a little further. I think, whether the Attorney General wanted anything to do or not is in addition to the fact that the Attorney General said he had nothing to do with Ukraine and, in fact, that there were no ongoing investigations at the time of this call or in August. And that became an issue in the investigation.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	There is a formal channel that the Department of Justice has and the United States government has to obtain evidence related to an ongoing investigation and that is generally the proper way to engage a foreign country through treaties to get information. But several of the witnesses testified that they looked into that at the urging of the Ukrainians and they determined that there was no formal ongoing investigation, nor any formal request on these topics.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Giuliani was very active and involved in pushing for these investigations for several months before the July 25th call and then for several months after, including, apparently, three days ago.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s a personal political issue. If you don’t mind, I’ll just take a moment to respond to Mr. Caster because-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	On that July 19th meeting between ambassador Volker and Rudy Giuliani, ambassador Volker told Mr. Giuliani that the allegations about Joe Biden were completely bogus and wrong. And, Mr. Giuliani actually told, according to ambassador Volker’s testimony, Mr. Giuliani said that he knew that. And, yet, for the next two months he continued to push for that same investigation at the direction of president Trump. Who had also directed presidents Zelensky to contact Mr. Giuliani. So, that July 19th meeting that Mr. Caster brought up is actually quite important to this investigation.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I agree with Mr. Caster. I think that’s what the evidence shows. That at that May 23rd meeting, president Trump directed and delegated authority over Ukraine matters to ambassador Sondland, Volker, and secretary Perry, and told them to work with Rudy. And, then, over the next three months, that’s exactly what happened. At the president’s direction.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. They quickly realized it, I think, from their own internal conversations. Because, Mr. Giuliani had back channels to getting to the Ukrainian officials. And, ambassador Volker told to the Ukrainians as well that there was this, quote, Giuliani factor that presidents Zelensky… he actually told it to president Zelensky, that there was this Giuliani factor that they needed to deal with with the president.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t mean to be a stickler, but I believe this text was actually July 10th. And, this was a critical text because what it is saying is Mr. Yermak, after having spoken to Mr. Volker a week before and learning about the importance of Giuliani, requested to ambassador Volker to meet… to set up a meeting with Mr. Giuliani. That, then, proceeded to this July 19th breakfast that Mr. Caster said. And, then, a July 22nd phone call. And, then, ultimately they met in Madrid on August 2nd.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Certainly.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. It was the unanimous view of all of the agencies, secretary of state, department of state, department of defense, national security council, literally every one of the inner agencies that believed that the aid was vital and had already been approved and should be released immediately.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Sondland ultimately conveyed that the release of the aid was conditioned on the public announcement of the investigations. And, if we could put up slide 26 from the affidavit-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, if I may just in response to this-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sure.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. He said that at a meeting on September 1st with Mr. Yermak In Warsaw.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. Ambassador Sondland testified to that. And, ambassador Volker also testified to that.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, every single witness said, after reading the phone call on July 25th, that it was clear Burisma equaled Biden, that they were one-in-the-same. There were only two witnesses who said that they did not know that until that time. And, there was ample testimony… there was a lot of testimony from people involved in all aspects of Ukraine policy, who indicated that it was completely unrealistic and unlikely that anyone who had anything to do with Ukraine would not know that the Burisma investigation related to the Bidens.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	They said that in July. And, in August, ultimately, they didn’t give the statement in large part because they had reservations given the president Zelensky was an anti-corruption reformer. They had reservations about engaging in US domestic politics. That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, I think president Trump had every reason to try to put out that message at that point. As ambassador Sondland said, even when he… even if you credit ambassador Sondland’s version of the testimony, which, is contradicted by other witnesses who took contemporaneous notes. And, were far more credible than Mr. Sondland, who had to amend his testimony a couple times. He said, even in that comment, he said, no quid pro quo out of the blue without risk… without any question about whether or not there was a quid pro quo.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s true.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I do.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I do.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The 2000-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Are you talking about in 2015?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He did. George Kent testified that that was-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But, it’s important context.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He did it pursuant to US official policy.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Oh, it’s nearly a 300 page report. I can’t possibly count.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I have no idea.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Are you talking about the report or his deposition?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, and over time he remembered a lot more as he was refreshed by other people’s testimony.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Certainly.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I’m not… certainly over a dozen, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Most of the subpoenas were not publicly-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sir, I’m trying to answer the question.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did what? Come out.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. They were given to the minority, but not the public. Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t… I’m not sure. I don’t think so.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But, I’m not sure.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, we issued a number of subpoenas for records. We did issue six subpoenas to executive branch agencies, and, they all defied our subpoenas.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We are-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, we are. Because, there are multiple numbers. We only issued subpoenas for call records for people who were involved in the investigation and who had already been subpoenaed by the committee for documents and testimony of their own.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, I am trying to answer your question, sir.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t know off the top of my-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t know. If you’d like me to find out during the break, I’d be happy to.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We subpoenaed for call records. Multiple numbers.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t know. None of-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	This is very important though. None of members of Congress. None of staff of Congress.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	None of journalists. We only did it to the subjects who were involved in the investigation. Which, is a very routine and standard investigative practice, sir.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t think that’s how we did it, sir.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t think anyone did, sir.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s actually… what you just described is exactly how it happens.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	If I could just explain, sir. You pick an event of significance in the investigation and you look for sequencing and patterns surrounding that event. You look then at the numbers and you try to identify what those numbers are. And, then, you start to build the circumstantial case.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I know I’m under oath, sir. It doesn’t matter.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And, I will answer the question if you’ll give me a second here. It’s not a simple answer.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, I think he was allowed to answer the question.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s not a leak, sir.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, I’m not going to get into the deliberations of our investigation with you. And, I will tell you the reason it was included in the report is because the calls were a surrounding important evidence to our investigation. And, I think that your question is, frankly, not better directed… not at me, but at the people who were having conversations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The people involved in the president’s scheme.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s not true.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I am going to go on record and tell you that I’m not going to reveal how we conducted this investigation.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I can tell you what the importance is-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Can I respond? Are you, are you trying to say that I… what are you trying to say? What is the implication here? But, by the way, I didn’t give anything close to a million dollars, remotely.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, I would like to just say one other thing.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I mean, you’re casting aspersions about me, personally.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Chairman Adler, could I just respond quickly on the phone records only because it’s now come up?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The favor was to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory related to Ukraine interference in the 2016 election and then later …
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The talking points certainly were the part of the official US policy and they included anti-corruption efforts and national security efforts. Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is correct. It’s a routine process that the National Security Council does, but the president generally is able to use them or not use them. Witnesses said that the president is not required to use them. What was so startling here is that he not only veered off …
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	… From them, but that he went to his own personal interests.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, generally.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, it was not before and it was not after this call.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I’m sorry, can you repeat the question?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Every single witness said there’s no factual basis for either of the investigations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, that’s what the evidence showed.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No evidence of that.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. Well, listen to that call.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	They did it for separate reasons. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was concerned about the substance of the call that it was improper. Mr. Morrison was concerned about the potential political ramifications if the call was released because of the substance of the call and the political nature of the call.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And he was not the only witness to express that concern.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. So as you probably know, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is a purple heart award winner or medal winner from Iraq and he has been in the department of defense for 20 years and has a great sense of duty and a great patriotism to this country and felt that he compelled to follow that sense of duty and report it.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. There’s a distinction between doing an official act for an official purpose and doing an official act for a personal purpose. And if I could just respond to something Mr. Castor said. When he said that there were problems because the Zlochevsky paid a bribe to the head of Burisma in order to get out from under the prosecution, that was exactly the type of conduct that Vice President Biden wanted to shut down in Ukraine. That was exactly the type of non anti-corruption policies that Vice President Biden was objecting to using the official policy.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So that’s one of the reasons that he, I mean I don’t know if that was one, but that’s the type of thing that he based, he and the Americans and the Europeans based their decision on.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Chairman, if I could just clarify, treason is not in our report. I just want to.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	All the time. Conspiracies have different layers and the top layers make the bottom layers do the work so that they’re further removed from the actual conduct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, Mr. Giuliani said that, President Trump said that to a number of other individuals and then those individuals, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker also said that.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And if it’s not official foreign policy, it would be helpful to President Trump’s personal interest.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And even the Ukrainians realized that.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It does. And clearly it continued long after our investigation began.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s what all the witnesses said.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Giuliani? Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, who was also involved in this thing.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, who was talking to people involved at the time.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	They decided to work with Mr. Giuliani.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. That was the second time that he invited him to the White House.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And if I could just take a second to correct what Mr. Castor said about that meeting, there really is no inconsistent statements about whether or not Ambassador Sondland raised the issue of investigations in connection to the White House. Even Ambassador Volker, in his public testimony, was forced to admit that he did hear that, and he said it was inappropriate.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And address any specific personnel issues.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And that text message was actually a direction, a message relayed from President Trump himself.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. Including too Secretary Pompeo as well.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I will answer that question in a minute, but I would like just to comment to Mr. Buck that the majority staff, and no one had any contact with Ambassador Sondland after his deposition. But the answer to your question is yes, Ms. Bess.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, he’s never come to the White House. And several witnesses, multiple witnesses, said that there’s a huge distinction between a White House meeting, and a meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, where they did meet on September 25th.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, the evidence found that the White House meeting was conditioned on the announcement of these investigations. And so once in mid-August when the Ukrainians, Mr. Yermak and President Zelensky, decided that they were not going to issue that statement, that Rudy Giuliani wanted to include Burisma and the 2016 elections, there was no White House meeting. It soon became clear to them that the security assistance was also at risk and that took on a renewed importance for them.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And the report say that they worked closely, and then there were also phone calls with the White House around the same time, that they were working closely.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, the key difference is that it had to include that the Ukraine would do the investigations of Burisma, which equaled the Biden investigation, and the 2016 Ukraine interference.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Sondland very clearly testified that all he ever heard Mr. Giuliani, or anyone, say is that they only needed the public announcement of the investigations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The evidence showed that Mr. Giuliani not only played a role, but that he was essentially the President’s agent. He was acting on behalf of the President, expressing the President’s wishes, desires.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, Ambassador Sondland produced for his public testimony, and I think it’s very important, in light of the testimony from Mr. Castor a minute ago with Mr. Buck, as to how many times that Mr. Sondland did not remember in his deposition, because we agree it was egregious. But the advantage of doing closed depositions is that Mr. Sondland Could not match up his testimony. So as other witnesses came in, then he realized that he had to actually admit to more and more stuff. So he did admit to an email that included secretary Pompeo, Mulvaney.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right after President Zelensky thanks President Trump for the military assistance, then President Trump asks for a favor. And of course by this point, President Trump had already placed the hold on the security assistance.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No. There was significant evidence that even as early as July 25th, at the time of this call, that Ukrainian officials had suspected that the aid was being withheld. And there was a New York Times article, actually last week, that wasn’t included in our report, but from the former Deputy Foreign Minister, who said that Ukraine, President Zelensky’s office, received a diplomatic cable from the embassy here the week of July 25th saying that the aid had been held.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, that’s what I was referring to.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So it’s a good question because Mr. Sandy did say that, but notably Mr. Sandy said that he only heard that in early September. That reason was never provided to him, or anybody else, before early September, for the first two months of the hold. And of course it was given at that point as this, the gig was up so to speak.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It was, he wasn’t sure of the timing, but he was ultimately told that the reason for the hold, after it was lifted, was for that reason. But that’s I think an after the fact excuse based on our evidence, because no other witnesses were ever told of that reason during the entire time that it was held.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Sondland said those were the two investigations that president Trump mentioned on the July 25th call, which secretary Pompeo who received that email listened into.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	At the time of that email, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, and it was signed by president Trump into law.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Absolutely.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is true and the readout from the white house after the call did say that president Trump talked about corruption.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, and if I could just take a second to talk about that, because that’s very important. This goes back to what Mr. Collins was talking about with vice president Biden. There is absolutely conditionality on aid in routinely in all sorts of different ways, but it’s done through official policy and these anticorruption benchmarks that you’re referencing here was a condition of Ukraine getting the aid. But in May, the Department of Defense in conjunction with the other inner agencies certified that Ukraine was making the necessary progress on anti-corruption efforts to merit the aid.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The aid was subsequently held. It was supposed to be released, DOD announced the release and then President Trump held the aid without explanation.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No. The evidence really supports the fact that president Trump views corruption in Ukraine to be synonymous with the two investigations that he wants.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He told ambassador Sondland himself that that is the only thing that he cares about.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is the only logical explanation as multiple witnesses said.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, and that was subsequently confirmed in a conversation with president Trump himself.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yeah. That was the pretty much unanimous view of all 17 witnesses that came in to testify in before the intelligence committee.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. The scheme part is very important, because the minority wants to focus on these four very narrow facts that ignore the vast majority of the evidence. So the fact that he use scheme is actually critical to the whole case here.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I’m here to present the report that we did on our investigation, which was totally and completely reliant on the actual evidence that we uncovered the witness testimony and the documents.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I’m not a partisan.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	For the house? Since earlier this year.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I do, sir. I think it’s very important for-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It’s all right. I think it’s very important to support candidates for office, I think our [crosstalk 01:15:07]-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Do you mind if-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You don’t care about?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t know the number, but-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I don’t know and I don’t see the relevance.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Gaetz, I’m here to talk about this report.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I’m happy to talk to you about the report.`
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I have made a number of tweets in my private capacity before I came to this job when I was working in the media. Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sir, I would be happy to put this investigation up with any of the nonpartisan investigator, I did during-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	… my 10 years as a federal prosecutor.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I hope you read the evidence and I think you can judge for yourself-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	… whether it’s partisan or not.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The witnesses were quite clear about this and they say it mattered for multiple reasons. The first is that Russia invaded Ukraine to take over part of their country. This was the first military incursion in Europe since World War II. And this is Russia, who’s an adversary actually trying to encroach on another democracy. So just from a broad democratic viewpoint, it was essential not only to Ukraine’s national security, but to America’s national security to make sure that democracy remains worldwide.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Congress had approved the aid and then the president had helped the aid.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He announce the release of the aid, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Everyone agreed it was against our national security interest to do so. The only explanation that any witness provided was Mr. Sandy who said that he had heard from Rob Blair, I believe, the assistant to Mick Mulvaney, that the reason was because of other countries’ donations or contributions to Ukraine, but that was only in September and of course there were no further commitments from any other country.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It would be a wonderful problem to have.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Zero.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The witnesses said that that would help Russia.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	After ambassador Volker suggested to Mr. Yermak again, who’s here that they should not investigate the prior president of Ukraine. Mr Yermak said back to him, “Oh, you’re encouraging us to investigate Bidens and Clintons.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump and the White House.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	President Trump is the central player in this scheme.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	They were about to release it, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, he did not.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s what pretty much every witness said.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is what we found.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, there were 17.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Morrison and Vindman went to the lawyers as soon as they learned of it. Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Dr. Fiona Hill was the senior director for the Europe and Russia directorate at the National Security Council until July of this year.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I think her family actually came from England. It was Marie Yovanovitch who had-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He was concerned that Ambassador Sondland and Mick Mulvaney were entering into essentially a transaction whereby the Ukrainians would open up these investigations for President Trump’s political interests in return for getting the White House meeting that President Trump had offered.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	There were several. There was a conversation at the end of June where several American officials had indicated to President Zelensky that he needed to go forward with these investigations. There was one on August 16th I recall that he talked about. But you bring up a very important point, which is all of the State Department witnesses in particular, and frankly, almost all of the witnesses other than Ambassador Sondland, took unbelievable meticulous notes. I would have dreamed for a witness like that as a prosecutor. And it makes for a very clear and compelling record and clear and compelling evidence that’s based on contemporaneous notes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We have no State Department records including these memos to file, the notes, Ambassador Taylor’s first-person cable and emails. There are so many documents that the few that we have gotten have been so helpful to the investigation.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The State Department refused to provide them, not withstanding our subpoena, under the President’s direction.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is correct. There was no witness testified that there was any review or any investigation of any sort related to the Ukraine aid.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And everyone involved in Ukraine policy believed that they were on the right path. And President Zelensky in particular.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Both the anti-corruption agenda and fighting the aggression from Russia.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Joe Biden started running for president.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I would add, the Mueller report came out, which did not, even though it did not charge the President and implicated the President and his campaign in welcoming the assistance from Russia and utilizing it.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Sondland said the President does not give a bleep about Ukraine. He only cares about the big stuff, meaning the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. And by the way, just to add that as a direct evidence conversation between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland on that day. And there are many that we have not talked about on the minority side.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Not only were they made aware, but they were made aware either by President Trump’s proxy, Rudy Giuliani, or form President Trump himself through Ambassador Sondland, who spoke to President Zelensky and Andrey Yermak on September 7th and told them what President Trump had confirmed to him, that the aid was conditioned on the investigations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. Finally, President Zelensky relented after months of trying to not get involved in what he called the domestic US political process, and ultimately recognizing that he had no choice to break the stalemate, as Ambassador Sondland told them, that he ultimately agreed to go on television before President Trump got caught and released the aid.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I’m sorry, by what date?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. Well, widely reported, certainly the aid being withheld was widely reported.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Two days after the investigations were announced and two days after the IG, the Inspector General, told the Intelligence Committee that there was a complaint that was being withheld.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. And I would just add one thing briefly to the Congressman’s point, that it is true that President Trump has given more military assistance than President Obama. And so one would wonder if he does support military assistance so much, why then is he holding it up for more than two months?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That was the testimony, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, we received testimony from three witnesses about it and it gets a little complicated, but that was a consistent refrain through all of the witnesses is that the President did say, “No quid pro quo.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s correct, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	They did.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	They were not produced to us, but the witnesses said they relied on their notes to provide their testimony.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. Ambassador Sondland also said that too, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, it was quite odd that the President would volunteer in response to nothing about a quid pro quo that there was no quid pro quo.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	[crosstalk 02:16:31] But I think-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, I was just going to say, what’s even more important is that what he said immediately after that, which is effectively conduct that amounts to a quid pro quo. He said, “There’s no quid pro quo, but you have to go the microphone and make this announcement.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. We had a number of different accounts of this, and I think this is-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right, I see that, yes. Ambassador Taylor said that, Ambassador… or Mr. Morrison said something similar. Their understandings of that conversation is that there was a clear directive that there was a quid pro quo factually, from the conduct, from the actions, and we’ve talked a lot today about the words and that Zelensky said, “No pressure,” and Trump said, “No pressure and no quid pro quo,” but as an investigator, as a prosecutor, you need to look at the actions to understand what those words mean and that’s why this call in particular is so important.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Morrison said that he was shocked, I think, and that he-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sinking feeling, correct. And that he went and then talked to the lawyers at the direction of Ambassador Bolton.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That was what Ambassador Taylor testified to, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, Ambassador Sondland’s subsequent public testimony revealed at least two things that were precisely false, that were not true in that text message, including that there was no quid pro quo of any kind when he testified, and we saw the video earlier that there absolutely, assuredly was as it related to the White House meeting.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And it also, this text occurred after Ambassador Sondland relayed President Trump’s message to President Zelensky.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We received a lot of evidence and all of the evidence points to the fact that there was a quid pro quo.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He said because the power disparity between the United States as the greatest power in the world and Ukraine which is so dependent on the United States, not just for the military assistance, but for all of its support, made such a request effectively a demand because President Zelensky could not in reality say no.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And not only does the US provide 10% of their military budget, but the United States is a critical ally in rallying other countries to support Ukraine. Europe actually gives four or five… The European Union gives I think four times as much money as the United States overall to Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. Yes. Even after the aid was released.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That sounds right, if you’re reading the quote. Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We did, and we found that the statements of what is effectively an extortion victim are not particularly relevant to the actual truth of the matter, because President Zelensky cannot in reality for the same reasons that he interpreted the request to be a demand, he can’t go out and say that he did feel pressure, because that would potentially upset President Trump and they’re so dependent on the relationship with President Trump and the United States.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It is certainly a… Duress would be a good word.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. And David Holmes testified I think very persuasively about the importance of the White House meeting and of the relationship to Ukraine, even after the aid was lifted, including pointing to today, when President Putin and President Zelensky met to discuss the war in the East.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, and what’s really important here, and I think it has to be clarified, is that the President, the evidence showed that the President directly said to Ambassador Sondland that there was a quid pro quo with the security assistance and there’s been some debate and some discussion about that, but that is one thing that the evidence shows based on the Morrison testimony, the Taylor testimony, the Sondland testimony and the texts. So that’s very important to understand that whatever we want to say about hearsay or whatever, that is direct evidence.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No. There’s a lot of direct evidence, and a lot of the evidence that they say is hearsay is actually not hearsay.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, technically. Well, not technically, but yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. That is.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And if I could just jump in here on the July 25th call, because these four facts that we keep hearing about that are not in dispute are, three of them are completely wrong. So one of them happens to be that there’s no quid pro quo mentioned in the July 25th call. There is absolutely a quid pro quo when President Zelensky says, “I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington, DC, and then he says, “On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation.” That is the quid pro quo that President Zelensky was informed of before the call. So that’s wrong. It’s also wrong that no Ukrainians knew about the aid being withheld at the time of the call, even though that doesn’t even matter.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then finally, there was no White House meeting ever provided, so the third or fourth fact, so I do think that that just needs to be clarified, particularly as we’re focusing on what direct evidence is.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, although I would say, the call record is better evidence than their…
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is direct evidence.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, it is.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, there’s a lot of evidence that I would call direct evidence because it’s not hearsay. If any of the people involved in the scheme are talking to each other, and they relay what someone else said, that is not hearsay. That would be in court a co-conspirator statement, and that would be admissible. So let’s not get too far afield on talking about direct evidence.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I understand, but it is very important because anything Mr. Giuliani says, anything Ambassador Sondland says, anything any of these people say is not hearsay, and would be permitted under the federal rules of evidence. Of course, we don’t follow the federal rules of evidence here. It’s even more lenient, but that’s an important point.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Courts tell juries to draw inferences every single day in every single courtroom. That is how you determine what the evidence shows. So when Ambassador Sondland draws inferences from the fact that there is no explanation for the aid, the fact that the White House meeting has already been held up because of the investigations, and determines that that’s the reason why the security assistance is also held up, that is a natural, logical inference that every jury draws across the country.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s right. I don’t even think that the minority is alleging that the Ukrainian government systematically in any meaningful way interfered. I think this is just based on a couple of news articles.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. I saw that interview.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is absolutely correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is correct. We had evidence of that, and I think that it’s very important to emphasize what is evidence and what is pure media reports or speculation, because there is no evidence in our investigation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I do. I also recall her testifying that in addition to the Ukrainian officials who made a couple of disparaging comments about President Trump, there are officials from countries all around the world who also made disparaging comments about President Trump. And as Dr. Hill said, their military assistance was not put on hold.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The intelligence community definitely agrees with one and two. Dr. Hill testified to three, as well as there’s a public statement from Mr. Putin, and, yes, certainly the witnesses emphasized four, that Russia benefits from this. And we saw in my opening statement President Putin’s comment that it’s good now that Ukraine is all the talk.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sorry, say that again?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I think the whistleblower’s concerns about President Trump are from the threats that [crosstalk 02:46:30]-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	As I said earlier in response to questions from your colleagues, I’m not going to get into any-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The whistleblower is not relevant to this report and-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He’s not relied upon. The whistleblower’s complaints for the reasons that Mr. Castor said are not included. His allegations are not included in our report because the evidence has been outstripped and surpassed by the 17 witnesses that we have had come in to testify directly about the conduct that the whistleblower blew the whistle about.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sir, I’m not going to talk to you about the identity of the whistleblower.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, that’s what the intelligence-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Sir, in the intelligence committee-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The intelligence committee-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Congress has a right to obtain the anonymity of the-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, there is a little bit more to it, but that’s the gist of it, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He did his duty by testifying, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is right, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. In the July 25th call, that’s when President Trump said that.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	During the testimony? Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, and all the documents.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The minority was given equal time to the majority for every single interview, deposition, or hearing that we did.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, and they did they, and they got three witnesses. They were also allowed to call their own witnesses for the depositions. They chose not to do that. The only witness they requested for the deposition was Chairman Schiff, who is not a fact witness to this investigation.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The best investigative practice when you’re doing a fact finding mission is to keep the information closed, and the reason is exactly what I described earlier with Ambassador Sondland, who, first of all, the day before his deposition, he spoke with Secretary Perry about his testimony. That is the type of tailoring that can happen when people are engaged in misconduct, and they try to line up their stories. So if you keep the information closed, they can’t line up their stories.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I think, frankly, part of the reason why Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sondland’s public hearing testimony was so different from their deposition testimony is because the initial depositions were in closed session before we then released all the transcripts to the public.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s correct. Nor is it unprecedented in Congress. This is actually a rule in the House rules that was passed by Republican congresses. It was used in Benghazi. It was used by a number of committees for the past decade or so.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is right. In the Judiciary Committee, he’s had all of the options. Our inquiry was not the Judiciary Committee’s investigation. That is where the President’s ability to present evidence. Of course, if the President wanted to present evidence in the Intelligence Committee, he could have provided documents, he could have provided the witnesses that we asked for him, but he obstructed rather than cooperate.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s my understanding, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Twice thus far, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Not a single document.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is also true.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes. And if I could just add, this would-
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	This would ordinarily be a document case. If you were prosecuting this case, you’d be basing it on the documents. So the fact that those documents are being withheld is quite significant, and it’s quite remarkable that we built the record we have on the witnesses.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That’s correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right, between testimony and documents, that’s correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	For some of them, that’s correct.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, I am.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is correct. It is unprecedented.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No. It became clear that the President was trying to block everything and block everyone, and eventually they came up with an alternative reason to write an opinion to prevent people from coming, which is quite an aggressive view that they took, but it was quite clear that they were trying to block every single witness.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We thought about it a lot because obviously there are additional witnesses, and we want this to be as thorough an investigation, but as you can see from the Deutsche Bank case or the McGahn case, it takes months and months to go through the appeals court, and that’s effectively what the President wants is just to delay this as long as possible until the next election.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It’s quite possible that it could be several more months, and then there may be the Supreme Court.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Depends on whether it’s this term or it gets pushed over to the next term, but, yes.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Absolutely. And there’s an ongoing threat because the President is trying to cheat to win the next election. It’s not something that happened in the past. It’s continuing in the future, so we cannot delay and just wait for the courts to resolve this when the reason why we would have to go to the courts is because the President is obstructing an investigation into himself.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is a critical component to it.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What Special Counsel Mueller said is that President Trump did invite them and solicit them to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails. Ultimately, the Trump campaign, I think it was welcomed… knew about the interference, welcomed it and utilized it.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, he doesn’t. As I said, it became quite clear in all of his comments and all of the other witnesses that any mention of corruption or anticorruption was really meant, and the evidence showed this, was really a euphemism for the investigations.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He could. I mean at this point he has shown not only a willingness to do it multiple times, but I think more importantly for all of the members’ consideration, he’s also shown a lack of contrition, a lack of acknowledgement that what he is doing is wrong and that it is wrong. And if you don’t recognize that it is wrong, then there is no reason why you won’t do it again if you’ve already done it.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes, for the same reasons that we just discussed. I mean, and I think the June television interview with George Stephanopoulos this year where the president indicated that he would, once again, welcome for an interference is another data point to understand where it is. And I would just say to Mr. Reschenthaler, who was saying that he’s got such a great record and that the Democrats just don’t want him to win. The question is, if that is the case and that very well may be the case, then why does he need to cheat to win the election? Why can’t he just go on his own platform?
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Happily.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	There’s common sense that leads one to conclude that the aid was withheld for the investigations and then there’s also direct evidence in that the President’s own words to Ambassador Sondland on September 7th said the same thing.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That is what Ambassador Sondland said… Or actually that’s what President Trump… Ambassador Sondland said to President Trump. Apologies.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, I think it’s important just for a second here to take a step back. It doesn’t matter when they knew, as long as they knew at some point. Then they realized at that point that the investigations were dependent on the aide. But in addition, there is a lot of evidence that they knew before it became public on August 28th.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It wasn’t released until the President got caught and all of the money didn’t actually get to Ukraine in that fiscal year, and you all in Congress had to pass another law to allow for the money to get to Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It’s a very good question. There are two things that were discussed here today. One is evidence and one are assertions and opinions. Based on the evidence, there is no evidence to support any of those three things that you just mentioned. There’s no evidence to think that the President acted towards Ukraine because of his concerns about corruption. Even if he held those concerns, that was not the motivating factor. There is no evidence that his concern about other European countries giving enough money motivated him, and there is certainly not a reasonable belief given all of the evidence that he believed that Ukraine interfered in our 2016 elections.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Can I respond? Are you trying to say that I… What are you trying to say? What is the implication here? But by the way, I didn’t give anything close to a million dollars remotely.
2019-12-09	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That was exactly the type of conduct that Vice President Biden wanted to shut down in Ukraine. That was exactly the type of anti non-anticorruption policies that Vice President Biden was objecting to using the official policy. So that’s one of the reasons that he… I mean, I don’t know if that was one, but that’s the type of thing that he based, he and the Americans and the Europeans based-
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Yovanovitch, on April 24th of this year at approximately 10:00 PM, you received a telephone call while you were at the embassy in Kiev, from the Director General of the State Department, and this was just three days after President Zelensky’s election and the call between President Trump and President Zelensky that we just heard from Ranking Member, Nunes. At the time that this urgent call came in, what were you in the middle of doing?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And her current Woman of Courage award stemmed from her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was it ever determined who threw the acid and killed her?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	After you stepped away from this anti-corruption event to take this call, what did the Director General tell you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What happened next?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You said you… there were concerns up the street. What did you understand that to mean?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did she explain in any more detail what she meant by concerns about your security?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did she explain what the urgency was for you to come back on the next flight?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, prior to this abrupt call back to Washington DC, had you been offered an extension of your post by the State Department?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	When was that request made?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So about a month and a half before this call?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did anyone at the State Department ever express concerns about your job performance?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, after you returned to Washington a couple of days after that, you met with the Deputy Secretary of State. And at your deposition, you said that Deputy Secretary of State told you that you had done nothing wrong but that there was a concerted campaign against you. What did he mean by that?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And who else was involved in this concerted campaign against you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And who from Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And at this time Mr. Lutsenko was the lead Prosecutor General, is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And had President Zelensky indicated whether or not he was going to keep him on after the election?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I believe you testified earlier that Mr. Lutsenko had a reputation for being corrupt. Is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, during this conversation, did the Deputy Secretary tell you about your future as the ambassador to Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did he say?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you have any indication that the State Department had lost confidence in you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And were you provided any reason why the president lost confidence in you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you testified at your deposition that you were told at some point that Secretary Pompeo had tried to protect you but that he was no longer able to do that. Were you aware of these efforts to protect you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And were you… Did you understand who he was trying to protect you from?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you have any understanding why Secretary Pompeo was no longer able to protect you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So just like that you had to leave Ukraine as soon as possible?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	How did that make you feel?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But you also told this deputy secretary that this was a dangerous precedent. What did you mean by that?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	How did the Deputy Secretary respond?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did he ever get back to you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what did he say to you then?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But he didn’t address the dangerous precedent that you flagged for him?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you understood, of course, that the president of the United States could remove you and that you served at the pleasure of the president. Is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But in your 33 years as a foreign service officer, have you ever heard of a president of the United States recalling another ambassador without cause based on allegations that the State Department itself knew to be false?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you testified in your opening statement that you had left Ukraine by the time of the July 25th call between President Trump and President Zelensky. When was the first time that you saw the call record for this phone call?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And prior to reading that call record, were you aware that President Trump had specifically made reference to you in that call?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What was your reaction to learning that?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What you mean by devastated?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, without upsetting you too much, I’d like to show you the excerpts from the call. And the first one where President Trump says the former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news. So I just want to let you know. What was your reaction when you heard the president of the United States refer to you as bad news?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The next excerpt when the president references you was a short one, but he said, “Well, she’s going to go through some things.” What did you think when President Trump told President Zelensky and you read that you were going to go through some things?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What were you concerned about?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you feel threatened?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	How so?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, in this same call where the president, as you just said, threatens you, to a foreign leader, he also praises, rather, the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor who led the false smear campaign against you. I want to show you another excerpt or two from the transcript or the call record, rather, where the president of the United States says, “Good, because I heard you have had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.” And he went on later to say, “I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor, so good luck with everything.” Now, Ambassador Yovanovitch, after nearly three years in Ukraine, where you tried to clean up the Prosecutor General’s office, was it the US embassy’s view that the former Prosecutor General was a very good and very fair prosecutor?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, he was rather corrupt, is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The Prosecutor General’s office is a long running problem in Ukraine, is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So how did you feel when you heard President Trump speak so highly of the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor who helped to execute the smear campaign to have you removed?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So this was not the uniform position of the official US policymakers, is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, let’s go back to the smear campaign that you referenced, and in March when you said it became public, and you previously testified that you had learned that Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s lawyer and representative who was also mentioned in that July 25th call, was in regular communication with the corrupt Prosecutor General in late 2018 and in early 2019. And at one point in your deposition, you said that they, that being Giuliani and the corrupt foreign Prosecutor General, had plans to “Do things to me.” What did you mean by that?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you subsequently understand a little bit more what that meant?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Who did you understand to be working with Mr. Giuliani as his associates in Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Those who the two who have been indicted in New York?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, at the end of March, this effort by Giuliani and his associates resulted in a series of articles in The Hill publication that were based on allegations in part from Lutsenko, the corrupt Prosecutor General, and just to summarize some of these allegations, there were among others three different categories. One category included the attacks against you, which you referenced in your opening statement, including that you had bad mouthed the president and had given the Prosecutor General a do not prosecute list. There was another that included allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, and then there was a third that related to allegations concerning Burisma and the Bidens. Is that accurate?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Were these articles and allegations then promoted by others associated with the president in the United States?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I’m going to show you a couple of exhibits, including a tweet here by President Trump himself on March 20th, which was the first day that one of these articles was published. It appears to be a quote that says “John Solomon: As Russia collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.” @seanhannity, @FoxNews. And then if I could go to another tweet four days later, this is the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., who tweets, “We need more @RichardGrenells,” who is the ambassador to Germany, is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	“And less of these jokers as ambassadors.” And it’s a retweet of one of John Solomon’s articles, or an article referencing the allegations that says, “Calls grow to remove Obama’s US ambassador to Ukraine.” Were you aware of these tweets at the time?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What was your reaction to seeing this?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What were you worried about?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And were you aware whether they received attention on prime time television on Fox News as well?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, was the allegation that you were badmouthing President Trump true?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was the allegation that you had created a do not prosecute list to give to the Prosecutor General in Ukraine true?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In fact, didn’t the corrupt Prosecutor General himself later recant those allegations?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, when these articles were first published, did the State Department issue a response?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, the statement addressed the falsity of the allegations themselves?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It didn’t say anything about your job performance in any way?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did anyone in the State Department raise any concerns with you or express any belief in these allegations?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, after these false allegations were made against you, did you have any discussions with anyone in leadership in the State Department about a potential statement of support from the department or the secretary himself?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	This is David Hale, the Under Secretary of Political Affairs, who’s the number three person at the State Department?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did he indicate to you that he supported such a statement of support for you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And your general understanding is that you did have the full support of the State Department, is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, during your 33 year career as a foreign service officer, did you ever hear of any serious concerns about your job performance?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was the statement of support ultimately issued for you?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you learn why not?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	How could it be undermined?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So, let me see if I got this right. You were one of the most senior diplomats in the State Department, you’d been there for 33 years, you’d won numerous awards, you’d been appointed as an ambassador three times by both Republican and Democratic presidents, and the State Department would not issue a statement in support of you against false allegations because they were concerned about a tweet from the president of the United States?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Yovanovitch, you indicated that those same articles in March that included the smear campaign also included allegations related to Ukraine’s interference in the 2016 election and the Burisma-Biden connection. Is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So I’m going to end my questioning where we were before, which was the July 25th call. And President Trump not only insults you and praises the corrupt Prosecutor General, but he also, as you know by now, references these two investigations. First, immediately after President Zelensky thanks President Trump for his “great support in the area of defense,” President Trump responds, “I would like you to do us a favor though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people, the server. They say Ukraine has it.” And then he goes on in that same paragraph to say, “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.” Now, Ambassador Yovanovitch, from your experience as the ambassador in Ukraine for almost three years, and understanding that President Zelensky was not in politics before he ran for president and was a new president on this call, how would you expect President Zelensky to interpret a request for a favor?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Fair to say that a president of Ukraine that is so dependent on the United States would do just about anything within his power to please the president of the United States if he could?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, are you familiar with these allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	There was nothing based in fact to support these allegations?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, who was responsible for interfering and meddling in the 2016 election?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Yovanovitch, are you aware that in February of 2017, Vladimir Putin himself promoted this theory of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, let me show you a press statement that President Putin made in a joint press conference with Viktor Orban of Hungary on February 2nd of 2017, where he says, “Second, as we all know, during the presidential campaign in the United States, the Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral position in favor of one candidate. More than that, certain oligarchs, certainly with the approval of the political leadership, funded this candidate, or female candidate, to be more precise.” Now, how would this theory of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election be in Vladimir Putin’s interest?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	An alternative narrative that would absolve his own wrongdoing?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And when he talks about an oligarch and he talks about the support of the Ukrainian government, there’s also a reference in the July 25th call to a wealthy Ukrainian. Is it your understanding that what Vladimir Putin is saying here in this press statement in February 2017 is similar to what President Trump says on the July 25th call related to the 2016 election?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now let me show you another exhibit from the call related to the Bidens, which I’m sure you’re familiar with. President Trump says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.” Now, are you familiar with these allegations related to Vice President Biden?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Do you know whether he ever went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution of anyone?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, when Vice President Biden acted to remove the former corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine, did he do so as part of official United States policy?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, if he helped to remove a corrupt Ukrainian Prosecutor General who was not prosecuting enough corruption, that would increase the chances that corrupt companies in Ukraine would be investigated, isn’t that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that could include Burisma, right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, at the time of this call, Vice President Biden was the front runner for the Democratic nomination for president and President Trump’s potential next opponent in the election. Is it your understanding that President Trump’s request to have Vice President Biden investigated, was that part of official US policy as you knew it?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right, but you’re familiar with. It didn’t change that much in two months, right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And were these two investigations part of the anti-corruption platform that you championed in Ukraine for three years?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In these investigations, do they appear to you to be to benefit the president’s personal and political interests rather than the national interest?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, just returning to the allegations in The Hill publication in March that were promoted by Mr. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, were those two allegations similar to the two allegations that the president wanted President Zelensky to investigate?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So ultimately in the July 25th phone call with the Ukrainian president, the president of the United States endorsed the false allegations against you and the Bidens, is that right?
0201-11-15	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just one follow up on that Ambassador Volker, when when you say, thread the needle, you mean that you understood the relationship between Vice President Biden’s son and Burisma, but you were trying to separate the two of them in your mind, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Understood. But you understood the relationship between Hunter Biden and Burisma-
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Let’s go back.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Let’s focus on the the July 25th call for a moment. And Mr. Morrison, July 25th was day number what for you as the senior director overseeing Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You testified in your deposition that you received an email on the morning of July 25th from Ambassador’s Sondland shortly before the call. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I believe in that email Ambassador Sondland told you that he had briefed President Trump in advance of the call, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You also testified that Ambassador Sondland had told you on another occasion that he could call the President whenever he wanted, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And on July 25th, did you in fact make an effort to confirm whether or not the phone call between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump actually occurred?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did it happen?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	On other occasions when Ambassador Sondland told you that he spoke with President Trump, on some other occasions did you also seek confirmation of that fact?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And on those occasions when you did seek to confirm that they had spoken, what did you find?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, I’m going to pull up a text message on the morning of July 25th, between, well, it should be another one. Oh yeah, sorry. Ambassador Sondland with you, Ambassador Volker. And at 7:54 in the morning, Ambassador Sondland says, “Call ASAP.” Then at 9:35 AM, Ambassador Volker, you respond, is the screen working in front of you or just to the side?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So if you could go ahead and read what you said.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	At 9:35 AM.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And who is Yermak?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, what was the message that you had received?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did you understand from that message that Ambassador Sondland had spoken to President Trump?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now on the screen in front of you is another text message from you that same morning-
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	At 8:36 in the morning to Andre Yermak.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In Ukraine, and so this is East coast time, that’s right. So this is slightly less than a half hour before the call between President Trump and President Zelensky.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And can you just read what you wrote there?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And does this accurately relay the message that you had received from Ambassador Sondland?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now Mr. Morrison, did the National Security Council also prepare talking points for President Trump for this call?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And per usual custom, were these talking points based on the official United States policy objectives?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And since there has been a little bit of dispute about what that means, can you explain how official U.S. policy is determined through the inter-agency process?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And there’s an extensive process to finalize any policy, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Morrison, you listened to this call on the 25th, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Where did you listen from?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In your deposition, you testified that the call was not what you were hoping to hear. What did you mean by that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Rada, which is the Ukrainian parliament, that election had occurred four days earlier?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And President Zelensky’s party won in a landslide, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So at least in Ukraine there was tremendous support for Zelensky’s anti-corruption agenda, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And within the inner agency, within the national security agencies here in the United States, was there broad support for President Zelensky?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And to that point he had shown that he had at least put his money where his mouth was for the three months that he had been in office, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now I’m going to show a couple of excerpts from this call record to each of you. The first is President Trump responding to a comment by President Zelensky related to defense support from the United States and the purchase of javelins. And President Trump then says, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine they say Crowdstrike .. I guess you have one of your wealthy people … the server, they say Ukraine has it.” And if we could go to the next excerpt, where President Trump says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden’s stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Mr. Morrison were these references to Crowdstrike, the server, 2016 election and to Vice President Biden and his son, were they included in the President’s talking points?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And were they consistent with what you understood at that time to be official U.S. policy?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, subsequent to this call, you did nothing to implement the investigations that President Trump … implement the request for the investigations that President Trump asked for, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you were not aware of anyone else within … you coordinate the inter-agency process and you were not aware of anyone else who was doing that either, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you testified in your deposition that hearing this call confirmed what you called the parallel process that your predecessor, Fiona Hill, had warned you about. What did you mean by that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And who did she inform you was involved in this parallel process?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And after she informed you of this company, Burisma, what if anything did you do to determine what that was?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did you find that it had some association with Hunter Biden?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now Ambassador Volker, you did not listen to this call but you testified that you were surprised and troubled when you read the call record after it was released on September 25th. And you also that after reading the call record, it was clear to you that the Biden, Burisma and the 2016 election investigations that President Trump discussed on the call were designed to serve the President’s political interests, not the national interest. What did you mean when you said that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Yes it was.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Mr. Morrison, shortly after you heard the July 25th call, you testified that you alerted the NSC legal advisor, John Eisenberg, pretty much right away, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you indicated in your opening statement, or at least from your deposition that you went to Mr. Eisenberg out of concern over the potential political fallout if the call record became public and not because he thought it was illegal, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But you you would agree, right, that asking a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival is inappropriate, would you not?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now in a second meeting with Mr. Eisenberg, what did you recommend that he do to prevent the call record from leaking?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Had you ever asked the NSC legal advisor to restrict access before?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you speak to your supervisor, Dr. Kupperman, before you went to speak to John Eisenberg?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you subsequently learn that the call record had been put in a highly classified system?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what reason did Mr. Eisenberg give you for why the call record was put in the highly classified system?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He said it was just a mistake?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now isn’t it also true though, that you had authority to restrict access on the regular system if you wanted to?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So why did you go to the NSC legal advisor to recommend that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you wanted them to review it because you were concerned about the potential political consequences, not because anything was wrong?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So just to make sure I understand this correctly, Mr. Morrison, you heard the call, you recognize that President Trump was not discussing the talking points that the NSC had prepared based on official U.S. policy and was instead talking about the investigations that Fiona Hill had warned you about, and then you reported it immediately to the NSC legal advisor. Is that the correct chain of events here?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Ambassador Volker in the July 25th call, President Zelensky volunteers to President Trump that Rudy Giuliani had already spoken with one of his associates and that President Zelensky hopes Giuliani will come to Ukraine. And in response, President Trump proceeds to mention Mr. Giuliani on three separate occasions during this call. You testified about a May 23rd meeting in the Oval Office where the President spoke quite negatively about Ukraine and how it tried to take him down. And that he also repeated some of the allegations that Mr. Giuliani was making, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. And those allegations were in the media, were they not?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And during that meeting, President Trump told you and Ambassador Sondland and Secretary Perry to talk to Giuliani, isn’t that correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So when he said, “talk to Rudy,” you didn’t take it for him to mean for you to talk to Rudy?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, after that meeting, did you in fact talk to Rudy?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ultimately, I think as you testified in your opening statement, you introduced Mr. Yermak to Mr. Giuliani and they eventually met, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, during this whole time in July and after the call into early August when they met, Ukraine still desperately wanted that Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky, correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you also wanted that for President Zelensky, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Why was that Oval Office meeting so important to President Zelensky?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	That certainly was your assessment, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And certainly you understood from your experience in Ukraine that there would be a significant boost in legitimacy at home for President Zelensky if there were photos of him in the Oval Office, et cetera, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you testified in your opening statement that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak, Zelensky’s aid met on August 2nd. Where did they meet?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did you learn that Mr. Giuliani-
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what did you learn that Mr. Giuliani requested anything of the Ukrainians at that meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We’ll get into that in a second. But Mr. Giuliani did not explain to you what needed to be included in that statement and that call you had?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. Let’s go through some of the text messages so we know exactly who said what. And first, let’s start on August 9th. This is a text exchange between you and Ambassador Sondland, where Ambassador Sondland writes at the top, “Morrison ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.” And what did you respond?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Sondland responded, “Not sure I did. I think POTUS really wants the deliverable.” And what did you say to that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Ambassador Sondland says, “Yep, clearly lots of convos going on.” Now, Mr. Morrison, you’re referenced in this text message. Had you discussed confirming a date for a White House visit for President Zelensky with Ambassador Sondland around this time?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did you have any discussions with him about a statement that Ukraine, that they were trying to get Ukraine to make?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Were you aware that… Do you yourself know what Ambassador Sondland meant by the deliverable?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what is your understanding now?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But this to your knowledge, was part of that parallel process you were talking about?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	If we can now go to the next exhibit, which is another text exchange just a few minutes later between Ambassador Sondland and you Ambassador Volker, where Ambassador Sondland says, “To avoid misunderstandings, might be helpful to ask Andrey for a draft statement embargoed so that we can see exactly what they propose to cover. Even though Ze, Zelensky, does a live presser, they can still summarize in a brief statement. Thoughts?” And how did you respond?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And this relates to the statement that Mr. Giuliani wanted. Is that right, Ambassador Volker?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And now to the next day on August 10th, there’s another text exchange between you and Mr. Yermak, who’s the same aid that Mr. Giuliani had met in Madrid. And if you could read what you wrote at the top at 5:02 PM.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Mr. Yermak responds, “Once we have a date, we will call for a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US Ukraine relationship, including among other things, Burisma and election meddling in investigations.” And what did you respond?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now the date that he’s referring to, that is the date for the White House visit.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now two days later on August 12th, you receive another text message from Mr. Yermak, which reads, “Special attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States, especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians. I want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.” Now Ambassador Volker, this was a draft, was it not of the statement that you and Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak and Ambassador Sondland had been discussing?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And it does not mention Burisma or the 2016 election interference, correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you testified in your deposition that you and Ambassador Sondland and Mayor Giuliani had a conversation about this draft after you received it. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Mr. Giuliani said that if the statement did not include Burisma and 2016 election, it would not have any credibility. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, this was the same Rudy Giuliani that President Trump was discussing in that May 23rd meeting and asked you and the others to talk to, correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And even at that point on May 23rd, you were aware of these investigations that he was publicly promoting. Correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Back in May, you knew that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now he was insisting on a public commitment from President Zelensky to do these investigations. Correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Oh, Burisma and the 2016 election.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And at the time that you were engaged in coordinating for this statement, did you find it unusual that there was such an emphasis on a public statement from President Zelensky to carry out the investigations that the president was seeking?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And perhaps he also wanted a public statement because it would lock President Zelensky in to do these investigations that he thought might benefit him?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, what we’re talking about is Burisma and the 2016 election. Let’s just, we can agree on that. And so when we’re talking about these investigations, isn’t it clear that a public statement would be important to Mr. Giuliani because it was politically useful to the president?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that would be helpful to get that White House meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In fact, it was a necessary condition as you understood at that point.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No, I understand that. But is it your testimony that based on the texts that you wrote linking the investigations and the 2016 election on July 25th to the White House meeting, you’re saying that by this point in August with this back and forth that you were unaware that this public statement was a condition for the White House meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Let’s go to the next day where there was another text exchange. And at the top could you just read the first text there?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then you’ll see the highlighted portion of the next text. The other is identical to your previous one and then it just adds including the… Including these involving Burisma and the 2016 elections. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that was what Mr. Giuliani insisted on adding to the statement?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And the Ukrainians ultimately did not issue this statement. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And President Zelensky ultimately did not get the oval office meeting either, did he?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now I want to move forward to September, in early September, when the security assistance begins to more overtly be used as leverage to pressure the Ukrainians to conduct these investigations that President Trump wanted. Mr. Morrison, you accompanied Vice President Pence to Warsaw when he met with President Zelensky. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Understood. You were at the bilateral meeting with the vice president and president Zelensky. Correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in that meeting, were the Ukrainians concerned about the hold on security clearance, military assistance rather?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did they say?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what was Vice President Pence’s response?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did he directly explain to the Ukrainians that those were the actual reasons for the holds, or was he just commenting on general concerns of the president?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And to your knowledge though on sort of the staff level as the coordinator of all the inter-agency process, you were not of any review of the Ukraine security assistance money, were you?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And the entire inter-agency supported the continuation of the security assistance, isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now after this larger meeting with Vice President Pence and President Zelensky, you testified at your deposition that you saw Ambassador Sondland immediately go over and pull Andrey Yermak aside and have a conversation. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what did ambassador Sondland tell you that he told Mr. Yermak?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you testified that you were not comfortable with what Ambassador Sondland had told you. Why not?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So now there’s a whole other wrinkle to it, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you told Ambassador Taylor about this conversation as well. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in your deposition you testified that his testimony other than one small distinction between President Zelensky and the prosecutor general was accurate as to what you told him. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And generally speaking, you confirmed everything that Ambassador Taylor told you except for that one thing and a small other ministerial matter relating to the location of a meeting. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now did you tell Ambassador Bolton about this conversation as well?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what was his response when you explained to him what Ambassador Sondland had said?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you go tell the lawyers?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did he explain to you why he wanted you to tell the lawyers?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now a few days later on September 7th, you spoke again to Ambassador Sondland who told you that he had just gotten off the phone with President Trump. Isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did Ambassador Sondland tell you that president Trump said to him?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And by that point did you understand that the statement related to the Biden in 2016 investigations?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that that was essentially a condition for the security assistance to be released?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	After speaking with President Trump?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now you testified that hearing this information gave you a sinking feeling. Why was that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you tell Ambassador Bolton about this conversation as well?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what did he say to you?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And why did he say to tell the lawyers?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But he’s not going to… He doesn’t tell you to go tell the lawyers because you’re running up on the eight day deadline there, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. And you weren’t going to go tell them because of that concern. Right? You were concerned about what you were hearing Ambassador Sondland relay to you. Correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So just so we’re clear, you reported two concerning conversations that you had with Ambassador Sondland to the lawyers in early September, in which you understood from him that the president was withholding security assistance as additional leverage to get Ukraine to publicly announce the specific political investigations that President Trump had discussed on the July 25th call. Is that accurate?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. And you understood though that the investigations that Ambassador Sondland was referring to were the two that President Trump referenced on the July 25th call, correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And during this early September time period, Mr. Morrison, did you have any conversations with Ambassador Volker about any of this?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what do you recall about that conversation?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what do you recall saying to him about the separate process?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you explain to him what your understanding of events was?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. And Ambassador Volker, do you recall this conversation?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, that’s a good segue to our next exhibit, which is a September 8th text exchange with you and Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Sondland. And at the top, Ambassador Sondland says, “Guys, multiple convos with Z. That’s Zelensky. POTUS. Let’s talk.” And then Ambassador Taylor about 15-16 minutes later says, “Gordon and I just spoke. I can brief you, meaning you Ambassador Volker, if you and Gordon don’t connect.” Approximately one hour later, Ambassador Taylor says, “The nightmare is they give the interview and don’t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. And I quit.” And then at the bottom about five hours later, how do you respond?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So you were not in the loop in terms of all of these conversations that Ambassador Taylor, Mr. Morrison, Ambassador Sondland were having?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And now ultimately the hold was lifted on September 11th. Is that right Ambassador Volker?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. And Mr. Morrison, were you aware that prior to September 11th that there was a whistleblower complaint circulating around the White House?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But you were aware of a request to preserve records, were you not?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And one final question. When was the hold lifted?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Which is two days after the Congress announced an investigation. Were you aware of that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I yield.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you, Mr chairman. Ambassador Volker, I do want to just correct the record from the first round. You were right to point out, you asked if a quote that I represented you made in the deposition was your words. And I actually read the wrong part in the quote. What you actually said was, it creates a problem again where all of the things that we’re trying to do to advance the bilateral relationship, strengthen our support for Ukraine, strengthen the positioning against Russia, is now getting sucked into a domestic political debate in the US domestic political narrative that overshadows that. So you were right to point that out, and I apologize for the mistake. I want to go back to a couple of things that you said during the minorities round. Can you repeat again with the readout that you got of the July 25th call?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. And I believe you said that readout was exactly as you expected the call to go. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. I just want to show you once again the July 25th text that you wrote to Andrey Yermak, which was the message that you were relaying to him, so that he could prepare President Zelensky. And you’ll recall this, right, where you said, that this was the message. Good lunch. Thanks. Heard from White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump, he will investigate quote, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. That’s what you expected from the call, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. But you don’t mention corruption in this text, do you?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The word corruption is not in this text.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You say a couple of times in your opening statement, and you just said it again. That is, investigating things that happened in the past. You are aware of course that most investigations relate to things that happened in the past, right? Sorry?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay, so that doesn’t really move the needle, whether it’s current or past, in terms of the subject of the investigation, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You also talked a little bit about the meeting that you had on July 26th with Presidents Zelensky and Ambassador Sondland in Kiev. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I believe you testified that the topic of investigations did not come up at all, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You didn’t take notes of that call, of that meeting, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right because you had, there were staffers there to do that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And so if there are two staffers who took notes of that meeting and testified that the subject of either sensitive topics or investigations came up, are we better off taking their word for it than yours?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. Another witness testified before us, Laura Cooper, about a meeting that she had with you on August 20th. Do you recall having that meeting with her? Because you didn’t mention it in your deposition?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And she recalled with some specificity that meeting, which I believe was also based on her notes, that you described the statement that you were trying to get President Zelensky to make to, and I’ll quote what she said, disavow interference in US elections, and commit to the prosecution of individuals involved in election interference. And if he were to agree to do that, she testified, then you thought that it might help to lift the hold on security assistance. Is that your recollection of the conversation as well?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So how does yours differ?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	All right, well so that’s a different interpretation. But you don’t doubt that what she testified is inaccurate, do you?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. You testified a little bit about the June 28th conference call that you had with Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor. I’m not sure if Deputy Secretary Kent was on the line.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Secretary Perry, before you looped in President Zelensky. Am I right about the participants of that? Or was Secretary Perry not on it?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Were there any staff members or note takers on the call?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Why?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And at that point we’ve had other testimony from people who did take notes, that there was a discussion about the investigations, or what you needed to do, what President Zelensky needed to do, in order to get the White House meeting? Do you recall that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, you understood that the investigations were Burisma and the 2016 election, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. And you interpreted those to be… You interpreted those to be okay because in theory they were looking into Ukrainians?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. But we can agree, can we not, that the investigations, all the investigations that we’re talking about here today were Burisma and the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. Now, and what you then amended your testimony today to say, is that in retrospect, if you did not realize that the purpose for Mr. Giuliani and President Trump to want the Burisma investigation was for political benefits in digging up dirt or getting some information on Vice President Biden. That’s what you learned subsequently, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, you knew that Ambassador Sondland was pursuing this at the July 10th meeting when he raised these investigations himself.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right, I understand. But Biden wasn’t mentioned, but you do agree that when investigations are referenced in this context, it is Burisma and the 2016 election, no?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. And on that July 10th call, when Ambassador Sondland raised the investigations, he did that in response to a question from the Ukrainians about the White House meeting. Isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You said that Ambassador Sondland mentioned a specific investigations at the July 10th meeting in Ambassador Bolton’s office. And you said that you thought that was inappropriate.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Didn’t he make that comment in response to a question from the Ukrainian officials about when they could schedule the White House meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in the July 2nd or third meeting in Toronto that you had with Presidents Zelensky, you also mentioned investigations to him, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And again, you were referring to the Burisma and the 2016-
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. And you understood that that’s what the Ukrainians interpreted, references to investigations to be related to Burisma and the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Mr. Morrison, when did you have that conversation with Fiona Hill about Burisma and the parallel track involving Ambassador… Parallel process rather involving Ambassador Sondland and Rudy Giuliani. Do you recall?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. So in that period of time, you were certainly aware of this effort to promote this Burisma investigation that Ambassador Sondland and Rudy Giuliani were going about, or at least you had heard about it from Dr. Hill?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. I want to pull up another excerpt from a recent Wall Street Journal article that quotes an email, from July 13th, that Ambassador Sondland sent to you. And he wrote to you, quote, “Sole purpose is for Zelensky to give POTUS assurances of new sheriff in town. Corruption ending, unbundling moving forward. And any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently.” And you responded, “Tracking.” What did you understand Ambassador Sondland to mean when he wrote to you “any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently”?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. But it was before this that Dr. Hill had told you about Burisma and Ambassador Sondland in particular, his desire for this parallel process to investigate Burisma, right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So you had that association when you received his email, asking you about investigations, correct?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	No?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Why not?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You were not endorsing the notion of President Zelensky’s sending a message about investigations. Is that your testimony?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Okay. Ambassador Volker, I’m going to jump ahead. After the aid was released, you went to the Yes conference, right, in Ukraine? And are you aware that Ambassador Taylor, who testified based on quite detailed notes, indicated that earlier, a few days before that Ambassador Sondland had told him that President Trump is a businessman. And so before he writes a check, he likes to see people pay up. Something to that effect. You’re aware of that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you’re also familiar that Ambassador Taylor said that you said something very similar to him, when you were in Ukraine for the Yes conference. Do you recall saying that to Ambassador Taylor?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in what context did Ambassador Sondland say that to you?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. And the pay up before he writes the check is to get the investigations that he wants. Isn’t that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did you think it meant?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr Chairman, I yield back.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Good morning to both of you.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	On July 25th, at approximately 9:00 AM, you both were sitting in the situation room, probably not too much further away than you are right now. And you were preparing for a long awaited phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. Now, Colonel Vindman, in advance of this phone call, did you prepare talking points as you did for the April 21st call?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What were those talking points based upon?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In other words, they’re based on official U.S. policy?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And is there a process to determine official U.S. policy?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And as you listened to the call, did you observe whether President Trump was following the talking points based on the official U.S. policy?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Let’s take a look at a couple of excerpts from this call. Right after President Zelensky thanked President Trump for the United States’ support in the area of defense, President Trump asks President Zelensky for a favor and then raises this theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He says in the highlighted portion, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Colonel Vindman was this statement based on the official talking points that you had prepared?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And was this statement related to the 2016 Ukraine interference in the 2016 election a part of the official U.S. policy?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, at the time of this July 25th call, Colonel Vindman, were you aware of a theory that Ukraine had intervened or interfered in the 2016 U.S. election?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Are you aware of any credible evidence to support this theory?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Are you also aware that Vladimir Putin had promoted this theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And ultimately, which country did U.S. intelligence services determine to have interfered in the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Let’s go to another excerpt from this call where President Trump asked President Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, Vice President Joe Biden.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Here President Trump says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me” he said.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Again, Colonel Vindman, was this included in your talking points?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Is such a request to investigate a political opponent consistent with official U.S. policy?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now are you aware of any credible allegations or evidence to support this notion that Vice President Biden did something wrong or against U.S. policy with regard to Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ms. Williams, are you familiar with any credible evidence to support this theory of against Vice President Biden?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Ms. Williams, prior to the July 25th call, approximately how many calls between the President of the United States and foreign leaders had you listened to?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Had you ever heard a call like this?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You testified that you thought it was political in nature. Why did you think that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And so you thought that it could potentially be designed to assist President Trump’s reelection effort?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Colonel Vindman, you said in your deposition that “it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the political benefits of the president’s demands.” For those of us who are not rocket scientists, can you explain what you meant by that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Colonel Vindman, you testified that President Trump’s request for a favor from President Zelensky would be considered as a demand to President Zelensky. After this call, did you ever hear from any Ukrainians either in the United States or Ukraine, about any pressure that they felt to do these investigations that President Trump demanded?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you have any discussions with officials at the Ukrainian Embassy here in Washington D.C.?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you discuss at all the demand for investigations with them?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you discuss at all, at any point, their concerns about the hold on security assistance?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that was before it became public, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what did you respond?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You testified that one of your concerns about the request for investigations related to U. S. domestic politics was that Ukraine may lose bipartisan support. Why was that a concern of yours?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So in other words, Ukraine is heavily dependent on United States support, both diplomatically, financially, and also militarily?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Colonel Vindman, what languages do you speak?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Do you recall what language President Zelensky spoke on this July 25th phone call?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I want to look at the third excerpt from the July 25th call. Chairman Schiff addressed this with you in his questioning, and you see in the highlighted portion, it says, “Specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.” Is that the portion of the call record that, Colonel Vindman, you thought President Zelensky actually said “Burisma”?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you’ve testified earlier that his use of, or his understanding that when President Trump mentioned the Bidens, that that referred to the company, Burisma, sounded to you like he was prepped or prepared for this call. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I want to go to the next slide if we could, which is actually a text message that neither of you is on, but this is from Ambassador Kurt Volker to Andriy Yermak. Colonel Vindman, who’s Andriy Yermak?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, this text message is less than a half hour before the call on July 25th, and since neither of you are on it, I’ll read it. It says, from Ambassador Volker, “Good lunch. Thanks. Heard from White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck. See you tomorrow. Kurt.” Now is this the sort of thing that you’re referring to when you say that it sounded like President Zelensky was prepared for this call?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, turning to the fourth excerpt from the July 25th call where Ukraine’s President Zelensky links the White House meeting to the investigations that President Trump requests, Presidents Zelensky says, “I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington, DC. On the other hand, I also wanted to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation.” Colonel Vindman, when President Zelensky says, “On the other hand,” would you agree that he’s acknowledging a linkage between the White House visit that he mentions in the first sentence and the investigations that he mentions in the second sentence?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And if that is the case, that would be consistent with the text message that Ambassador Volker sent to Andriy Yermak right before the call. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you testified in your deposition that a White House visit, an Oval Office visit is very important to President Zelensky. Why is that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It would provide him with some additional legitimacy at home?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Just to summarize, in this July 25th call between the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that of you acknowledge were for President Trump’s political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much desired White House meeting for President Zelensky. Colonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts that we just looked at?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ms. Williams?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Colonel Vindman, you immediately reported this call to the NSC lawyers. Why did you do that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We’re going to discuss that July 10th meeting in a moment. But when you say alternative false narratives, are you referring to the two investigations that President Trump referenced in the call?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, at some point, did you also discuss how the written summary of the call records should be handled with the NSC lawyers?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did you understand they concluded?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	To preserve the integrity of the transcript, what did that mean?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	If there was real interest in preserving the integrity of the transcript, don’t you think they would have accepted your correction that Burisma should’ve been included?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You said two substantive issues. What was the other one?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So-
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It’s-
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Instead of an ellipses, it should’ve said to what you heard that there are recordings?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you ultimately learn where the call record was put?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Why? Why would it be put on a separate secure system?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But can’t you also limit the number of people who can access it on the regular system?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Ellis are the NSC lawyers?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But it was your understanding that it was not a mistake to put it on the highly classified system, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was it intended to be put on the highly classified system by the lawyers, or was it a mistake that it was put there?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you testified, both of you, about the April 21st call a little earlier, and Colonel Vindman, you indicated that you did include in your talking points the idea of Ukraine rooting out corruption but that President Trump did not mention corruption. I want to go to the White House readout from the April 21st call. At the… I’m not going to read the whole thing, but do you see the highlighted portion where it says “root out corruption”?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	In the end, this readout was false. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So it is a part of US official policy that Ukraine should root out corruption even if President Trump did not mention it in that April 21st phone call, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	He also did not mention it in the July 25th phone call, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Even though it was included in his talking points for the April 21st call, and presumably even though you can’t talk about it for the July 21st call, it was not included in either. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You did not mention it in either, rather.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	When the President says now that he held up security assistance because he was concerned about rooting out corruption in Ukraine, that concern was not expressed in the two phone conversations that he had with President Zelensky earlier this year. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, Ms. Williams, you testified that earlier that after this April 21st call, President Trump asked Vice President Pence to attend President Zelensky’s inauguration. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that on May 13th, you were just informed by the Chief of Staff’s office that Vice President Pence will not be going per request of the President. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And didn’t know what had changed from April 21st to May 13th. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, Colonel Vindman, since you in particular-
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, Colonel Vindman, since you in particular a little bit more perhaps than Ms. Williams who has a broader portfolio focuses on Ukraine, I want to ask you if you were aware of the following things that happen from April 21st to May 13th. Were you aware that Ambassador Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled from Ukraine in that time?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Were you aware that President Trump-
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So she learned about it after April 21st on April 24th. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And were you aware that President Trump had a telephone call with President Putin during this time period in early May?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And were you aware that Rudy Giuliani had planned a trip to go to Ukraine to pressure the Ukrainians to initiate the two investigations that President Trump mentioned on the July 25th call in this time period?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I want to move now to that July 10th meeting that you referenced, Colonel Vindman. What exactly did Ambassador Sondland say when the Ukrainian officials raised the idea of a White House meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what happened to the broader meeting after he made that reference?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you have any conversations with Ambassador Bolton about this meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you follow Ambassador Sondland and the others to the ward room for meeting followup?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Were the investigations, the specific investigations that Ambassador Sondland referenced in the larger meeting also discussed in the ward room meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did Ambassador Sondland say?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	How did you respond, if at all?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was Ambassador Volker in this meeting as well?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Was this statement made in front of the Ukrainian officials?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	The senior White House staff you’re referring to, does that include Fiona Hill, your immediate supervisor at the time?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now you said you also reported this incident to the NSC lawyers, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What was their response?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Why did you report this meeting and this conversation to the NSC lawyers?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So am I correct, Colonel Vindman, that at least no later than that July 10th meeting, the Ukrainians had understood or at least heard that the oval office meeting that they so desperately wanted was conditioned on these specific investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And directly linking the White House meeting to the investigations?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ms. Williams, you testified that in your opening statement that you attended the September 1st meeting between Vice President Pence and President Zelensky in Warsaw. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What was the first thing that President Zelensky asked Vice President Pence about at that meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you testified in your deposition that in that conversation, President Zelensky emphasized that the military assistance, the security assistance, was not just important to assist Ukraine in fighting a war against Russia, but that it was also symbolic in nature. What did you understand him to mean by that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that if the United States was holding the security assistance, is it also true then that Russia could see that as a sign of weakening US support for Ukraine and take advantage of that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did Vice President Pence provide a reason for the hold on security assistance to the Ukrainian president in that meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did Vice President Pence report back to President Trump on that meeting? To your knowledge?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Are you also aware, however, that the security assistance hold was not lifted for another 10 days after this meeting?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And am I correct that you didn’t learn the reason why the holds was lifted?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Colonel Vindman, you didn’t learn a reason why the hold was lifted either, is that right?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Colonel Vindman, are you aware that the committee’s launched an investigation into Ukraine matters on September 9th two days before the hold was lifted?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And on September 10th, the intelligence committee requested the whistleblower complaint from the Department of National Intelligence. Are you aware of that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Were you aware the White House was aware of this whistleblower complaint prior to that date?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So is it accurate to say, Colonel Vindman, that that whatever reason that was provided for the hold, including the administrative policies, which would support the security assistance, is that right to your understanding?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I was just asking that the administrative policies of President Trump supported the security assistance. Is that your understanding?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Thank you. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you’ve testified in your deposition that a White House visit, an Oval Office visit, is very important to President Zelensky. Why is that?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	It would provide him with some additional legitimacy at home?
0201-11-19	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So just to summarize, in this July 25th call between the President of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that both of you acknowledge were for President Trump’s political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much desired White House meeting for President Zelensky. Colonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts that we just looked at?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Taylor, on the heels of you discussing the importance of the security assistance to Ukraine, I want to go to the end of the timeline where you learned that security assistance was conditioned on Ukraine announcing the investigations that the president wanted. And in particular on September 9th of this year, you texted Ambassador Sondland and Volker. And the text message should be on the screen in front of you. And if you could read what you wrote.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did you mean when you said you thought it was crazy?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	When you say all of what we were trying to do, what do you mean by we?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	When you reference help with a political campaign and it’s in this text message, what did you mean?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that investigation at the very least was mentioned by president Trump in the July 25th phone call with President Zelensky, is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Taylor, in your decades of military service and diplomatic service representing the United States around the world, have you ever seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the president of the United States?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Kent, that vital military assistance that was not the only thing that President Trump was withholding from Ukraine. What else was contingent on Ukraine initiating these investigations?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	How important to President Zelensky was a White House meeting?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And President Zelensky was a relatively new president, is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Would a White House meeting for President Zelensky boost his legitimacy as a new president in Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Mr. Ken, is pressuring Ukraine to conduct what I believe you’ve called political investigations, a part of US foreign policy to promote the rule of law in Ukraine and around the world?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Is it in the national interest of the United States?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Why not?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So in other words, it is a purpose of our foreign policy to encourage foreign nations to refrain from conducting political investigations. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Taylor, now that we’ve established that you ultimately did understand that President Trump was withholding the security assistance in a White House meeting from Ukraine until they announced these investigations to benefit his reelection campaign. Let’s go back a little bit in time to when you first learned about this conditionality. And on September 1st, so a little more than a week before that text we just read, you sent another text to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, which should also beyond the screen in front of you. And if you could read what you wrote to them.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Ambassador Sondland responded, “Call me.” Now, what information had you learned that prompted you to write this text message?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You said previously that you were alarmed to learn this. Why were you alarmed?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now Ambassador Taylor, you in your opening statement, you outlined a very detailed timeline and in fact we have a written copy here and you included some phrases and words in quotations. Did you take notes of this conversation on September 1st with Ambassador Sondland?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you take notes related to most of the conversations, if not all of them, that you recited in your opening statement?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What are those quotations that you include in your opening statement reflect?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you review those notes before you drafted your opening statement and came here to testify again?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now is that how, for example, you remember that Ambassador Sondland was on a train from Paris to London during a call in July?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you are aware, I presume, that the state department has not provided those notes to the committee, is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So we don’t have the benefit of reviewing them to ask you these questions.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, we would welcome that.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You also testified earlier Ambassador Taylor, that President Trump had delegated some matters overseeing Ukraine policy to Ambassador Sondland, who was a big inaugural supporter of President Trump, even though Ukraine is not in his domain of the European Union. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you come to understand that Ambassador Sondland had a direct line of communication into President Trump?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you testified, or rather in that text message, Ambassador Sondland says to call him after you wrote that. Did you in fact call him?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what did he say to you?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But did he say anything after that? Did he describe to you? I believe you said, I’ll refresh your memory, that you mentioned something in your opening statement, you said that he said that everything, and you had that in quotes, was actually contingent on the initiation of these investigations. What did he mean by everything?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And I believe you also testified that he said he had made a mistake in relaying a message to the Ukrainians. What was that mistake?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So it was not just the White House meeting, it was also the security assistance.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And so even though President Trump was saying repeatedly that there is no quid pro quo, Ambassador Sondland relayed to you that the facts of the matter were that the White House meeting and the security assistance were conditioned on the announcement of these investigations.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Assistants were conditioned on the announcement of these investigations. Is that your understanding?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, you reference a television interview and a desire for President Trump to put Zelensky in a public box, which you also have in quotes. Was that in your notes?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did you understand that to mean, to put Zelensky in a public box?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did you understand why it was needed to be in public? As opposed to a private confirmation?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, during this time period in early September, did you come to understand that from your conversations with the Ukrainians or other individuals that Ukraine felt pressure to initiate these investigations because of the conditionality of the White House meeting and the security assistance?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now you also described a conversation that you had with Ambassador Sondland, a week later on September 8th, and in that conversation, in your opening statement, you described how Ambassador Sondland used the term stalemate. What did you understand the concern about a stalemate to be?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So even though he said the words, there were no quid pro quo, he then went on to say, “But the security assistance will not come unless these investigations are done.” Is that what you’re saying?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	You also described in your opening statement a discussion you had about President Trump being a businessman who wanted to have people pay up before signing the check and what did you understand that to mean?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did Ukraine owe anything to the United States?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But you understood the upshot of this comment made by both Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker to be that President Trump believed that Ukraine owed him something personally. Is that accurate?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. But what he was talking about as you understood it, because in the context of the conversation is that what he owed him were these investigations that he won, is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And those investigations into the 2016 election and Biden and Burisma.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, during this early period in September, we’ve talked a little bit about the fact that you continually heard that the President was repeatedly saying that there was no quid pro quo. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And he still says that repeatedly today, but regardless of what you call it, whether it’s a quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, abuse power of the office of the presidency, the fact of the matter, as you understood it, is that security assistance and the White House meeting, were not going to be provided unless Ukraine initiated these two investigations that would benefit Donald Trump’s reelection. Is that what you understood the facts to be?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you heard that from Ambassador Sondland himself, correct?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you also heard a similar story from Mr. Morrison as well. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And what Mr. Morrison recounted to you was substantially similar to what Mr. Sondland recounted to you, right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And so regardless of what Ukrainians may say now, now that everything is out in the public and we’re here in this public hearing that they felt no pressure from President Trump. It was your clear understanding, was it not? That in early September when the pressure campaign was still secret that the Ukrainians believed that they needed to announce these public investigations? Is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And that CNN interview was to announce these investigations as you understood it. Right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	We’ve been focused a lot on the September timeframe, but I want to go back two months to July before the July 25th call, and you testified Ambassador Taylor in your opening statement that it was in the middle of July when you understood that the White House meeting was first a condition on these investigations. Is that accurate?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you described in your opening statement a July 10th white house meeting with a number of officials where Ambassador Bolton used the term that something was a drug deal. What did you understand him to mean in hearing that he said that, use this term drug deal?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And was that in reference to a discussion in that meeting related to the white house meeting that President Zelensky wanted and in connection to the investigations?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And did Ambassador Sondland say this in front of the Ukrainian officials to your understanding?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Ukrainian officials were there?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, around this same time in mid July, did you have any discussions with Ukrainian officials about these investigations?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Well, let me show you a text message that you wrote on July 21st where you wrote it again to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker. And if you could just read what you wrote here on July 21st.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Sasha Danyliuk, I think you just said is Ambassador Bolton’s counterpart, right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	What did you understand it to mean that Zelensky had concerns about being an instrument in Washington domestic reelection politics.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And would you agree that because President Zelensky is worried about this, they understood at least that there was some pressure for them to pursue these investigations? Is that fair?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, I’m going to move ahead now to July 25th, which was when President Trump and President Zelensky had the phone call. But before we get to the phone call, I want to show both of you a text message. Neither of you is on this text message. It is between Ambassador Volker and Andriy Yermak, a top aid to President Zelensky. I will read it because neither of you is on it.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Ambassador Volker says, “Good lunch. Thanks. Heard from White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate/get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck. See you tomorrow. Kurt.” And this was less than a half hour before the call actually occurred.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now Ambassador Taylor, was Ambassador Volker with you in Ukraine at this time?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Did you know that he was prepping President Zelensky for this phone call with President Trump in this way?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Understood. And you testified earlier that the security assistance had already been frozen to your knowledge, at least by July 18th. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So that was just a week earlier than this?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So just so we’re clear, Ambassador Taylor, before this July 25th call, President Trump had frozen the security assistance that Ukraine needed and that the White House meeting was conditioned on Ukraine initiating this investigation and that had been relayed to the Ukrainians. Is that an accurate state of play at this time?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Right. But you understood that the White House meeting?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	All right. Let’s move ahead to this July 25th call between the Presidents. Now, am I correct that neither of you were on this call? Is that right, Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And you were neither as well?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So you both read it after it was released publicly at the end of September?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	I want to spend just a little time reading the transcript as we’ve been encouraged to do. And I want to particularly note four excerpts of the transcript. One that relates to the security assistance we’ve been talking about, another that discusses a favor that President Trump asked of President Zelensky, a third where President Trump asks the Ukrainian President to investigate his political opponent, former Vice President Biden, and then a final one where the Ukrainian President directly links the desired White House visit to the political investigations that President Trump wanted.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	So let’s look at the first excerpt, which is near the beginning of the call when President Zelensky discusses the military aid that the US provides to Ukraine. He says, “I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically, we are almost ready to buy more javelins from the United States for defense purposes.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, at the time of this phone call, Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, you both knew that the aide had been frozen. Is that right?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Ambassador Taylor, you testified that President Trump obviously also knew that the aid had been frozen as well since he was responsible for doing that. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But to neither of your knowledge, the Ukrainians were not aware of that at that point?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	But right after President Zelensky thanks President Trump for his great support in the area of defense, president Trump then says … And we’ll go to the next excerpt, ” I want you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say CrowdStrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has it.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And then at the end of the paragraph he says, “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.” Now, Mr. Kent, you’ve testified a little bit about how important this White House meeting was to Presidents Zelensky. How would you expect a new Ukrainian President to interpret a request for a favor from the President of the United States?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Obviously you can’t put yourself in the mind, but if the Ukrainian President for a country that’s so dependent on the United States for all things, including military assistance, is requested to do a favor, how do you think the Ukrainians would interpret that?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now when he talks about this CrowdStrike in a server, what do you understand this to be a reference to?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Do you now understand what it relates to?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, are you aware that this is all part of a larger allegation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And to your knowledge, is there any factual basis to support the allegation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And in fact, who did interfere in the 2016 election?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Let’s move to the third excerpt that I mentioned related to Vice President Biden and it says, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son.” This is President Trump speaking, “That Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it, it sounds horrible.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now at the time of this call, Vice President Biden was the front runner for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 election. And Mr. Kent, are you familiar as you indicate in your opening statement about these allegations related to Vice President Biden?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And to your knowledge, is there any factual basis to support those allegations?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	When Vice President Biden acted in Ukraine, did he act in accordance with official US policy?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now let’s go to then the last excerpts that I wanted to highlight, which is President Zelensky speaking. And he says, “I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and we will work on the investigation.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now Ambassador Taylor, right after President Zelensky mentions is much desired Washington visit he says, “On the other hand.” And then says that Ukraine will be very serious about the investigation. Is this the same link between the White House visit and the investigations that Ambassador Volker had texted to Andriy Yermak just a few minutes before this conversation?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Now, just to summarize what we’ve just read in this July 25th call between the Presidents, the Ukrainian President thanked President Trump for security assistance that President Trump had just frozen. To which President Trump responded that he wanted President Zelensky to do him a favor though by investigating the 2016 US election and the Bidens.
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	Then President Zelensky says that he will pursue these investigations right after he mentions the White House visit. Is that your understanding Ambassador Taylor, of what we just read?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	And Mr. Kent, is that yours?
2019-11-13	Daniel Goldman	Lawyer-D	Lawyer-D	All right. I yield back.  Republican Counsel Steve Castor’s Questioning of George Kent and Bill Taylor
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Good morning, Ambassador. How are you?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Welcome back. You’re here all day on the 17th, late into the night, so thank you for your cooperation with the investigation. Did the president ever tell you personally about any preconditions for anything?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, so the president never told you about any preconditions for the aid to be released?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The president never told you about any preconditions for a White House meeting?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You said you didn’t have your records or your documents from the State Department, but if you did, there wouldn’t be any document or record that ties president Trump personally to any of this. Correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Your documents or records.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	okay, good heavens. Okay, you testified Mr. Giuliani’s requests for a quid pro quo for the White House meeting, and you indicated that you believe that was, he was evincing President Trump’s interests, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, but you testified that Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president. Correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But, how did you know that? Who told you?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right, but at your deposition, you said the question was at the May 23rd meeting, when the president said, “Go talk to, go talk to Rudy,” you responded, “He didn’t even say go talk. [inaudible 01:03:55] talk to Rudy.” You subsequently said, “It was sort of like, I don’t want to talk about this.” So, it wasn’t an order or a direction to go talk with …
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I want to talk about this. So it wasn’t an order or a direction to go talk with Mr. Giuliani, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And then that was May 23rd and then you never had any personal communications with Giuliani until August, right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Volcker was handling, Ambassador Volker was he the primary- [crosstalk 01:04:25].
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Ambassador Volker, you testified he’s a professional diplomat, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you said you had a great relationship with him?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You said he was a very smart guy.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ambassador Ivanovich said he’s a brilliant diplomat in fact. Do you agree with that?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You stated that he’s one of those people I’d hand my wallet too.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And so did you hear his testimony yesterday?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Because he didn’t-
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He didn’t have any, he didn’t have any evidence of any of these preconditions. And he was the one most engaged with the Ukrainians, wasn’t he?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. I mean, you testified and you know this was his full time job, although he was doing it for free.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you testified you came in and out of the events, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. All right. Your deposition and we asked you about your communications with the President and we asked you whether there were so many that it would be impossible to chronicle and you said no, it wasn’t that many, and we went down the path of building a list of communications you remember with the President, right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And we talked about May 23rd and the Oval Office.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You mentioned on July 25th before you went to Ukraine, you called the President, but there was no material information on the 25th call, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Then the last Friday, Mr. Holmes came in and I guess his testimony refreshed your recollection?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And talking about President Zelensky loving the President and so forth.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And then the next time, you know, we tried to unpack this, the next time you talked with the President was on the telephone was September 9th according to your deposition, right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But in September 9th at least at your deposition, you were extremely clear, you’ve called the President, you said he was feeling cranky that day. Right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you said in no uncertain terms, and this is on the heels of the Bill Taylor text, right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And why don’t you tell us, what did the President say to you on September 9th that you remember?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you believe the President, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And at that point in time the aid was paused for 55 days. There was a news article in Politico on August 28th talking about it. So by that point in time, the President had been receiving calls from senators. He had been getting pressure to lift the aid, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I want to turn back to your opener on page five under, when you talk about in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you acknowledge that this is speculation, right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. That it was a guess. In fact, I think you even said this morning-
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But you didn’t have any evidence of that, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But did it Ambassador Volker clue you in that that was the issue? I mean this is a pretty high, I mean this is a pretty serious conclusion you’ve reached without precise evidence.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, we can turn to that. And then that was your email dated what date?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, your email with secretary Pompeo, is that, was that August 11th? 16th.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So you’re asking secretary Pompeo whether we should block time and I mean, is there any discussion of specific investigations? Is there any discussion of Biden or Burisma or anything linking to aid in this email that you sent to Pompeo? [crosstalk 01:11:06].
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But at that point in time, we’re talking about investigations into the origins of the 2016 election. We’re not talking about anything to do with Joe Biden.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Stepping back a page to your email to the state department on August 11th, you emailed Secretary Pompeo and you say, “Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Zelensky to be delivered for our review in a day or two.” And the question I have here is that, I mean that statement never was issued. And in fact, Ambassador Volker has testified that he didn’t think it was a good idea and ultimately the Ukrainians didn’t think it was a good idea. And so the statement never reached a finalized state.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But even if it had it doesn’t talk about Biden’s or Burisma or anything insidious.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And have you heard Ambassador Volker how he talks about what might be an investigation into Burisma?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. I mean he has said that if there were Ukrainians engaged in violations of Ukrainian law, then the prosecutor general with the new administration ought to investigate that. Did Ambassador Volker ever relate that to you?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But it had nothing to do with the Vice President Biden.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. I want to turn to the letter from Senator Johnson. When he heard about some of these issues in the hold of the aid he wanted, he called the President. He called the President on August 31st it’s page six of his letter. Senator Johnson states or he rights, “I asked him, the President whether there was some kind of arrangement where Ukraine would take some action and the hold would be lifted. Without hesitation, President Trump immediately denied such an arrangement existed.” And Senator Johnson quotes the President saying, “No,” and he prefaced it with a different word. “No way. I would never do that. Who told you that? I have,” Senator Johnson says, “I have accurately characterize the President’s reaction is adamant, vehement and angry.” Senator Johnson’s telephone call with the President wasn’t a public event. It was capturing a genuine, you know, moment with the President. And he had at this point in time on August 31st he was adamant, vehement and angry that there was no connections to aid. There were no preconditions.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But you have no reason to disbelieve that wasn’t the way it went down, right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And now that you’ve had some time since your deposition and you submitted an addendum relating to the Warsaw get together with Mr. Urmach, as you sit here today, I mean, are we missing a lot of your communications with the President?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But you don’t think we’re missing any material conversations that you have with the President?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Or with Rudy Giuliani.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Are there any other key fact witnesses that would help us, you know, get to the bottom of whether there was any link to the aid and the-
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now the aid was ultimately lifted on September 11th correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And Senator Johnson in his letter on page six quotes the President on August 31st, “Ron, I understand your position. We’re reviewing it now and you’ll probably like my final decision.” So even on August 31st and this is before any congressional investigation started, the President was signaling to Senator Johnson that he was going to lift the aid.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And most of the other witnesses we talked to, whether it’s from the Department of Defense or OMB or you know, have told us that all along during this 55 day period, they genuinely believed the hold would be lifted. What was that your feeling too at the time?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Now what do you know about the Ukrainians knowledge of the hold?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I mean during your deposition you testified that you did not believe the Ukrainians were aware of the hold until the Politico article.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We have testimony from several witnesses that the President was concerned about foreign aid generally. And so he had an appetite to put holds on aid because he was trying to be a good steward of US tax payer dollars. Do you agree with that?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And are you aware that he was also interested in better understanding the contributions of our European allies?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And there was some back and forth between the state department officials trying to better understand that information for the President.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And how do you know that wasn’t the reason for the hold?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But yet you speculate that there was, you know, a link to this announcement?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. I want to turn quickly to the July 10th meeting, the July 10th meeting in Ambassador Bolton’s office involving Ambassador Volker, Mr. [Dunnie Luk 00:15:57], Mr. Yara Mark has been the subject of some controversy. Ambassador Volker yesterday testified that it wasn’t until the end of the meeting, Mr. Dunnie Luk said it was going through some real detailed information about some of the plans he had, but it wasn’t until the end of the meeting, Ambassador Volker recollects that you mentioned something general about investigations. What do you remember from that meeting?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And nobody accused you at that point in time of being involved with some sort of drug deal?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Did Dr. Hill ever relate to you her concerns about you being involved in a drug deal?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So you were surprised when testimony emerged that she thought there was a drug deal going on?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And in fact after the meeting you went out and you took a picture, right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Then did you retire to the ward room?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	There was no mention of Vice President Biden in the ward room?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Or any specific investigation?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When again, did the Vice President Biden nexus come to your attention?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And to the best of your knowledge, you never understood that anyone was asking Ukrainians to investigate US persons, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And just to sort of be clear here, ultimately the aid was lifted on September 11th. There was never any announcement by the Ukrainians about any investigations they were going to do, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The Ukrainians never, to your knowledge, started any of these investigations, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And consequently, these allegations that there was a quid pro quo that had to be enforced before the aid is released, that never came to fruition, right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I want to just step back a little bit and just verify with you that the President had some deep rooted concerns about corruption in Ukraine, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And you believed him, right? Given his business dealings in the region?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And when you first started discussing the concerns the President had with corruption, Burisma wasn’t the only company that was mentioned right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But other companies came up, didn’t they?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	At one point in your deposition, I believe you said yeah, NAFTA gas comes up at every conversation. Is that fair?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. You had, I guess Dr. Hill at one point, attributed to you the terminology that the President has given you a large remit. You familiar with her assertion of that?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But you have and we got into this a little bit in your deposition, you know, you said that the President gave you a special assignment with regard to Ukraine, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. When we asked you that at the deposition, you said I was spinning a little bit.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, and you further testified, so when I said the President gave me an assignment, it wasn’t really the President, it was the secretary through the President and that’s where I received my direction. Correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Did Ambassador Taylor ever bring any concerns to your attention about the so called channel he dubbed the irregular?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you maintained an open line with him, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. We had tried to count them up. There’s 215 or something, text messages between you Volker and ambassador Taylor, you know, during the early August timeframe. Does that make sense to you?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And he never communicated any concerns to you during this timeframe that he had issues with what was going on?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	This request for some sort of investigation.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ultimately you put a period on that issue by having the September 9th communication with the President, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And when you shared that feedback with ambassador Taylor, was he satisfied that this issue is now behind them?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	At one point in your text she said, let’s get on the phone. Right. And you said you’re an individual that doesn’t like to walk through these issues on text when you can talk about it on the telephone, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And did you talk with Ambassador Taylor?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And just getting back to the irregular channel, did anyone else express any concerns to you about this so called irregular channel?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And so the concerns, you know, raised were never brought to a head?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When you talk in your statement about in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe, it was your speculation, it was your guess that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of 2016. I believe you said that at this point you believed everyone knew this. Is that correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But you had no evidence to prove that, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You stated that you haven’t been able to access your records, is that correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But you’ve also stated that you don’t take notes. Right?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You freely admit that you, I asked you your deposition, we put together a list of all the times you said you don’t recall. It’s like two pages long.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So, you know, you don’t on a lot of these questions, I mean there’s nuance, there are ambiguities and we don’t have records, we don’t have notes and we don’t have recollections, correct?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I mean, what we’re trying to get to the facts here, we’re trying to find out what actually happened, what’s reliable, what’s accurate. Bill Taylor kept notes. He brought a little notebook in his pocket at his deposition and he held it up and he says, when I’m not at my desk and I’m on the phone, I use this notebook. When I’m at my desk, I use a notebook. George Kent said he wrote just innumerable memos to the file. Catherine Croft, she testified that she didn’t believe George Kent’s notes would be accurate. And so, you know, we have all this, you know, back and forth, but you know as we get to the end here, you don’t have records. You don’t have your notes because you didn’t take notes. You don’t have a lot of recollections. I mean, this is the like the trifecta of unreliability isn’t that true?
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But a lot of it’s speculation, a lot of it is your guess and we’re talking about an impeachment of the President United States. So the evidence here ought to be pretty darn good.
2019-11-20	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, thank you sir.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Good afternoon, welcome back from lunch. Hope you had some sandwiches or something delicious.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Dr. Hill, thank you for your service. Also thank you for your participation in the deposition on October 14th, Columbus day. We were with you most of the day, so I appreciate that. Mr. Holmes, thank you as well. You?re a late entrant into this situation and things sure did escalate quickly. We spoke with you last Friday night about what we thought was going to be a 30 second vignette about a two minute phone call. And it turns out with your 40 minute opener today, you have a lot of information to share. So we appreciate you being here. Dr. Hill, your last day at the National Security Council was July 19th, is that correct?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So you weren?t involved with the July 25th call and you weren?t involved with any of the relevant activities related to the pause in the aid?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And as of July 19th, did you believe that a call was going to be scheduled for the 25th?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And what was the thinking at the NSC as of July 19th about such a call?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, were you in favor-
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And where are you in favor of such a call as of the 19th?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And how about Ambassador Bolton to your knowledge?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you know what his opposition was?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And were you surprised that a call ultimately was scheduled?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you have any communications with anyone back at your old staff with about how that came to be?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. You did learn about the pause in the security assistance aid-
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And there were several meetings about this, I believe you testified to.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And is it fair to say that stops and starts in aid like this sometimes do happen?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And I believe you had testified that there was a freeze put on all kinds of aid and assistance because it was in the process, at that time there were significant reviews of foreign assistance going on.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And what else can you tell us about that?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And at this time as well, Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sondland, they had become a little bit more involved with Ukraine policy?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	What can you tell us about Ambassador Volker?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, and you said he?s a man of integrity?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And always acted in the best interests of the United States.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When did you first learn of Ambassador Sondland?s involvement?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Did you have any concerns when he presented himself to you as somebody with a major role?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you express any concerns to him directly?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	What were those concerns?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Did that surprise you when he told you that?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right. I believe you used the term, ?a large remit,? that he characterized. He had been given ?a large remit? from the President.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right. We asked Ambassador Sondland about that at his deposition and he conceded that he may have been spinning a little bit when he said that the President specifically gave him that role and he indicated that his authority was coming at least a little bit more from the Secretary of State. At any point in time, was that relayed to you?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Were you encouraged, as of your last day in the office, that U.S. policy towards the Ukraine was headed in the right direction?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And why was that?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, I was concerned about two things in particular. One was again, the removal of our ambassador, and again, I will say for the record that the President has a perfect right to remove any ambassador at any time for any reason. But I was very concerned about the circumstances in which her reputation had been maligned repeatedly on television and in all kinds of exchanges. I felt that that was completely unnecessary. If the President wanted to remove an ambassador, which he did quite frequently, there was a number of ambassadors removed, who were not political but career officials that was done, but without these kinds of interventions. I wondered what that message was being sent. So there was that.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And then on the second front, it was very clear at this point that there was, let?s just say a different channel in operation and relations to Ukraine. One that was domestic and political in nature, and it was very different from the channel or the loop, however you like it, that I and my colleagues were in, where we were focused on bilateral relations and the U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine. And these two things had diverged at this point
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the run up to Ambassador Yovanovich?s separation from post, did you have any communications with officials at the State Department about your concerns?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And who did you relate those concerns to?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And you advocated to all those officials about your concerns about the information being spread about Ambassador Yovanovitch?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The Trump administration changed courses from its predecessor and provided lethal defensive assistance to the Ukraine. Were you in favor of arming the Ukrainians with the javelins?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And you?re in fact, one of the, I believe the only witness that we?ve spoken to that has been able to articulate the opposition to providing the javelins. And as we understand it during the Obama administration, the interagency consensus was in fact to provide the javelins but they were not provided. Are you aware of the decision back then?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Mr. Holmes, you?re on the ground in Kiev and the javelins have now been authorized, provided. What?s the view from the field, the U.S. embassy as to the effectiveness of the javelins?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Ambassador Taylor has testified, Mr. Kent has testified that this is in fact the consensus of the inner agency of providing the javelins. In your experience of working with Ambassador Taylor, was he also very much an advocate for this?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you have something?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I want to turn to President?s Zelensky?s inauguration. Ambassador Volker testified that he was very pleased with the size of the delegation, although the Vice President was unable to make the trip. Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland. And I understand Dr. Hill, you were involved with some of the logistics and putting the delegation together.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	What can you tell us about the Vice President?s role in attending or not attending?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right. The President was traveling in Japan and then he was headed to Europe for the D-Day anniversary. The Vice President?s office, according to Ms. Williams, provided four days. The end of end of May, the 29th, 30th, 31st, June 1st. And as it turned out the Ukrainians decided, I believe it was on May 16th to schedule the inauguration for four days later. And by this point in time the the Vice President had been rerouted for a trip to Canada about the USMCA. And I just want to ask you, you don?t have any evidence that the Vice President was encouraged not to attend for any other reason, do you?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Ms. Williams testimony was that she just heard from the chief of staff?s assistant that the Vice President one was not able to go. The leap, that the reason for that was related to any of these investigations hasn?t been fully established. I want to just note from the materials you provided for your deposition, there was a discussion whether President Orban may have influenced President Trump?s decision on that May 13th day. Do you remember when the meeting was with President Orban?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When was that?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So do you remember what time of day it was on the 13th?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Jennifer Williams testified that she learned about 11:00 AM or 11:15 AM, the meeting with President Orban was not scheduled until later in the afternoon. According to your schedule, it was right around 1:45 PM, is that consistent with your recollection?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. All right. Overall, given the four days notice, given Secretary Perry?s involvement, do you think that delegation was a good sized group?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Secretary Perry had become interested in some of the energy related issues in the Ukraine, is that correct?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And what can you tell us about his involvement in some of the Ukrainian policy?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mr. Holmes, what was your view of the delegation? Do you think it was the right sized group, a right level of prestige to signal to the incoming Zelensky administration that the U.S. stands behind them?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. [inaudible 00:25:55].
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Dr. Hill, you told us during your deposition that indeed that there are perceived conflict of interest troubles when the child of a government official is involved with something that that government official has a official policy role in, correct?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And back to Ambassador Sondland, you testified that every now and then he made a habit of name dropping his interactions with the President?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And I believe you also had told us that there were instances where you would run into him on the campus and he would say, ?Oh, I?m here to see the President, or I?ve been in to see the President.? And you had an occasion to circle back and found out that wasn?t the case.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And I just want to give you an opportunity, he testified about some sort of coffee he had with you on your last day and I think when the deposition transcript was released, your counsel indicated that that was completely fabricated on Ambassador Sondland?s part. And I just want to give you an opportunity to address that.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And he went on to indicate that you were upset and you were upset with-
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Fair enough. He indicated you were upset and you were upset with Ambassador Bolton and upset with the way things are going. And I believe your counsel said that was an outright fabrication.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Just for sake of the timeline, I think as of July 19th, they hadn?t even engaged with Rudy Giuliani yet. I don?t believe that happened until a little bit later. So you believe by July 19th, they were already engaged in those types of activities?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And there?s some, I mean, there?s some ambiguity in the direction to work with Rudy Giuliani. Ambassador Volker said, the president dismissed Ukraine and said, oh, if you want to work on it, just go talk to Rudy. And Ambassador Sondland took that a little bit differently. And I believe that Ambassador Volker was primarily the interlocutor with Mr. Giuliani and that was happening. It didn?t start until the end of July.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mr. Morrison, told us both in his deposition and at his public hearing that you had related concerns about Colonel Vindman?s judgment?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Colonel Vindman related to us during his deposition that he subsequently was sort of cut out of a lot of the decision making and involvements with the embassy in Ukraine. Was that something you recommended?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Mr. Holmes, at the end of August, we understand that Ambassador Taylor was engaged in obtaining some information for the president about European allies burden sharing in the region as the decision about aid was being debated.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you were able to communicate that information back at the end of August?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And do you think that was the information the White House was looking for?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And the aid was subsequently lifted, the pause in the aid was lifted shortly thereafter?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, both of you, for your testimony today. I first want to say, because I think it shouldn?t go unmentioned, that the characterization just a few minutes ago by one of my Republican colleagues of this proceeding I think is vile, irresponsible, and dangerous. I want to remind us why we?re here. Because somebody in government, a whistleblower felt that it was important enough to get other people in government?s attention that the President may have committed a wrong act. We have now heard and seen substantial evidence that the President in fact tried to trade a political favor for official government resources. The most damning words come from no one else but the President himself on that phone call with the Ukrainian president where he asked for a favor, he mentions investigations, he mentioned the Bidens and Burisma. However, as Mr. Holmes just testified, Mr. Holmes also overheard the President speaking to his hand-picked ambassador, Ambassador Sondland, about investigations.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mr. Holmes has also said that in the office, everybody knew, or many people knew at least, that the president wanted an investigation of the Bidens. In addition, although Mick Mulvaney and Rudy Giuliani have not come before this committee, Mick Mulvaney and Rudy Giuliani have spoken publicly on the issue investigations. Mick Mulvaney, the president?s chief of staff, the person who usually works with a president the most, day in and day out, went in front of the White House press corps and basically admitted that an investigation had something to do with holding up the aid and admitted that this process was politicized.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Rudy Giuliani, the president?s personal lawyer, also essentially admitted that these investigations were at issue. He said that he thinks he did nothing wrong because he was working at the direction of the president. So we have seen substantial evidence and heard substantial evidence of wrongdoing by the President of the United States, and this Congress will have to continue to take up this very important issue to the American people.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	My concern today is also I feel as though the cancer of wrongdoing may have spread beyond the President and into others of the executive branch. And I want to ask you a few questions about that. Before I do, I?d like, Chairman, to enter two articles into the record if I could. One of them is headline, ?After boost from Perry, backers got huge gas deal in Ukraine.? The other one is titled, ?Wall Street Journal, Federal prosecutors probe Giuliani?s links to Ukrainian energy projects.
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mr. Holmes ? Thank you, chairman. You indicated that Secretary Perry, when when he was in the Ukraine, had private meetings with Ukrainians. Before he had those private meetings in a meeting with others, including yourself, I believe, he had presented a list of American advisors for the Ukraine energy sector. Do you know who was on that list?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you know if Alex Cranberg and Michael Bleyzer were on that list?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Was it before Secretary Perry did this? We also heard in testimony before that Ambassador Sondland also had a private meeting with somebody. How unusual was it before these guys showed up for folks, diplomats so to speak, or U.S. government officials, to have private meetings where they insist that nobody else be in the room?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And I want to ask you also about the precedent that we set, both of you. I know you?re here as fact witnesses, but you?re also public servants for this country. The precedent that this Congress would set, putting aside Donald Trump for a second, if the Congress allows a President of the United States now or later to ask a-
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Dates now or later to ask a foreign government, head of state, to investigate a political rival. What precedent does that set for American diplomacy, for the safety of Americans overseas, and for the future of our country?
2019-11-21	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Thank you both. I yield back, Chairman.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Morning, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, members of the Committee and members of the staff. My name is Steve Castor. I’m a congressional staff member. I serve with the Oversight Committee on the Republican staff with Mr. Jordan. I’m also, for purposes of this investigation, I’m a shared staffer with the Judiciary Committee and Mr. Collins and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Mr. Nunez. It sure is atypical for a staffer to be presenting, but again, thanks for having me.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The purpose of this hearing, as we understand it, is to discuss whether President Donald J Trump’s conduct fits the definition of a high crime and misdemeanor. It does not, such that the Committee should consider articles of impeachment to remove the president from office and it should not. This case, in many respects, comes down to eight lines in a call transcript. Let me say clearly and unequivocally that the answer to that question is no.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The record in the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry does not show that President Trump abused the power of his office or obstructed Congress. To impeach a president, who 63 million people voted for, over eight lines in a call transcript is baloney.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Democrats seek to impeach President Trump not because they have evidence of high crimes or misdemeanors, but because they disagree with his policies. This impeachment inquiry is not the organic outgrowth of serious misconduct. Democrats have been searching for a set of facts in which to impeach President Trump since his inauguration on January 20th, 2017. Just 27 minutes after the president’s inauguration that day, the Washington Post ran a story that the campaign to impeach the president has already begun. The article reported Democrats and liberal activists are mounting broad opposition to stymieing Trump’s agenda, and noted that impeachment strategists believed the Constitution’s emoluments clause would be the vehicle.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the first two years of the administration, Democrats in the House introduced articles of impeachment to remove President Trump from office on several very different factual bases. On January 3rd, the very first day of the new Congress, Congressman Sherman introduced articles of impeachment against the president. The same day Representative Tlaib said, “We’re going to go in there. We’re going to impeach the president.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In May 2019, Representative Green said on MSNBC, “If we don’t impeach this president, he will be reelected.” Even Speaker Pelosi, who has said that impeachment is a somber and prayerful exercise, has called President Trump an impostor and said it is dangerous to allow voters to judge his performance in 2020.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The obsession with impeaching the president is reflected in House Democrats, have used the power of their majority in the past 11 months. In the Oversight Committee, the Democrats’ first announced witness was Michael Cohen, a disgraced felon who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. When he came before us at the Oversight Committee, he then lied again as many as eight times. Oversight Committee Democrats demanded information about the president’s personal finances and even subpoenaed the president’s accounting firm, Mazar, for large swaths of sensitive and personal financial information about the entire Trump Family. The subpoena was issued over the objection of Committee Republicans and without a vote.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the Ways and Means Committee, Democrats demanded the president’s personal tax return information. The reason they cited for wanting the president’s tax returns, they said was to oversee the IRS’s audit process for presidential tax returns. You can judge that for yourself.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the Financial Services Committee, Democrats demanded and subpoenaed the president’s bank records, going back 10 years. The Financial Services Committee Staff, the Republicans tell me the information demanded would cover every withdrawal, credit card swipe, or debit card purchase of every member of the Trump Family, including his minor child. The reason that the Democrats gave for why they needed such voluminous and intrusive personal information about the Trump Family was, get this, financial industry compliance with banking statutes and regulations.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Here in the Judiciary Committee, Democrats sent out letters demanding information from over 80 recipients, including the president’s children, business partners, employees, his campaign, businesses, and foundation. Of course the main event for the Judiciary Committee was the report of Special Counsel Mueller, which Democrats would believe would serve as the evidentiary basis for impeaching the president.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Despite interviewing 500 witnesses, issuing 2,800 subpoenas, executing almost 500 search warrants, and spending $25 million, the Special Counsel’s 19 attorneys and 40 FBI agents, analysts, and staff found no conspiracy or coordination between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	After the Trump/Russia collusion allegations did not pan out, Democrats focused their efforts on obstruction of justice. They criticized the Attorney General Bar for concluding that no crime of obstruction had occurred in the Special Counsel Investigation, but in fact was entirely appropriate for the Attorney General to make that call, because the Special Counsel declined to do so. Not surprisingly, the Democrats’ Mueller hearing was underwhelming to say the least. And the sequel with Corey Lewandowski definitely did not move the impeachment needle either.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The Intelligence Committee, too, is heavily invested in the Russia Collusion Investigation. Committee Democrats hired former federal prosecutors to prepare for their anticipated efforts to impeach the president. Now that the Russian collusion allegations did not work out, Democrats have settled on the Ukraine phone call, eight lines the president uttered on July 25th with Ukrainian President Zelensky.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But the Foreign Affairs Committee, the committee of jurisdiction wasn’t the committee leading the impeachment inquiry or holding the hearings. Neither was the Oversight Committee, the House’s chief investigative entity. The Judiciary Committee was only recently brought back into the mix after fact finding concluded.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Instead, the impeachment inquiry was run by the House Intelligence Committee and these former federal prosecutors. Democrats on the Intelligence Committee ran the impeachment inquiry in a manifestly unfair way. All the fact finding was unclassified and that was made clear at the top of every single deposition, but the Democrats took advantage of the closed door process in the Capitol basement bunker, the skiff, to control access to information.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The secrecy effectively weaponized the investigation, allowing misleading public narratives to form and catch hold with careful leaks of witness testimony. Democrats refused to invite Republican witnesses and directed witnesses called by the Democrats not to answer our questions.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the public hearings, many of these unfair processes continued. Democrats refused to invite numerous witnesses requested by Republicans, interrupted Republican questioning and prevented witnesses from answering Republican questions. Democrats voted down, by virtue of a motion to table, with no notice, subpoenas for documents and testimony requested by Republicans. I’ll note that Democrats never once brought any of their subpoenas to a vote before the Intelligence Committee.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	This unfair process reflects the degree to which Democrats are obsessed with impeaching the president. The Democrats went searching for a set of facts on which to impeach the president. The emoluments clause, the president’s business and financial records, the Mueller Report, allegations of obstruction, before landing on the Ukraine phone call.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The impeachment inquiry is clearly an orchestrated effort to upend our political system. According to Politico, the speaker has tightly scripted every step of the impeachment inquiry. Democrats have reportedly convened focus groups to test which allegations, whether it be quid pro quo or bribery or extortion, were most compelling to the American Public.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Speaker Pelosi said, “Democrats must strike while the iron is hot on impeaching the president.” The entire duration of the impeachment inquiry, from the time Speaker Pelosi announced it on September 24th until today, has been 76 days. As Professor Turley testified last Wednesday, this impeachment would stand out among modern impeachments as the shortest proceeding with the thinnest evidentiary record and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The artificial and arbitrary political deadline by which Democrats are determined to finish impeachment by Christmas leads to a rush process and missed opportunities to obtain relevant information. Democrats avoided the accommodations process required by federal courts and disputes between Congress and the executive. Democrats declined to attempt to negotiate with the administration for the production of documents and witnesses. Democrats did not exhaust all their options to entice witnesses or agencies to cooperate, such as allowing witnesses to appear with agency lawyers or initiating contempt proceedings. Sometimes the threat of a contempt proceeding gets you a different result. Sometimes the witnesses choose to appear when contempt is on the table.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Democrats even withdrew a subpoena to one witness who asked a federal court to resolve conflicting orders from Congress and the executive, either because the Democrats did not want to wait for the court to rule or they didn’t like the presiding judge, Judge Leon. Instead, Democrats made their demands and refused to budge. Democrats told witnesses at the outset that their refusal to cooperate in full would be used against them and the president. Democrats threatened federal employees that their salaries could be withheld for not meeting committee demands. These tactics are fundamentally unfair and counterproductive for gathering information in any serious inquiry.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	This rushed and take it or leave it approach to investigating is contrary to how successful congressional investigations typically work. Congressional investigations take time. There is no easy button. In this job, you must take the information that’s offered even if you don’t like the terms. You should not say no to taking a witness’s testimony because you would prefer the agency counsel is not present. If that’s the only means of obtaining the testimony, you should take it. Your priority must not be on blocking information out. It must be on seeking information.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	"In all recent major congressional investigations, for example, Chairman Goodlatte and Gowdy’s investigation into the Justice Department’s decision during 2016, the IRS targeting investigation, the Bengazi investigation, and Fast and Furious, there have been give and take between Congress and the executive. In the Goodlatte/Gowdy investigation, for example, it took two months; two months of negotiations before the committees conducted the first witness interview with Deputy Director McCabe. The Justice Department only began producing documents to the Committee after many more months of discussions. In none of these investigations did Congress get everything it wanted right at the beginning, certainly not within 60 or 76 days. But with persistence and patience, we eventually did receive enough information to do our work."
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And contrary to talking points, the Trump Administration has in fact cooperated with and facilitated congressional oversight and investigations. For example, earlier this year, the Oversight Committee conducted an investigation into security clearances at the White House. The central allegation put forward was that the White House deviated from established procedures to grant clearances to certain White House staff. The Democrats sought to interview career staff who perform these security clearance reviews, but declined the witness initially to appear with agency counsel.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The House and the White House were at an impasse. However, after a little bit of time, we, the Republican staff with the help of Mr. Jordan, convinced the witness to appear with agency counsel for our own transcribed interview. And the Democrats came along. The subsequent interviews in the security clearance investigation were conducted with agency counsel. The testimony allowed the committee to obtain the evidence to get to the bottom of what was going on and it wasn’t what was alleged. Nobody outside the security clearance office was handing out clearances, certainly not to senior White House staffers.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In this impeachment inquiry however, Democrats have turned away information that could be valuable to the inquiry by disallowing agency counsel to accompany witnesses. Democrats have turned away information by declining to negotiate in good faith with the administration about the scope of document requests. As a result of these failures, the evidentiary record and the impeachment inquiry is incomplete, and in many places incoherent.The failure to exhaust all avenues to obtain information severely risks undermining the legitimacy of any articles of impeachment.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	As professor Turley said to the committee last week, “I’m concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger. I believe this impeachment not only fails the standard of past impeachments, but would create a dangerous precedent for future impeachments.” Professor Turley elaborated that the current lack of proof is another reason why the abbreviated investigation into this matter is so damaging for the case of impeachment.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The substantive case for impeaching President Trump as a result of an artificial arbitrary and political schedule relies heavily on ambiguous facts, presumptions, and speculation. President Turley warned here too that impeachments have been based on proof, not presumptions. The Democrats do not have the proof.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Now, my Democrat counterparts on the Intelligence Committee are talented attorneys. I’m sure they will tell you a riveting story about a shadow or irregular foreign policy apparatus and a smear campaign designed to extort Ukraine for the president’s political benefit. They’ll tell you about President Trump and how he put his own political interests ahead of national security by mentioning former Vice President Joe Biden by name and raising the allegations of Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election on the July 25th call. They’ll try to convince you that the Trump Administration, the same administration Democrats regularly accused of being incompetent, orchestrated an international conspiracy at the highest levels.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	None of this adds up. It may be a great screenplay, but it’s not what the evidence shows. The Democrats’ impeachment inquiry ignores all of the evidence that does not advance their story. The Democrats’ impeachment narrative resolves all ambiguous facts and conflicting evidence in a way that is most unflattering to the president. The Democrats’ impeachment narrative ignores public statements from senior Ukrainian officials that contradict the narrative.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	As you listen to the Democrat presentation later today, I urge you to keep these points in mind. What evidence that has been gathered in the impeachment inquiry paints a different picture? I won’t provide a detailed presentation now, but allow me to highlight a few points. First, the summary of the July 25th phone call reflects no conditionality or pressure. President Zelensky never vocalized any discomfort or pressure on the call. Contrary to Democrat allegations, President Trump was not asking for a favor that would help his reelection. He was asking for assistance in helping our country move forward from the divisiveness of the Russia collusion investigation.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Second, since President Trump has declassified and publicly released the call summary 75 days ago, President Zelensky has said publicly and repeatedly that he felt no pressure. He said it on September 25th at the United Nations General Assembly. He said it in an interview published on October 6th. He said it again on October 10th. And most recently, he said it just last week in Time Magazine. Other senior Ukrainian officials have also said there was no linkage between a meeting, security assistance, and an investigation. If President Trump was truly orchestrating a pressure campaign to force Ukraine to investigate former Vice president Biden, one would think that Ukraine would have felt some pressure.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Third, at the time of the July 25th call, senior officials in Kiev did not know that the security assistance was paused. They did not learn it was paused until the pause was reported publicly in the U.S. media on August 28th. As Ambassador Volker testified, because the highest levels of the Ukrainian government did not know about the pause, there was no leverage implied.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Finally, President Zelensky met with President Trump in New York on September 25th at the United Nations. Shortly thereafter, or shortly before that, the security assistance flowed to Ukraine. Both happened without Ukraine ever taking actions or investigations. The impeachment record also has substantial evidence going to the president’s state of mind, undercutting the Democrats assertion of some malicious intent. Witnesses testified that president Trump has a deeply rooted, genuine, and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine, stemming from its history of corruption. President Trump is skeptical of U.S. taxpayer funded foreign assistance and believes that our allies should share more of the burden of Ukraine’s defense.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ukrainian politicians openly spoke out against President Trump during the 2016 election. These events bear directly on the president’s state of mind. President Zelensky had run on an anti-corruption platform, but he was an untried politician with a relationship to a controversial Ukrainian oligarch. When Vice President Pence met with Presidents Zelensky in Warsaw on September 1, he stressed to him the need for reform and reiterated the president’s concern about burden sharing, especially among European allies.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In late August and early September, after his party took control of the Ukrainian Parliament, Ukraine passed historic reforms to fight corruption. These reforms, including removing parliamentary immunity, which witnesses said had been a historic source of corruption. Imagine if members of our Congress had immunity. President Trump later lifted the pause on security assistance and met with presidents Zelensky two weeks later. The aid was paused for 55 days.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Very simply, the evidence in the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry does not support the conclusion that President Trump abused his power for his own personal political benefit. There is simply no clear evidence that President Trump acted with malicious intent, in withholding a meeting, or security assistance. Indeed there are, and the Republican report articulates them, legitimate explanations for these actions that are not nefarious, as the Democrats allege.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The evidence shows that President Trump faithfully executed the duties of his office by delivering on what he promised the American voters he would do. Democrats may disagree with the president’s policy decisions or the matter in which he governs, but those disagreements are not enough to justify the irrevocable action of removing him from office. The Democrats hyperbole and histrionics are no good reason, 11 months out from an election, to prevent the American People from deciding on their own who is going to be the next president.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	This record also does not support a conclusion that President Trump obstructed Congress during the impeachment inquiry for many of the procedural defects I touched on earlier. Additionally, as a factual matter, the only direct testimony the investigation has obtained about the president’s reaction to the inquiry is from Ambassador Sondland, who testified President Trump told him to cooperate and tell the truth. President Trump has also declassified and released the summaries of his two phone calls with President Zelensky. President Trump has said that he would like witnesses to testify, but he’s been forced to resist the unfair and abusive process.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I believe strongly in the prerogatives of the Congress. It’s awful to hear President Turley’s testimony from last week when he critiqued the House for proceeding on impeachment so rapidly and on such a thin record. Professor Turley said, “To set this abbreviated schedule, demand documents, and then impeach because they haven’t been turned over when they go to court, I think is an abuse of power.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	“The Impeachment of a duly elected president,” as Chairman Nadler said in 1998, “is the undoing of a national election.” Now, I understand Democrats’ issue to report over the weekend, arguing that contrary to the Chairman’s statement in the 1998 Impeachment is not undoing an election. I would just respond by saying that I don’t think many of the 63 million Americans from all around the country who voted for President Trump in 2016 would agree. By impeaching President Trump, the House would essentially be nullifying the decision of those Americans, and the House would be doing it in less than 11 months before the next election.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	There still is no compelling argument for why Democrats in the House must take this decision out of the hands of the voters and do it before Christmas. During the Clinton Impeachment in 1998, the Chairman said that at bare minimum, the president’s accusers must go beyond hearsay and innuendo and beyond the demands that the president prove his innocence of vague and changing charges. I would submit that those words ring as true today as the Chairman believed them to be in 1998.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The impeachment record is heavily reliant on hearsay, innuendo, and presumptions. Democrats have lobbed vague and ever changing charges for impeachment, going as far back as the president’s inauguration. For all these reasons, the extraordinary exercise of the House’s impeachment authority is not warranted on the evidentiary record presented.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Thank you for allowing me to present this information this morning, and I yield back.  Democratic Counsel Daniel Goldman Opening Statement
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Afternoon, chairman, ranking member Collins, members of the committee, members of the staff. Thank you again for having me back and giving me the opportunity to testify about the evidence gathered during our impeachment inquiry. At the outset, let me say that the evidence does not support the allegations that my Democrat colleagues have made. I don’t believe the evidence leads to the conclusions they suggest. I’m hopeful to add some important perspective and context to the facts under discussion today.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The chief allegation that the Democrat’s impeachment inquiry has been trying to assess over the last 76 days is this: Whether President Trump abused the power of his office through a quid pro quo bribery, extortion or whatever, by withholding a meeting or security assistance as a way of pressuring Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate the president’s political rival, former VP Biden, for the president’s political benefit in the upcoming election.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The secondary allegation that has been levied is whether President Trump obstructed Congress during the inquiry. The evidence obtained during the inquiry does not support either of those allegations. The Republican report of evidence lays out the reasons in more detail, but I will summarize. I will begin with the substantive allegation about an abuse of power. The inquiry has returned no direct evidence that President Trump withheld a meeting or security assistance in order to pressure President Zelensky to investigate former VP Biden. Witnesses who testified in the inquiry have denied having awareness of criminal activity or even an impeachable offense. On the key question of the President’s state of mind, there is no clear evidence that President Trump acted with malicious intent.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Overall at best, the impeachment inquiry record is riddled with hearsay, presumptions, and speculation. There are conflicting and ambiguous facts throughout the record. Facts that could be interpreted in different ways. To paraphrase Professor Turley from last week, the impeachment record is heavy on presumptions and empty on proof. That’s not me saying that, that is Professor Turley.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Let me start with the best direct evidence of any potential quid pro quo or impeachable scheme. This is President Trump’s phone call with Zelensky for which the National Security Council and the White House Situation Room staff prepared a call summary. According to testimony from Tim Morrison at the NSC, the summary was accurate and complete. NSC staff member Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Veneman testified that any omissions in the summary were not significant and that editing was not done maliciously. President Trump has declassified and released the call summary so the American people can review it and assess it for themselves.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I’ll make a few points that seem to have gone under noticed. The call summary reflects absolutely no pressure or conditionality. President Zelensky vocalized no concerns with the subject matters discussed, and there is no indication of bribery, extortion, or other illegal conduct on the call. The call summary shows President Trump and President Zelensky engaged in pleasantries and cordialities. The call summary reveals laughter. Simply put, the call is not the sinister mob shakedown that some Democrats have described. President Trump raised his concerns about European allies paying their fair share and security assistance to Ukraine, a concern that President Trump would continue to raise both publicly and privately. There is no discussion on the call, I repeat no discussion on the call, about the upcoming 2020 election or security sectors assistance to Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Beyond the call summary, the next best piece of evidence are the statements from the two participants on the call. President Zelensky has said he felt no pressure on the call. On September 25th at the United Nations, he said, “We had I think a good phone call. It was normal. Nobody pushed me.” On October 6th President Zelensky said, “I was never pressured and there were no conditions being imposed.” Four days later on October 10th, President Zelensky said again, “There’s nothing wrong with the call. No blackmail. This is not corruption. It was just a call.” Just recently in Time Magazine, President Zelensky said, “I never talked to the president from a position of a quid pro quo.” Because President Zelensky would be the target of any alleged quid pro quo scheme, his statements denying any pressure carry significant weight. He is in fact the supposed victim here.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Other senior Ukrainian government officials confirmed President Zelensky’s statements. Foreign minister Prystaiko said on September 21st, ” I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.” Oleksandr Danylyuk, who was then secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Counsel told Ambassador Bill Taylor on the night of the call that the Ukrainian government was not disturbed by anything on the call. President Trump, of course, has also said that he did not pressure President Zelensky. On September 25th, President Trump said there was no pressure when asked if he wanted President Zelensky to do more to investigate the former VP, President Trump responded, “No, I want him to do whatever he can. Whatever he he can do in terms of corruption, because corruption is massive. That’s what he should do.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Several witnesses attested to the president’s concerns about Ukrainian corruption. The initial readouts of the July 25th call from both the Ukrainian government and the state department raised no concerns. Although Lieutenant Colonel Veneman noted concerns, those concerns were not shared by National Security Council leadership. They were not shared by General Keith Kellogg who listened on the call. Lieutenant General Kellogg said in a statement, “I heard nothing wrong or improper on the call. I had and have no concerns.” Lieutenant Colonel Veneman superior, Tim Morrison, testified that he was concerned the call would leak and be misused in Washington’s political process, but he did not believe that anything discussed on the call was illegal or improper.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Much has also been made about President Trump’s reference on the July 25th call to Hunter Biden’s position on the board of Burisma, a corrupt Ukrainian energy company and the actions of certain Ukrainian officials in the run up to the 2016 election. Democrats dismissed these conspiracy theories to suggest that the president has no legitimate reason other than his own political interests to raise these issues with President Zelensky. The evidence, however, shows that there are legitimate questions about both issues. With respect to Burisma, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified that the company had a reputation for corruption. The company was founded by Mykola Zlochevsky who served as Ukraine’s Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources. When Zlochevsky served in that role, his company Burisma received oil exploration licenses without public auctions. Burisma brought Hunter Biden onto its board of directors, according to the New York Times, as part of a broad effort by Burisma to bring in well-connected Democrats during a period when the company was facing investigations backed not just by domestic Ukrainian forces, but by officials in the Obama administration. George can’t testify about these efforts. Hunter Biden reportedly received between $50,000 and $83,000 a month as compensation for his position on Burisma’s board. At the time that Hunter Biden joined the board, his father, the former VP, was the Obama administration’s point person for Ukraine. Biden has no specific corporate governance expertise and we don’t believe he speaks Ukrainian or Russian. We don’t believe he moved there. So he’s getting this gigantic paycheck for what? The Washington Post wrote at the time of Biden’s appointment to Burisma’s board that it looked nepotistic at best and the Washington Post said, The Washington Post, “Nefarious at worst.” According to the Wall Street Journal, anti-corruption activists in Ukraine also raised concerns that the former VP’s son received money from Zlochevsky and worried that that would mean Zlochevsky would be protected and not prosecuted.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Witnesses in the impeachment inquiry noted Hunter Biden’s role on the board and how it presented at minimum a conflict of interest. Lieutenant Colonel Veneman testified that Hunter Biden did not appear qualified to serve on Burisma’s board. Witnesses testified that Hunter Biden’s role on the board was a legitimate concern to raise. In fact, George can’t explain that in 2015, he raised a concern to the office of former Vice President Biden at Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board presented a potential conflict of interest. However, Hunter Biden’s role did not change and former Vice President Biden continued to lead US policy in Ukraine. On this record, there is a legitimate basis for President Trump to have concern about Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The prospect that some senior Ukrainian officials worked against President Trump in the run up to the 2016 election draws an even more visceral reaction from most Democrats. Let me say very, very clearly that election interference is not binary. I’m not saying that it was Ukraine and not Russia. I am saying that both countries can work to influence an election. A systemic coordinated Russian interference effort does not mean that some Ukrainian officials, some Ukrainian officials, did not work to oppose President Trump’s candidacy, did not make statements against President Trump during the election. Ambassador Volker testified in his public hearing that it is possible for more than one country to seek influence in US elections. Dr. Hill testified likewise at her public hearing.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Contemporaneous news articles in 2016 noted how President Trump’s candidacy led Kiev’s wider political leadership to do something they would never have attempted before intervene, however indirectly, in a US election. In August, 2016 the Ukrainian ambassador to the US published an oped in the Hill criticizing candidate Trump. Other senior Ukrainian officials called candidate Trump a clown and other words. They alleged that he challenged the very values of the free world. One prominent Ukrainian parliamentarian explained that the majority of Ukraine’s political figures were on Hillary Clinton’s side. A January 2017 Politico article lays out in more detail efforts by the Ukrainian government officials to oppose President Trump’s candidacy. The article notes how Ukraine work to sabotage the Trump campaign by publicly questioning his fitness for office. The article detailed how a woman named Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American contractor paid by the DNC and working with the DNC and the Clinton campaign, traded information and leads about the Trump campaign with the staff at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington. Chalupa explained how the Ukrainian embassy worked directly with reporters to point them in the right direction. Witnesses in the impeachment inquiry testified that the allegation of Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election was appropriate to examine. Ambassador Volker testified that he thought it was fine to investigate allegations about 2016 influence. Ambassador Taylor said, for example, that the allegations surprised and disappointed him. On this record, I do not believe that one could conclude that President Trump had no legitimate basis to raise a concern about efforts by Ukrainians to influence the 2016 election.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Let me now turn to the first assertion that President Trump withheld a meeting with President Zelensky as a way of pressuring him to investigate the former VP. Here it is important to note Ukraine’s long profound history of endemic corruption. Several witnesses in the inquiry have testified about these problems. Ambassador Marie Evanovich, for example, said Ukraine’s corruption is not just prevalent, but frankly is the system. Witnesses testified to having firsthand knowledge that President Trump is deeply skeptical of Ukraine due to its corruption dating back years, and that this skepticism contributed to President Trump’s initial hesitancy to meet with President Zelensky. Ambassador Volker testified, so I know he had a very deep rooted skeptical view and my understanding at the time was that even though he agreed in the meeting that we had with him and say, okay, “I’ll invite him, I’ll invite him.” “He didn’t really want to do it,” Volker said, “and that’s why the meeting kept getting delayed.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Another relevant set of facts here is the effort of some Ukrainian officials to approach President Trump’s candidacy in the 2016 election. Some of these Ukrainian politicians initially remained in government when President Zelensky took over. Witnesses testified that these Ukrainian efforts in 2016 colored how President Trump viewed Ukraine. It’s also important to note that President Zelensky was a relatively unknown quantity for US policymakers. Ambassador Evanovich called him an untried politician. Dr. Hill testified that there were concerns within the National Security Council about Zelensky’s relationship with Igor Kolomoisky, a controversial oligarch in Ukraine. Although President Zelensky ran on a reform platform, President Zelensky appointed Kolomoisky’s lawyer, Mr. Bogdan as his chief of staff. Both ambassador Volker and Senator Ron Johnson noted that this appointment raised concerns. These facts are important in assessing the president’s state of mind and understanding whether President Zelensky was truly committed to fighting corruption in Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The evidence shows the President Trump invited President Zelensky to meet at the White House on three separate occasions, all without any conditions. The first was on April 21st during the initial congratulatory phone call. The second was via letter on May 29th. This letter followed an Oval Office meeting on May 23rd with the US Delegation to the inauguration. During this meeting, President Trump again expressed his skepticism about Ukraine. Ambassador Volker recalled the president saying, “These are terrible people and a corrupt country.” Ambassadors Sondland similarly testified that Ukraine, in the president’s view, tried to take them down in the 2016 election. Senator Ron Johnson confirmed this testimony in his submission to the impeachment inquiry.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Finally the third time that President Trump invited Zelensky to meet, again without any preconditions, was during the July 25th phone call. Although sometime time passed between May 2019 when the president formally invited Zelensky to meet and September 25th when the presidents met, the evidence does not show that the Ukrainian government felt additional pressure due to this delay. To the contrary, Ambassador Volker testified that the Ukrainian regime felt pretty good about its relationship with the Trump administration in this period. During those four months, senior Ukrainian government officials had at least nine meetings or phone calls with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Secretary Pompeo, National Security Advisor Bolton and US ambassadors.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The evidence does not support a conclusion that President Trump conditioned to meeting with President Zelensky on investigating former Vice President Biden. Mr. Yermak, President Zelensky’s close advisor, said that explicitly in an August, 2019 New York Times story which was published before the beginning of the impeachment inquiry. In this article, Yermak said that he and Mayor Giuliani did not discuss a link between a presidential meeting and investigations. Witness testimony confirms Yermak’s statement. Ambassador Volker testified there was no linkage between a potential meeting and investigations. Although Ambassador Sondland testified that he believed there was a quid pro quo, his testimony is not as clear as it has been portrayed. In his deposition, Ambassador Sondland testified that he believed the meeting was conditioned on a public anti corruption statement, not on investigations themselves. A distinction that during his deposition he was keen to note, Ambassador Sondland said then that nothing about the request raised any red flags. In his public testimony, Ambassador Sondland clarified that he had no firsthand knowledge of any linkage coming from the president and never discussed any preconditions with the president. He merely presumed there were preconditions. I’d also like to address the July 10th meeting and Ambassador Bolton’s office with two senior Ukrainian officials. Allow me to submit that here too there is conflicting evidence about the facts. Both Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Veneman testified that Ambassador Sondland raised investigations during this meeting causing Ambassador Bolton to abruptly end the meeting. Dr. Hill testified she confronted Ambassador Sondland over his discussion about investigations. Ambassador Sondland’s testimony about this meeting however, is scattered. In his closed door deposition, he testified that no National Security staff member ever once expressed concerns to him that he was acting improperly. He denied that he raised investigations during this meeting. But when he came here to testify in public, he acknowledged for the first time that he raised investigations, but he denied that the meeting ended abruptly. He maintained that Dr. Hill never raised concerns to him and that any discussion of investigations did not mention anything specific such as Biden or 2016.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Let me lastly address the allegation that President Trump directed Vice President Pence not to attend President Zelensky’s inauguration as another way of pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. Jennifer Williams, a senior advisor in the office of the Vice President, testified that a colleague, she said it was the Chief of Staff’s assistant, told her, the Chief of Staff’s assistant, that President Trump had directed Vice President Pence not to attend the inauguration. However, Williams had no firsthand knowledge of any such direction or the reasons given for any such direction. If indeed such a direction was given, it’s not clear from the evidence why it was done because the Vice President’s office was juggling other potential trips during that time and the Ukrainian parliament scheduled the election on an extremely short timeframe. It was just four days notice. Williams explained that there was a window, there was a window of dates May 30th through June 1st during which the Vice President could attend the inauguration, and that was communicated. And that if it wasn’t one of those dates, it would be difficult or impossible to attend the inauguration.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Separately, the office of the Vice President was also planning an unrelated trip to Canada to promote the USMCA during the same window. The USMCA was and still is a significant priority for the administration. Vice President Pence has done a number of public events in support of it. President Trump was also planning foreign travel during this time period. As Dr. Hill testified, both President Trump and Vice President Pence cannot both be out of the country at the same time. Williams explained that these factors created a narrow window for the Vice President’s participation in the inauguration.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Dr. Hill testified that she had no knowledge that the Vice President was directed not to attend. On May 16th, the outgoing Ukrainian parliament scheduled the inauguration for May 20th, only four days later. May 20th was not one of the three dates that Vice President Pence’s office had provided for his availability. Williams testified that, “This early date surprised the Vice President’s office because we weren’t expecting the Ukrainians to look at that time frame.” George Kent at the state department said that, “This short notice from the Ukrainians forced the state department to scramble to find a US official to lead the delegation.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Finally, settling on Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry. On May 20th, the date of President Zelensky’s inauguration, Vice President Pence was in Jacksonville, Florida for an event promoting USMCA. Finally on September 25th, President Trump and President Zelensky met during the United Nations General Assembly. The two met without Ukraine ever taking action on investigations and according to Ambassador Taylor, there was no discussion of investigations during this meeting.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I will now turn to the second assertion that President Trump withheld taxpayer funded security assistance to Ukraine as a way of pressuring Zelensky to conduct these investigations. Here too context is critically important. President Trump has been skeptical of foreign assistance in general and believes quite strongly that our European allies should share more of the burden for regional defense. That’s an assertion he made the campaign trail. It’s something he’s raised consistently since. It’s also important to note that US security assistance is conditioned to countries around the world and that USAID, including aid to Ukraine, has been temporarily paused in the past for various reasons and even for no reason at all. Ambassador Volker testified the 55 day pause on security assistance did not strike him as uncommon and that the pause was not significant. Dr. Hill and state department official, Catherine Croft both testified that security assistance to Ukraine specifically had been temporarily paused in the past.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In fact, Ambassador David Hale, under Secretary of State for political affairs, the third most senior person at the state department, testified that the National Security Council had launched a review of US foreign assistance across the world to make sure taxpayer dollars were spent in the national interest and to advance the principle of burden sharing by our allies. Dr. Hill testified that as she was leaving the NSC in July, there had been a directive for a whole scale review of our foreign policy assistance. She said, “There had been more scrutiny on security assistance as a result.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Another important data point is President Trump’s willingness to take a stronger stance in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression compared to the previous administration. Several witnesses testified the President Trump’s willingness to provide Ukraine with lethal defensive assistance, javelin anti-tank missiles was a substantial improvement, a stronger policy, and a significant decision. When we discuss Democrat allegations that President Trump withheld vital security assistant dollars from Ukraine, we should also remember that it was President Trump and not President Obama who provided Ukraine with lethal defensive weapons.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I make all of these points here because there are relevant pieces of information that bear on how the House should view the evidence in question. Although the security assistance was paused in July, the evidence is virtually silent on the definitive reason for the pause. In fact, the only direct evidence of the reason for the pause comes from OMB official Mark Sandy, who testified that he-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	For the pause, comes from OMB official, Mark Sandy, who testified that he learned in September that the pause was related to the president’s concern about other countries contributing more to Ukraine. He explained how OMB received requests for information on what other countries were contributing to Ukraine, which OMB provided in the first week of September. The aid, of course, was released September 11th. Several witnesses have testified that security assistance was not linked to Ukraine’s investigations. Ambassador Volker’s testimony is particularly relevant on this point, because he was a key intermediary with Ukrainian government, and someone who they trusted and sought for advice. Ambassador Volker testified that he was aware of no quid pro quo, and the Ukrainians never raised such concerns to him. When Ambassador Taylor raised the possibility of a quid pro quo to Ambassador Volker, Volker said he replied, “There’s no linkage here.” During his deposition, Chairman Schiff tried to pin him down on this point, but Ambassador Volker was clear, there was no connection.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In his public testimony. Ambassador Volker reiterated there was no linkage. Similarly, George Kent at the State Department said he did not associate aid to investigations, and he relayed how Ambassador Taylor told him that Tim Morrison and Ambassador Sondland also believed the two were not linked. Ambassador Sondland’s testimony, as we have seen already, is a bit more scattered. In his deposition, he said that he was never aware of preconditions on security assistance, or that the security assistance was tied to investigations. Ambassador Sondland then later provided a written statement, supplementing his deposition, in which he explained for the first time, that in the absence of any clear explanation, he presumed a link between security assistance and anti-corruption statement were linked. Ambassador Sondland also tested in his written supplement that he likely voiced this concern to Mr. Yermak, a close advisor of President Zelensky on September 1st in Warsaw.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mr. Yermak, however, in a subsequent news account published on November 22nd, disputed Ambassadors Sondland’s account, and said he doesn’t remember any reference to the military aid. In his public testimony, Ambassador Sondland reiterated that his testimony was based on a presumption, acknowledging to Congressman Turner, that no one on the planet told him that security assistance to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations. Ambassador Taylor is the other relevant actor here. He testified in his deposition that he had a clear understanding that Ukraine would not receive security assistance until President Zelensky committed to the investigations. However, in his public testimony, Ambassador Taylor acknowledged that his clear understanding came from Ambassador Sondland, who was merely presuming that there was a link. President Trump, too, rejected any linkage between security assistance to Ukraine and investigations. The president’s statements in this regard, ought to be persuasive, because he made the same statement in two separate private conversations with two different U.S. officials 10 days apart.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	There would be no reason for the president to be anything less than candid during these private conversations. On August 31st, President Trump spoke by phone with Senator Johnson, who was traveling to Ukraine in the coming days, and sought the president’s permission to tell President Zelensky that the security assistance would be forthcoming. President Trump responded that he was not ready to do that, citing Ukrainian corruption and burden sharing among European allies. When Senator Johnson raised the potential linkage between security assistance and investigation, President Trump vehemently denied any connection, saying, “No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?” In closing the call, President Trump told Senator Johnson that we’re reviewing it now, referring to this security assistance. “And guess what? You’ll probably like my final decision.” He told that to Senator Johnson on August 31st. This statement strongly suggests that President Trump was already leaning toward lifting the aid. Separately, on September 9th, President Trump spoke by phone with Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador Sondland asked the president, “What do you want from Ukraine?” President Trump responded, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In addition, senior Ukrainian government officials denied any awareness of a linkage between U.S. security assistance and investigations. These denials are persuasive because if there was, in fact, an orchestrated scheme to pressure Ukraine by withholding security assistance, one would think the pause on security assistance would have been clearly communicated to the Ukrainians. Foreign Minister Prystaiko told the media in November, following news of Ambassador Sondland’s written supplemental testimony, that Sondland never linked security assistance to investigations. Prystaiko said, “I have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance.” Although there is some testimony that Ukrainian officials from the embassy in Washington, made informal inquiries to the State Department and Defense Department about these issues with security assistance in July and August, the evidence does not show President Zelensky or his senior advisors in Kiev, were aware of the pause, until it was publicly reported by Politico on August 28th.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	A subsequent news article explained the conflicting testimony that embassy officials in Washington had made informal inquiries about issues with the aid, while senior officials Kiev denied awareness of the pause. The article explained that then Ukrainian Ambassador Chaly, who was appointed by President Zelensky’s predecessor, went rogue, and did not inform President Zelensky that there was any issue with the aid. According to the news account, President Zelensky and his senior team only learned of a pause when it was reported on August 28th. As Ambassador Volker testified, because senior Ukrainian officials were unaware of the pause, there was no leverage implied. The actions of senior Ukrainian government officials while the security assistance was paused, reinforces a conclusion that they did not know the aide was on hold. In the 55 days during which the security assistance was paused, President Zelensky had five discussions with U.S. senior officials. On the July 25th, he spoke with President Trump on the phone.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	July 26th he met with Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Sondland in Kiev. On August 27th, he met with Ambassador Bolton. September 1st, he met with Vice President Pence in Warsaw, and on September 5th, he met with Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Chris Murphy in Kiev. In none of these meetings, did President Zelensky raise any concern about linkage between security assistance and investigations. In particular, the September 5th meeting with Senator Johnson and Senator Murphy is notable because they’re not part of the Trump Administration, and President Zelensky could be candid with them. What did occur during those 55 days, were historic efforts by Ukraine’s parliament called the Rada to implement anticorruption reform.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	“Vice President Pence had pressed President Zelensky about these reforms during their September 1st meeting. In their depositions, Ambassador Taylor lauded President Zelesky’s rapid reforms and National Security Council Official Morrison testified that during a meeting in Kiev, they noted that everyone on the Ukrainian side of the table was exhausted because they’d been up all night working on these reforms. On September 11th, President Trump discussed the matter with Vice President Pence, Senator Portman, and acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney. According to Tim Morrison’s testimony, they discussed whether Ukraine’s progress on anticorruption reform was enough to justify releasing the security assistance. Morrison testified that Vice President Pence was obviously armed with the conversation he had with President Zelensky, and they convinced the president that the aid should be dispersed immediately. The president then lifted the hold. And concluding this point, we have considerable evidence that President Trump was skeptical of Ukraine due to its corruption. We have evidence the president was skeptical of foreign assistance, in general, and that he believes strongly our allies should share the burden for regional defense.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We know the white house was reviewing foreign assistance, in general, to ensure it furthered U.S. interests, and that OMB research provided information about which foreign countries were contributing money to Ukraine. President Trump told Senator Johnson on August 31st, “We’re reviewing it now, and you’ll probably like my final decision.” He told Ambassador Sondland on September 9th, “I want Zelensky to do what he ran on.” President Zelensky, who ran on an anti-corruption platform, was an untried politician with ties to a potential controversial oligarch. Vice President Pence reiterated President Zelensky, that on September 1st, the need for reform was paramount. After President Zelensky passed historic anti-corruption reforms, the pause on security assistance was lifted, and the presidents met two weeks later. The Ukrainian government never took any action on investigations at issue in the impeachment inquiry. Much has been made about a so-called shadow, or irregular foreign policy apparatus, that President Trump is alleged to have orchestrated as a mechanism to force Ukraine to initiate investigations. The allegation is President Trump conspired to recall Ambassador Yovanovitch from Ukraine, so his agents could pursue a scheme to pressure Ukraine to conduct these investigations, but there are logical flaws with these arguments. First, every ambassador interviewed in the impeachment inquiry, acknowledged the president has an absolute right to recall ambassadors for any reason or no reason. It’s apparent that President Trump lost confidence in Ambassador Yovanovitch, and it’s simply not an abuse of power for him to recall her. Beyond that, the Trump Administration replaced Ambassador Yovanovitch with Ambassador Bill Taylor, who became one of the first State Department officials to voice concerns discussed during the course of our inquiry here. In fact, Ambassador Taylor played a prominent role in some of the hearings last month. If President Trump truly sought to remove Ambassador Yovanovitch as part of a nefarious plan, he certainly would not have replaced her with someone of the likes of Ambassador Bill Taylor.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Second, the three U.S. officials who comprise the so called shadow foreign policy apparatus, Ambassador Volker, Sondland, and Secretary Perry can hardly be called irregular, and certainly not outlandish. All were senior U.S. officials with official interest in Ukraine policy. The three kept the State Department and the NSC informed of their activities. Finally, there is evidence that Mayor Giuliani did not speak on behalf of the president. According to a news story on November 22nd, Mr. Yermak asked Ambassador Volker to connect him with Mayor Giuliani because the Zelensky team was surprised by the mayor’s negative comments about Ukraine. They wanted to change his mind. Both Ambassador Volker, in his deposition, and Yermak in an August New York times article, denied that Mayor Giuliani was speaking on behalf of President Trump as his agent. Instead, as Ambassador Volker explained, the Ukrainian government saw Giuliani as a conduit through which they could change the president’s mind.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The second allegation at issue, of course, is whether the president obstructed Congress by not agreeing to all the demands for documents and testimony. As somebody with experience with congressional investigations and I strongly believe in Congress’s article one authority, but this impeachment inquiry is departed drastically from past bipartisan precedents for presidential impeachment, as well as the fundamental tenants of fair and effective congressional oversight. First, process matters. The bipartisan Rodino-Hyde precedents guaranteed fundamental fairness and due process to the president. It allowed substantive minority participation and participation from the president’s council in the fact finding process. Neither aspect was present in here. Democrats denied us witnesses. Democrats voted down subpoenas we sought to issue for both documents and testimony, and I’ll note Democrats never brought to a committee vote any of the subpoenas that were issued. They were all tabled. Democrats direct the witnesses not to answer our questions, and these sorts of actions de-legitimized the inquiry, and do not give the witnesses or the president confidence that the inquiry is fair.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Second, the president or any potential witness to this impeachment inquiry should be allowed to raise defenses without it being used as an adverse inference against him. Courts have held that The Constitution mandates an accommodations process between the branches. For this reason, congressional oversight is a time-intensive endeavor. It certainly takes longer than 76 days. Here, however, the initial letters from the Democrats instructed potential witnesses that if they did not cooperate in full, it shall constitute evidence of obstruction. Democrats wanted all their demands honored immediately, and were unwilling to consider the executive branch’s privileges or defenses.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Finally, there is no basis for obstruction. The one witness who said he spoke to President Trump about his appearance as a witness, Ambassador Sondland, testified the president told him to cooperate and tell the truth. The president has declassified and released the call summary of his July 25th and April 21st calls with President Zelensky. The White House wrote to Speaker Pelosi to say that it was willing to cooperate further if the House returned to a well-established, bipartisan, Constitutional-based impeachment process. As we know, these protections were never afforded. In closing, I’d like to briefly address the Democrats’ narrative as articulated in their report. The Democrat narrative virtually ignores any evidence that’s not helpful for their case. It ignores, for instance, that Ambassador Sondland’s testimony that he presented, that there was a quid pro quo, and it ignores the many public statements made by Ukrainian officials.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The report presents a story as if the evidence is clear, when in reality, it’s anything but. Democrats have gone to great lengths to gather information to build their case, and they’ve even obtained and released phone records relating to the communications of the president’s personal attorney, a reporter, and a member of Congress. There are additional phone records that have not yet been released, and our members remain concerned about the prospect of more phone records being released. There have been a lot of hyperbole and a lot of hysteria over the last three months about this inquiry and the underlying facts. I believe a lot of this can be traced back to the anonymous whistleblower complaint. I believe the whistleblower reframed a lot of the facts at issue, and caused witnesses in the inquiry to recast their views. And it’s unfortunate that we haven’t been able to interview the whistleblower.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Finally, some have likened the impeachment inquiry to a special prosecutor’s investigation. If one accepts that comparison, one should also expect that, like Ken Starr and Robert Mueller, the chairman should testify. And our members, all the committees believe very strongly that Chairman Schiff should testify and answer questions. With that, Mr. Chairman, the time is yours.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Point of order.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think the evidence that we talked about show-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right, like the call he had with Senator Johnson.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I wouldn’t agree with that.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s too early.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t know what President Trump believed or didn’t believe, but it’s too early.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I didn’t look at Twitter. I try to stay off Twitter lately.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I didn’t look at those tweets.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	President Trump goes to a lot of rallies, he does a lot of tweeting. I think it’s pretty difficult to draw too many conclusions from his tweets or his statements at rallies.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I mean, he’s obviously running for reelection. What does the date he announced his intent to run for reelection matter?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s been related to me. I don’t know when Vice President Biden indicated he was going to run, as I sit here today.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, nobody-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, I slightly disagree with the premise of your question, because we’re talking about-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Let’s get back to the fact that we’re talking about eight ambiguous lines in a call transcript. The president was not asking for a personal favor. He was speaking on behalf of the American people. He said, and I’ll read it, “I’d like you to find out what happened with the whole situation in Ukraine. They say CrowdStrike, I guess you have one of your wealthy people-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It says the other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	There’s a video of the former VP. I think that’s what the president’s referring to. He was at the council on foreign relations, and the former VP was a little bit audacious in how he describes, he went over to the-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It says.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It says the other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s what it says here, yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s what it says. And then he says it sounds horrible to me.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t think the record supports that.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t think it supports that. I think it’s ambiguous.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, I mean, are you talking about the call transcript?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In general?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You’re saying that the schemer-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	… would talk about his scheme?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He definitely did not talk about 2020.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	President Trump has done a lot for the Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think what happened is the president saw this video of the former VP and I think it coalesced in his mind.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t know that he did or he didn’t. I mean, that is not something that we’ve looked at.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No, but I have no evidence he did not. I mean, this video is pretty remarkable.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes, sir.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He did.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He did. He was.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s absolutely correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes, sir.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Of course.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Of course.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Of course.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Of course.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Some of them, but I also indicated that some of these, the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, I think, have revised their views after the call transcript came out and the whistle blower complaint was released.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No, I didn’t say that.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I didn’t say that. You know what, the question about Jennifer Williams is interesting is-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	She never mentioned anything to her supervisor. She never mentioned anything to anybody in the Vice President’s office en route to Warsaw when the Vice President was going to meet with President Zelensky, she didn’t even raise it as a potential issue that might catch the Vice President off guard.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So her concern that she articulated during the course of the deposition and during the course of the hearing was incongruent, incongruent, with the facts and what she did during times relevant.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right. Nobody in America knew about Jennifer Williams’ concerns until she walked in the door for her deposition.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	She said it was unusual.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, I mean, she was here for nine hours in the bunker, so she said a lot about the call.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I didn’t say and nothing more.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right but it doesn’t say and nothing more.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It wasn’t a block quote. She felt it was unusual. She didn’t raise the concerns to Lt. Gen. Kellogg.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t have an issue with the way we described Ms. Williams’ testimony.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ms. Williams-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	If you’re telling me I did, I mean, I don’t know as I sit here right now if that’s in the report.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Her views of the call differ remarkably from Mr. Morrison, also from Lt. Gen. Kellogg’s.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I didn’t misquote her.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We certainly didn’t misquote her.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I mean, we described what Ms. Williams said. She said it was inappropriate.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yep.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I’ve got to clear a couple things up here, though. I’ve got to clear a couple things up here, if I may.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	First of all, Morrison didn’t think-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I mean-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The question was concerned about leaks.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And by the way Volker never meant-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	All right.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Oh my goodness. That is absolutely right.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Absolutely the Trump administration has participated in oversight during the entire Congress until it got to this impeachment inquiry.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Because the terms are just not fair.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Robert Blair… I’m glad you-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think he was allowed to come if agency counsel-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think he would have come with agency counsel.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He would have provided testimony, I think, if agency counsel could have come. I mean, it’s really expensive to hire these outside lawyers.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Eisenberg presents another set of-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Eisenberg is… He may have been able to come with agency counsel, but he presents some complexities. I mean, he’s the chief legal advisor for Ambassador Bolton.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He may have been able to come with agency counsel, but his testimony does present complexities.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think you’re reading a little too much into some of the eight lines. I don’t think the President was requesting an investigation into Joe Biden. He just mentions an offhand comment-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, but you’re presuming that then at some point it became US policy to investigate Joe Biden and I don’t think that’s the case.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	May I add something there?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	President Trump did mention-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	There’s some very bad people there.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Come on, Barry, in fairness here, President Trump talks about very bad people.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yep.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He did.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, Ukrainians knew that-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Rudy had the President’s ear.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He referred them to Rudy, yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s right. In fact, I mean the Ukrainians are the ones that first… President Zelensky is the one who first brings up Mr. Giuliani on the call.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ambassador Volker testified though that Mr. Giuliani had a negative impression of Ukraine and that he was possibly fueling the President’s views, and so there was some discussions about hey, if you can convince Rudy that President Zelensky is a true reformer, the real deal, that that would be a beneficial link.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, I mean, the record is somewhat spotty with Giuliani. I know that the New York Times reported in May but Ambassador Volker gave a pretty detailed account of his meeting in July 19th.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Are we going to talk about the breakfast with Volker?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t know what Giuliani was talking about but I guess you’re right. The-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So we’re going to sidestep the Volker meeting on July 19th?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Giuliani was doing some things in… out here. And, then, he became involved with the official channel. With Volker, with Sondland. And, at that meeting on July 19th, Volker counseled against the perspective Giuliani was taking.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	September 9th. September 9th.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I have some information on the subpoenas.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We did receive copies of the subpoenas. And, we tracked this. There were six, as I understand it. And, let me just say at the outset. Our members have concerns about this exercise for three reasons.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The subpoenas yielded information about members of Congress. Whether they were subpoenaed, the members phone records or not. It’s a concern when the information yields member of Congress’ phone records. And, then, the information is publicized.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Second is with journalists. It’s just generally a very tricky area to start investigating journalists’ call records. And, the third is with regard to Mr. Giuliani who was serving as the president’s personal attorney. But, there’s six subpoenas, as we understand it. The first went to AT&T for the Giuliani numbers. The second was in regard to Igor Fruman. To a company, CSC Holdings. The third related to Mr. Sondland. That was off to Verizon. The fourth was back to AT&T. Seeking information on a certain number. The fifth was back to AT&T. And, the sixth was seeking subscriber information. Which, impacted the veteran journalist John Solomon. And, also, involved with these are some of the attorneys involved such as-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s Tunsing and just diGenova.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, it’s obvious they were trying to figure something out.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ms. Cowan, if I may. I’m so sorry.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I have a number of things I think I need to clear up. If I may.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And, you have to bear with me. Because, I have a number of them here. First of all, on the call. Tim Morrison, general Kellogg, have a totally different view of the call than Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Jennifer Williams.going to the point that the call is ambiguous. So, that’s the first thing. Tim Morrison testified that he went to the national security council lawyers for a very different reason. He did not say he went to the NSC lawyers because he was concerned about the call. He went to the national security council lawyers for two reasons. Number one, they weren’t on the call. So, we wanted to update them about it. But number two, he was concerned about.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	… we wanted to update them about it, but number two, he was concerned about leaks, and he was concerned that if his call leaked out how it would play in Washington’s polarized environment, which is exactly what we have here. He was also concerned that if the call leaked that it might affect bipartisan support in Congress. You know, the issues of Ukraine have traditionally been one of the few issues where Republicans and Democrats share interests. And the third reason was that he didn’t want the Ukrainians to get a distorted perception of what actually happened on the call. Because on the call, and we’re talking about eight lines of concern and a lot of ambiguity.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	This oval office meeting on May 23rd there’s this question, I guess it’s ambiguous, I didn’t think it was ambiguous, but there’s a question about whether when the president referred the delegation goes to the inauguration May 20th. They come back, it’s silent, it’s Volker and it’s secretary Perry and it’s Senator Johnson and they’re briefing the president and the president is having none of it. He says Ukraine is concerned, or corrupt and he doesn’t want to invite Zelensky to the white house. And the president, and Volker testifies to this pretty definitively, the president, essentially, he doesn’t order anybody to do anything. The president says talk to Verde and Volker testified both at his deposition and at the public hearing that he didn’t take it as a direction. It’s just like, look, if you, if you guys think this is important and you want to work it, just go talk to Rudy. It’s very different than a direction. It’s very different than the president ordering a scheme and it’s very different from the president sort of collecting up a bunch of agents to go do something because he simply, according to ambassador Volker said, go talk to Rudy.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Now, whether the Ukrainians knew of the aid pause, or the aid was paused for 55 days,
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Whether the Ukrainians knew about it or not, has been, Laura Cooper from DOD and some state department witnesses testified about light queries that they had perceived. There was an article on November 22nd in Bloomberg, and the Zelensky administration said they never knew about the hold in the aid until August 28th political article. And they said in the article, and Yermak is the principle person they’re relying on here, Yermak says that they believe the embassy was keeping information from them. Another interesting thing Mr, Yermak says in that November 22nd Bloomberg article, is that he recounts the whole aside meeting with Sondland, which has become very significant apparently. And the pull aside meeting, he says he doesn’t recall it the way ambassador Sondland recalled it. Now keep in mind, Mr. Yermak speaks English, but it’s not his first language. And so he does not recall the pull aside meeting, which by the way happened on the way to an escalator after the meeting with the vice president. So he recalls it very differently. So the question and the facts of what happened between ambassador Sondland and Mr. Yermak on the way to the escalator remain in dispute.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Now turning attention to the Ron Johnson letter, if I may?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	On August 31st… Senator Johnson is getting ready to travel to Ukraine on September 5th with Senator Murphy, and Johnson wanted the aid released, so he calls the president. He actually sought permission to be the bearer of good news.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	President said, I’m not ready to lift the aid, and they had this, Senator Johnson, I mean he writes a 10 page letter, very detailed, and he gives them some remarkable detail and I’d like to read it. It’s on page six. This is Senator Johnson speaking. He said, “I asked him whether there was some kind of arrangement where Ukraine would take some action and the hold would be lifted. Without hesitation,” senator Johnson says, “President Trump immediately denied such an arrangement existed, and he started cursing and he said, no way. President Trump said, no way. I would never do that. Who told you that?” And Senator Johnson goes on to say that president Trump’s reaction here was adamant, vehement and angry. Senator Johnson goes on to say that as of August 31st the president told them, but you’re going to like my decision in the end. So I think that’s very important context on what the president’s state of mind was at least as of August 31st.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Absolutely.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	My wife thanks you as well. She likes it when I do the talking when she’s not around.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s right. And with the highest integrity.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Across the board, all the witnesses, including ambassador Evanovich, talked about integrity that ambassador Volker brings to the table.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He is deeply skeptical of sending US tax payer dollars into an environment that is corrupt because it’s as good as kissing it goodbye.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	This is something that he has ran on. It’s something that he has implemented policies as soon as he became president. And ambassador Hale, the third ranking state department official told us about the overall review of all foreign aid programs and he described it as almost a zero based evaluation.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Sandy was one of the few witnesses that we had that was able to give us firsthand account inside of OMB the reason for the pause related to the president’s concern about European burden, urban sharing in the region.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, I mean, Senator Johnson was, and president Trump were pretty candid, and they believe that allies like Germany were laughing at us because we were so willing to spend the aid.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, he’s said it consistently. He said it in the United nations September 25th, he said it in three more news availabilities over the course of the period, including last week.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And professor Turley, by the way, he’s no Trump supporter.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The worst thing you can have with an impeachment is partisan rank Corps, because nobody’s going to accept the result on the other side.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think that goes to whether this constitutes bribery. There’s case law on bribery, and I’m no Supreme court scholar, lawyer, advocate, but you know, there’s new case law with the McDonald case about what constitutes an official act. And that certainly hasn’t been addressed in this space. And I think professor Turley mentioned that.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think it’s the McDonald case goes to that.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, we were barred from asking him questions about who he communicated his concerns to.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And I would say, too, this rapid, we’re in day 76 and it’s almost impossible to do a sophisticated congressional investigation that quickly, especially when the stakes are this high. Because any congressional investigation of any consequence it does take a little bit of time for the two sides to stake out their interests and how they’re going to respond to them.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We learned with the [inaudible 02:09:55] Gowdy probe. The first letter I think went in October of 2017, and in December we finally got a witness and it was the following spring with getting the [inaudible 02:10:09] Gowdy probe, after a lot of pushing and pulling and a lot of tug of war, we reached a deal with DOJ where we went down to DOJ and they gave us access to documents and they gave us access to, I think, north of 800,000 pages. But they made us come down there, they made us go into a skiff and these documents weren’t classified and it wasn’t until May and June of that year that we started this process when the investigation had been ongoing and that is disappointing. Obviously we all wish there was an easy button, but congressional investigations of consequence take time.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, I mean fast and furious, we issued subpoenas. Mr. Issa sent some subpoenas I think in February of 2011, and we had a hearing in June with experts about proceedings and contempt, what does it take to go to contempt, and that that was the first time in June when we got any production and the production was largely publicly available information. And we spent most of the year trying to get information out of the justice department. At the time we were also working with whistle blowers who were providing us documents and chairman Issa at the time, then in October, issued another subpoena that was to the justice department and so the investigation had been ongoing most of the year we were talking to whistle blowers. We’re doing interviews and we’re doing our best to get documents out of the justice department through that channel. But these things take time.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Certainly not 76 days.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	There’s a number of ways to enforce the request. I mean, the fundamental rule of any congressional investigation is you rarely get what you’re asking for unless, and until the alternative is less palatable for the respondent. So you issue a subpoena, and you’re trying to get documents, one technique you can use to try to talk to a document custodian or somebody in the ledge affairs function about what documents exist. Chairman Chaffetz, during his era, used to have these document production status hearings where you bring in ledge affairs officials and try to get the lay of the land because alleged affairs officials at least nominally are supposed to be directly responsible serving the interest. You can saber rattle, legal to saber rattle about holding somebody in contempt. Oftentimes witnesses who are reluctant to cooperate and come forward when you attach a contempt, proceeding or a prospective contempt proceeding to their name, a lot of times that changes the outcome and with a contempt proceeding you’ve got a couple of different steps along the way.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You could raise the prospect of a contempt proceeding, you could schedule a contempt proceeding. After you schedule a contempt proceeding, you could hold the door open for documents or interviews and then you could push it off. You could go through at the committee level and these are all sort of milestone events which historically are unpalatable or less palatable for the administration that sometimes starts to move the needle. And with these types of disputes, once you get the ball rolling, you know it’s a [good luck 00:18:36] Gowdy probe.,We didn’t get a witness and it was deputy director Andrew McCabe for, it was a couple of months. But once we got deputy director McCabe in, a couple of weeks later we got a director Colome’s chief of staff, a couple of weeks later… I mean the witnesses start, once you get the ball rolling you… Again, you don’t always like 100% of the terms. Sometimes you got to deal with agency counsel, sometimes you got to go look in camera. But once you get the ball rolling, usually it leads to positive results, and historically has allowed the Congress to do its work.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well one of the concerning things is Dr. Kupperman, who has been described by Dr. Fiona Hill and a number of witnesses as a solid citizen, a good witness. He filed a lawsuit in the face of a subpoena and a judge was assigned to a judge Leon and the issues, the [Coverman raise 00:20:01] were slightly different than the Don McGahn issues. Because you know, Don McGahn is the personal, or the white house counsel. Kupperman of course is a national security official. Kupperman filed the lawsuit seeking guidance, Kupperman wasn’t asking the court to tell him not to come testify. To the contrary, Kupperman was seeking the court’s guidance to facilitate his cooperation and, ultimately the committee with withdrew the subpoena, which raises questions about whether the committee’s really interested in getting to the bottom of some of these issues.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Tell you what I did on this point I, yesterday, I opened the Democrat report and I did a control F.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You know, control F?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Sondland’s name shows up I think 611 times. And in fairness, it’s going to be double counted because if it’s in a sentence and then it’s in a footnote that’s two. But in relative comparison to the other witnesses, Sondland’s relied on big time.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The record is mixed on this front. Dr. Hill talks about raising concerns with Sondland, and Sondland in his deposition at least doesn’t, he didn’t share the same view.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Sondland as a witness, he’s a bit of an enigma, let’s just say it that way. He was pretty certain in his deposition that the security assistance wasn’t linked to anything, and then he submitted an addendum.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And even in that addendum or supplement or whatever it’s called, it’s talk to him and her and anyway, Sondland ends with, “I presumed.” So it wasn’t really any firsthand information.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	On certain facts we don’t. We have firsthand information on the May 23rd meeting in the oval office. We’ve got a lot of firsthand information, although all conflicting, on the July 10th meeting. There are episodes, I think, during the course of this investigation, that we have been able to at least get everyone’s account. But the investigation hasn’t been able to reveal firsthand evidence relating to the president other than the call transcript.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You know, it started with his role with the Ukraine portfolio. A lot of people at the state department were wondering why the ambassador to the EU was so engaged in issues relating to the Ukraine. And there are answers for that. Ukraine is an aspirant to join the EU, and there’s a lot of other reasons. And Mr. Turner I think explored this really well at the open hearing, but we asked Ambassador Sondland, and he said he did a TV interview in Kiev on the 26th of July where he said, the president’s given me a lot of assignments and he’s the president to assign me Ukraine and so forth. But then when we asked him in his deposition, he conceded that he was in fact spinning, that the president never assigned him to Ukraine, that he was just, he said he was exaggerating.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Let’s say it this way. You know, ambassador Taylor walked us through his standard operating procedure for taking notes. He told us about having a notebook on his desk and a notebook in his coat pocket of his suit and he brought it with us and he showed us. So consequently when ambassador Taylor recounts to us what happened, it’s backed up by these contemporaneous notes. Ambassador Sondland on the other hand, was very clear that… Firsthand, he said that he did not have access to state department records. While he said that at the public hearing, simultaneously the state department issued a tweet I think, or a statement at least saying that wasn’t true, that nobody is keeping ambassador Sondland from his emails. You know, he’s still a state department employee, he can go, he does have access to his records, but he stated he didn’t, and he stated that he doesn’t have any notes because he doesn’t take notes. And he conceded that he doesn’t have recollections on a lot of these issues. And we made a list of them and I think at the hearing I called it the trifecta of unreliability.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah. Tim Morrison talked about instances where ambassador Sondland was sort of showing up on invited. Marson didn’t understand why Sondland was trying to get into the Warsaw meeting September 1st and Dr. Hill, Fiona Hill told us about issues of that sort and a number of witnesses, you’re correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I believe ambassador Reeker-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Said he was a problem, yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	She did. She had issues with his tendency to pull out his mobile device and make telephone calls, which obviously can be monitored by the bad guys.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He admitted he exaggerated.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He also, when it comes to his communications with the president, we tried to get him to list all the communications with the president, I think he gave us six. And then when he was back at it, he walked us through each communication with the president. And by the way, it was about a Christmas party. It was about when the president of Finland was here. And then Congresswoman Spear asked him the same question in the open hearing, and he said that he had talked to the president 20 times. So the record is mixed.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes, that’s right.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes, he did. Burisma was one of the most corrupt companies in Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s right. And also Washington Post a lot of publications and the State Department.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The state department was so concerned about this, they gave her a mock Q&A on this question.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s correct. Then, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified that there was an investigation into Burisma into their head Zlochevsky and they were trying to track down 23 million that he had taken out of the country. They were working with the United Kingdom. They were working United States, the United Kingdom, Ukraine was working on tracking this money down and there was an investigation, an active investigation going on and a bribe was paid and that bribe was paid. It allowed Zlochevsky to get off scott free. Right around that time is when Burisma went about sprucing up their board, shall we say.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We don’t know.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes sir.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ambassador Sondland.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	611 times.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s probably the best they got.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yep.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes, I have.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Big number.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I have no idea.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No idea.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t remember that
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t remember seeing it.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, there’s four things that will never change and that is, the transcript is complete and accurate. It shows no quid pro quo, no conditionality, that’s number one. Number two, there was no pressure both Zelensky and Trump have said that repeatedly. President Zelensky said that at United Nations on September 25th. He said in subsequent news articles on October 6th and October 10th and December 1st. Number three, the Ukrainians and Zelensky did not know about the pause in aid at the very least at the time of the call. And number four, no investigations were announced, the aid was released, and the White House afforded a meeting and president Trump met with Zelensky in New York.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s unfortunate.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Since 2005.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t remember any.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Oh, but they did a study. I mean they-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ambassador Taylor discussed that they researched
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t know the number.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I’m not-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When a witness personally observes a fact and testifies to it.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, I think out of court statement offered for the truth of the matter is certainly is something that you learn in law school.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s right. There’s about 23, plus the residual exception.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	A lot of it is, yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Like I said, I did a search just to control F in the name Sondland shows up 611 times.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That is correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s right.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Because it’s not reliable.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We had some direct evidence on certain things. I mean, we had some direct evidence on the May 23rd meeting, and Sondland gave some direct evidence, but a lot of what we’ve obtained has been circumstantial.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, we have not gotten to the bottom of that from a direct evidence standpoint.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s correct, too.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The facts surrounding that are ambiguous.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yep.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He did end the burden sharing of European allies.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Like I said, there’s eight lines in the call transcript to go to what president Trump said about the investigations, eight lines.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s inconclusive. Certainly.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t know if I was suppressed or not.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah. I’ve seen that.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I haven’t seen that. No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I haven’t seen news reports today.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Good heavens, no.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, he was worried about leaks.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes. A number of witnesses can also said the same thing.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes. All the witnesses confirmed the environment is a very corrupt.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Big time.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah. The New Yorker also had a pretty extensive report on that as well.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It is.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ukraine received a meeting with Vice President Pence in Warsaw and a meeting not at the White House, but in New York, at the United Nations.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He did. Thank you. And I yield back.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, the first thing about the complaint that troubles us is that it’s clearly from an outsider who received information secondhand. The information presented in the complaint is clearly distorted and it’s from a person who is, it seems to be making a case, like an advocate, about what happened on the call. The whistleblower references a number of individuals inside the White House and at the State Department that he or she has spoken to, to form the basis of the complaint, we have not been able to piece together all those people. And talking to all those people is important, and there’s a lot of… I’m running out of time here, but there’s a reference to Lutsenko in the whistleblower complaint, where witnesses have told us it’s likely Shokin. Vindman and Morrison’s testimony about why they went to talk to the lawyers, very different reasons. Mr. Brechbuhl-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t believe he was on the call, but…
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes, it did.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We went through and counted over 50 instances of key facts [crosstalk 02:28:02]-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	A lot of the information for example, that Ambassador Taylor was communicating, he very diligently recorded notes about what some of the various officials told him, but it was about… It was one and two steps removed from the actual fact, and that’s the problem with hearsay, is that it’s a whisper down the lane situation and if some of the people that are doing the whispering are predisposed to not like President Trump, than what they’re whispering down the lane becomes even more distorted.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The biggest one of course, and this has sort of become the big daddy of the hearing is, is Sondland presuming that the aid was tied to the investigations because as he engaged in a back and forth with Mr. Turner, nobody on the planet told him that that was the case.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Absolutely.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The Constitution.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The people, yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, for example, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified that when he was listening to the call, he had prepared talking points and the call package and he was visibly just completely deflated when he realized that his call notes weren’t being referenced by the President. And a lot of the inner agency officials, I think became very sad that the President didn’t revere their policy making apparatus.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think the President in skeptical of the inner agency bureaucracy.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Correct. And by the way, all three of those officials are not that far outside of the chain of the US government.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Certainly would be.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That’s correct, yeah.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Absolutely. I mean, this all goes to the heart of bias.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The President had a good faith belief there were some significant Ukrainian officials-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I haven’t said that the Ukrainian government-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I’m not. Correct.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I’m aware of it, yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s correct, but-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	No.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He did.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It has not.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I hope so.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yes.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Thank you. I’ve resisted my willingness to be athletic here in the afternoon. But I want to say a few things. First of all, the Republicans on the Intelligence Committee submitted a number of subpoenas and we never got a vote. There was a motion to table that disposed of them. Ranking member Nunes sent a letter on November 8th asking for witnesses, ranking member Collins sent a letter on December 6th asking for witnesses. Some of these witnesses would have touched at the heart of the issue that our members are concerned about. And that is were Ukrainians trying to interfere with our elections? I mean, this is a fact that is meritorious of investigation.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The Ukrainians ought to investigate it and to the extent it happened here in the US, we ought to be investigating it. And so to the extent that hasn’t happened, Republicans have attempted to do that during this process. So I’d like to say that. And I have a couple of other things, Mr. Armstrong, if I may. Ambassador Sondland relied on, and he went from a witness that was not very favorable to very favorable at his hearing. And one of the remarkable statements at his hearing was that everyone was in the loop. And he types up this email to Pompeo, to the Secretary. And the emails that he used to demonstrate that everyone was in the loop are not conclusive at all.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He talks about this statement that was going back and forth during the early part of August. First of all, Volker said all along that he didn’t think the statement was a good idea. Volker and Yermak toyed around with the statement and ultimately both sides decided that it wasn’t a good plan, so they didn’t do it. And so the fact that Sondland is emailing the Secretary talking about this statement and so forth… This doesn’t show that everyone’s in the loop. Ambassador Hale testified to us the people at the State Department, they don’t just email the Secretary. I mean the secretary gets email of course, but it’s not like this. There’s a whole secretariat that filters his email, and so emailing the Secretary of State is not quite as simple as I think Ambassador Sondland made it seem here. And so I just wanted to address that.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We talked a couple times about the reliability of George Kent’s notes. One of Ambassador Volker’s assistants, Catherine Croft testified, it was a rather startling piece of testimony, she was asked whether Kent’s notes would be reliable. Sort of a typical question. Everyone expecting the answer to be yes, except she said “No, I don’t think Kent’s notes would be reliable.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So I think that’s important to put on the record that there is evidence that perhaps Mr. Kent felt some emotions about some of these issues and his notes, at least according to one State Department official, might not in fact be reliable.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The CNN interview that there’s been discussion about. There was discussion about possibly doing a statement which was canned. Maybe there was discussion of a CNN interview, but we did not really get to the bottom of that. That was sort of this amorphous fact that was out there. Ambassador Taylor testified that he was worried it would happen, but we didn’t really talk to anyone that could tell us precisely what was going to occur in the CNN interview and whether President Zelensky was actually going to do it. If you look back at the statement that Yermak and Volker were talking about, Yermak wasn’t comfortable doing it.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And so when it comes to the CNN interview, it’s possible that Yermak would have advised President Zelensky not to say what people thought he was going to say. So anyway, I’m sorry, Mr. Armstrong.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	May I respond to that?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I wouldn’t agree with that.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s too early.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I don’t know what President Trump believed or didn’t believe, but it’s too early. Can I add something there?
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	President Trump did mention-
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He did mention that there’s some very bad people there. [crosstalk 03:33:09].
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Come on Barry, in fairness here, President Trump talks about very bad people.
2019-12-09	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s obvious they were trying to figure something out.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Ambassador, welcome. Thank you for your service. 33 years, an extraordinary career. It really has been a remarkable tenure for you at the State Department. Also, I’d like to thank you for participating here today. This is a crazy environment. This hearing room is turned into a television studio. Before today, you spent… On Friday the 11th, you were with us for early in the morning until I believe it was eight o’clock at night. People missed trains back to New York, and it was a very complete day. So thank you.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You were serving a three-year assignment in the Ukraine, is that correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And it began in 2016 and was scheduled to end in 2019?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Nobody disputes that it’s up to the president to decide who his envoys are to posts around the world, correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You returned from the Ukraine on May 20th, 2019?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And your return coincided with the inauguration of President Zelensky?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you remain employed by the State Department?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And after you returned to Washington, the deputy secretary, John Sullivan, asked you what you wanted to do next, is that correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And then you met with the director general, Ambassador Perez?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	To identify a meaningful new assignment?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you now serve at Georgetown University as a fellow?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And this is a rewarding position for you?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Today is the second big hearing for the Democrats’ impeachment initiative. But we don’t understand… or we do understand that you don’t have a lot of facts and information relating to the part of this that we’re investigating. And those are the events from May 20th up until September 11th, the release of the security assistance funds, is that correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	"So you were not part of the delegation to the inauguration; that was the day you returned. You were not part of the Oval Office meeting May 23rd, correct?"
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you were not part of the decision-making relating to whether there would be a White House meeting with President Zelensky?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You were not a part of any decision-making in the lead-up to the the July 25th call?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you first learned about the call on September 25th, is that correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And what did he tell you about the call?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And you learned about that before the call was made public?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Likewise, you were not involved in any discussions surrounding the security sector assistance funds to Ukraine? That they were paused for about 55 days from July 18th to September 11th?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. In your opening statement on page nine, you stated, “… although then and now I’ve always understood that I served at the pleasure of the President, I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine US interests in this way. Individuals who apparently felt stymied by our efforts to promote stated US policy against corruption, that is, to do the mission, were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against the sitting ambassador using unofficial back channels.” Do you believe that President Trump was aiming to weaponize corruption in Ukraine by removing you?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Do you believe your removal was part of some scheme to make it easier for elements of the Ukrainian establishment to do things counter to US interests?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And do you think they were seeking a different type of ambassador that would allow them to achieve some of their objectives?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Is Ambassador Taylor the type of person that would facilitate those objectives?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So Ambassador Taylor is a man of high integrity?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And he’s a good pick for the post?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But he certainly has had a decorated career serving his country?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You testified about when you first learned that Mayor Giuliani and some of his associates were… had a concerted campaign against you. When did that first come to your attention?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	At some point I believe you testified that Minister Avakov alerted you to this campaign?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When was that?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And do you remember what he related to you?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you have any awareness at that point in time of precisely why they were seeking your ouster?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Were you especially influential implementing policies that stymied their interests in Ukraine? Or advocating for some sort of environment or policies that would be adverse to them?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And was that source of frustration ever expressed to you? Or did you just learn that separately?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	On Fruman and Parnas.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Well, you mentioned that they had business interests and I asked you whether they had been stymied by anything in particular that you had advocated for, or you were a roadblock to them being successful. I wondered if there was any connection.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And at any point, did you ever try to reach out to the prosecutor general, Mr. Lutsenko, and find out why he was participating in this concerted campaign?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And then, why didn’t you do that?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And why not?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When did you first realize that your relationship with Lutsenko had reached a adversarial point?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And this is March?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	All right. And then you mentioned you contacted the State Department in late March. Was that under Secretary Hale?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	About the concerns you had about the campaign against you?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When did you realize this?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And when did you realize this concerted campaign against you was a real threat?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	A threat to your ability to do the job in Kyiv?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you undertake any efforts to push back on this narrative either inside the State Department or publicly?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In hindsight, do you think you did enough inside the State Department to alert them to this mounting campaign against you?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And what was that?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Did you get any feedback from your chain of command? I mean, did you engage Ambassador Reeker-
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	… And Under Secretary Hale?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you develop sort of a game plan to push back against these allegations?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you think there was anything you could’ve done differently to get ahead of the story? And to lobby the Secretary and his counselor, Mr. Brechbuhl, that there was a concerted campaign against you, that you didn’t believe the allegations lodged were accurate and you needed their assistance?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The corruption is endemic in the country of Ukraine, right?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you testified rampant corruption has long permeated Ukraine’s political and economic systems?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And it’s your belief that it should be the US foreign policy to help Ukraine curb its corruption problem?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And anti-corruption efforts you mentioned serve a national security purpose?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Are oligarchs a big part of the problem in Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And a lot of their power has been acquired through what we here in the US would consider improper ways?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The head of Burisma, Mr. Zlochevsky. You familiar with him?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	George Kent testified a couple of days ago that he was investigating for stealing millions and millions of dollars, some of which had been supplied by the US, Great Britain, subject to an investigation trying to get the money back. That was a big part of Mr. Kent’s initiatives when he was there. That a bribe was paid to the prosecutors and Zlochevsky was let off the hook. This was in 2014. Is this something that you’re familiar with?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mr. Kent testified that this bribe was paid, that prosecution went away, and essentially nothing has been further done with regards to Burisma. During your tenure in Ukraine, has there ever been any focus on re-examining allegations, whether it’s Burisma or other powerful interests, like Zlochevsky? Re-examining it?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, trying to lean on the various prosecutors general to clean up the oligarchical system.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And right around the time that the bribe was paid, Burisma undertook an effort to spruce up their board and they added, I believe, the president of Poland and some other luminaries. Are you familiar with that?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	One of the folks they added to the board was the vice president’s son, Hunter Biden, which raises questions. Is he a genius on the corporate governance front? Is he a genius with the Ukrainian oligarchical systems and cleaning that up? Or was he just added to the board because he’s the vice president’s son? Was that ever a concern, or at least the perception of that concern addressed?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Was the issue ever raised at all?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He was still on the board, I think, at the time.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He was still on the board when you arrived at post, and was just wondering if at least the perception problem was brought to your attention as the ambassador?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. In your deposition, you acknowledged that the president has longstanding concerns about corruption in Ukraine. Is that true?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Going back to… There was a meeting with President Poroshenko in September of 2017 in the Oval Office, and I believe you testified that he expressed his concerns then.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Several witnesses have testified that the president has concerns that there are certain elements of the Ukrainian establishment that during 2016 were out to get him. Is that something you were aware of at any point in time?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We’ve gone through the deposition. Some of these elements that… maybe they loom larger now, but in hindsight, was there any discussion at the embassy that there’s these indications of some Ukrainians trying to at least advocate against then-candidate Trump?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And were you aware, I know Mr. Nunes mentioned this earlier, the consultant Alexandra Chalupa had reportedly, at least according to her and according to Ken Vogel at the Politico, was trying to work with the Ukrainian embassy in DC to trade information, share leads of that sort of thing?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you see the article at the time, or did that only come to your attention subsequently?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you’re the ambassador in-country at this point. Did you aim to get to the bottom of that? Because if true, if the reporting’s true, if what Miss Chalupa told Mr. Vogel is accurate, that would be concerning, correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And do you know Miss Chalupa?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Have you ever met her?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Are you aware of the role that investigative journalist, Mr. Leshchenko, played in publicizing the Manafort black ledgers?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And he publicized some information in a pretty grand way in August of 2016, and almost immediately coincided with Mr. Manafort leaving the Trump campaign. Was there anything about that issue, when it was occurring, that concerned you?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But you can understand the president, at least from his perspective, looking at these facts, it certainly is reasonable to conclude that there are elements of the Ukrainian establishment that are advocating against him, at this point in time, correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But the way the events unfolded, I mean, Mr. Manafort was … subsequently left the campaign, and it certainly did begin a period of interest in Manafort’s ties to Russia, and so forth.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	With Mr. Leshchenko’s reporting, I mean, there’s been a question of whether all the information that he published was authentic, correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Some have questioned whether the information Mr. Leshchenko published was all correct or whether it was doctored.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Ambassador Chaly, during the August timeframe, he wrote an op-ed in The Hill taking issue with then candidate Trump. Were you aware of that when it occurred?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you have any communications with the ambassador to express concerns?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And how frequently did you communicate with the ambassador? Obviously, you’re in different posts in different countries, but-
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So you weren’t in frequent communication?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Can you see how writing an op-ed even given the substance … We’ve discussed the substance of it, that there’s sensitivities, but can you see how just the simple fact of writing an op-ed, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US might create a perception that there are elements of the Ukrainian establishment that were advocating against then candidate Trump?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And do you know whether the ambassador or anybody from the embassy tried to make contact with the Trump camp to talk about their concerns before lodging an op-ed?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. During the same time period, in the run up to the election, the Minister Avakov had said some especially candid things about then candidate Trump on some various social media platforms. Are you aware of that?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, but during the relevant time period when it was happening, you weren’t aware of that?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. He’s one of the more influential officials in the Ukraine, correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I believe he’s one of the few that span both the Poroshenko administration and the Zelensky administration?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Looking back on his comments in hindsight, do you see how that might create a perception that a very influential Ukrainian was advocating against then candidate Trump?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He was out to get him. I mean, he said some real nasty things.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I’m shocked that social media would be the site of negative comments. You certainly can understand that the president aware of Minister Avakov’s statements, aware of what Mr. Leshchenko was up to, what Ambassador Chaly was up to, and these other elements that we’ve discussed that there’s certainly forms of reasonable basis to wonder whether there are influential elements of the Ukrainian establishment that were out to get the president.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Turn our attention to Ambassador Volker. He’s been a friend and colleague of yours for many years. Is that correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And I believe you testified he’s a man of honor?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And a brilliant diplomat?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you have no reason to think that he would be undertaking any initiative that was counter to US interests?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Turning our attention to the Trump administration’s policy of aid, the aid package to Ukraine. You’ve testified that during your tenure as ambassador America’s policy actually got stronger toward Ukraine. Is that accurate?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And why was that important?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The provision of Javelins to Ukraine was blocked during the previous administration. Is that correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But do you have any understanding of what the interagency consensus was with regard to Javelins during the previous administration?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And so in the new administration under President Trump, the ability to afford Ukraine this weaponry is a significant advantage, significant step forward?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And has it played out that way?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Provision of Javelins.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ukraine still has the ability to acquire the Javelins though, correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Purchasing-
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And the security sector assistance did go through. It was paused for 55 days from July 18th to September 11th but it ultimately went through, correct?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. You testified during your deposition that you were proud of the efforts of the United States during your tenure to supply this type of aid to Ukraine. Are you still happy with the decisions?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The Javelin and also just the whole aid package.
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you think it’s sufficient? Do you think we’re giving Ukraine enough money?
0201-11-15	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I see my time is coming to an end. Mr. Chairman?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Thank you Mr. Nunes. I’ll try to be quick and yield some time back, so we don’t have to use every last minute.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ambassador Volker, are you aware of a statement just last week from Foreign Minister Prystaiko? He said that no one ever told the Ukrainians, certainly not him, that there was any linkage between the security assistance funds and investigations.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And do you know of the foreign minister?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And during times of relevant, did you ever have any discussions with him about the investigations and links?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The primary person you worked with was Mr. Yermak?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Mr. Yermak also had some meetings with Ambassador Sondland. Did Mr. Yermak ever give you any feedback from his interactions with Ambassadors Sondland?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The episode at Warsaw where apparently Ambassadors Sondland pulled Mr. Yermak aside. Did Mr. Yermak give you any feedback on that meeting?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And does the Ukrainian officials, to the best of your knowledge, they trusted you?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And so when you made statements like that to them, do you think they believed you?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And they also trusted Ambassador Taylor?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Just like to demystify a little bit of the whole Mayor Giuliani role here. You met with him I believe one time?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you had some exchange, some text messages with him, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And during your deposition we did an accounting of your communications with Mr. Giuliani. And it wasn’t that there weren’t that many. We sort of accounted for them all. And then Ambassador Sondland, when he came in, he didn’t have any one-on-one meetings with Mayor Giuliani to your knowledge, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And in fact, I think Ambassador Sondland testified that there were a couple of conference calls that he may have been on with you.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Just getting back to the irregular channel that Ambassador Taylor coined in his deposition testimony. Did you ever have an opportunity to close the loop with him about any concerns whatsoever? Or was it all just these specific instances raised in the texts?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you think Ambassador Taylor and your communications with him believe that Mr. Giuliani was in far greater communication with yourself, Secretary Perry and Ambassador Sondland?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. I think that’s all I had, Mr. Nunes. Do you?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Thank you, Ranking Member Nunes. The call transcript as published on September 25th is complete and accurate. Will both of you attest to that? Ms. Williams?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Of course.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Colonel Vindman?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think in your testimony, your deposition, you said, “very accurate?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And you flagged a couple edits, Colonel Vindman I think you had Burisma on page four where President Zelensky was talking about the company mentioned in the issue?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I believe in your testimony, you explained that you offered an edit that on page four of the transcript that was ultimately published you thought President Zelensky mentioned the word, Burisma.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And Ms. Williams … and that was on page four, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Ms. Williams, I believe after your deposition you went back and checked your notes and you had President Zelensky using the term, Burisma as well. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But that came up on a different part of the transcript than what Colonel Vindman was relating to, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yours came up on page five and it would’ve been in substitution for the word, case?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Colonel Vindman, we’ve had some discussion earlier today and also at your deposition about whether the President had a demand for President Zelensky. I suggested to you in the deposition that the President’s words are in fact ambiguous and he uses some phrases that certainly could be characterized as hedging. On page three, in the first paragraph he talks about whatever you can do, he talks about if that’s possible. On page four he mentions, “if you could speak to him” and you talk about the attorney general, Rudy Giuliani. And then at the end of the first paragraph on page four, he says, “whatever you can do,” the President also says, “if you can look into it.” And I asked you during your deposition whether you saw or acknowledged the fact that certain people could read that to be ambiguous.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And I believe you said, “I think people want to hear what they have already preconceived.” Is that what you testified?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	256
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And then you went on to say, yeah, you agreed with me, you said, “Yeah, I guess you could interpret it different ways.” Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Turning attention to the preparation of the transcript, that followed the ordinary process, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, I’ll get to that in a second, that that relates to the storage of it. You had some concerns. Mr. Morrison articulated his concerns about if the transcript was leaked out. And I think both you and Mr. Morrison agreed that it needed to be protected.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mr. Morrison testified at his deposition.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right, and even on the codeword server, you had access to it?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So at no point in time during the course of your official duties were you denied access to this information?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Is that correct? Ms. Williams, I want to turn to you for a moment. And you testified that you believed that transcript is complete and accurate other than the one issue you mentioned.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Now, did you express any concerns to anyone in your office about what you heard on the call?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you never had any concerns with anyone else in the vice president’s office?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So you didn’t flag it for the chief of staff or the vice president’s counsel or anyone of that sort?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right. And after the call, did you in General Kellogg ever discussed the contents of the call?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now in the run up to the meeting in Warsaw, the vice president was meeting with President Zelensky September 1st in Warsaw. You were involved with the preparation of the vice president’s briefing materials?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you flag for the vice president parts of call that had concerned you?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So just wondering if the concerns were so significant, how come nobody on the vice president’s staff at least alerted him to the issue that President Zelensky might be on edge about something that had been mentioned on the 7/25 call?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And to your recollection, you were in the meeting with President Zelensky and Vice President Pence?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Burisma didn’t come up or the Bidens or any of these investigations?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Colonel Vindman, you testified that the President has well standing or longstanding concerns about corruption in Ukraine, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But you would agree that if the U.S. is giving, hundreds of millions of dollars to a foreign nation that has a corruption problem, that’s certainly something that the U.S. government officials and the President would want to be concerned about?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And if a foreign country has a problem with oligarchs taking money, taking U.S. tax payer dollars that’s something that the President ought to be concerned about in advance of dispensing the aid?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And I believe you did testify that corruption is endemic in Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Are you also aware of the President’s skepticism of foreign aid, generally?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And it’s something that he’s made part of his priorities to make sure that U.S. foreign aid is spent wisely?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you’re also aware of the President has concerns about burden-sharing among our allies?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And with respect to Ukraine, he was very interested and engaged in seeing if there was a possibility for our European allies to step up and contribute more?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But you are aware of the President’s concern of burden-sharing, right?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Turning our attention specifically to the company Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, the co-founder of Burisma, it’s one of Ukraine’s largest natural gas producers, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And it’s been subject to numerous investigations over the years.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Zlochevsky had served as the minister of ecology during President Yanukovych’s tenure?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And are you aware, and George Kent testified a little bit about this last week, that under the Obama administration, the U.S. government encouraged Ukraine to investigate whether Zlochevsky used his government position to grant himself or Burisma exploration licenses, are you aware of that?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And he testified that the U.S. along with the United Kingdom was engaged in trying to recoup about 23 million in taxpayer dollars from Zlochevsky and the Burisma entity.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And Mr. Kent also testified that the investigation was moving along and then all of a sudden there was a bribe paid and the investigation went away. Did you hear him mention that?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Fair enough. Right around the time the bribe was paid, the company sought to bolster their board. Are you aware that they tapped some luminaries for their corporate board?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Including the president of Poland, I believe.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Hunter Biden?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And are you aware of any specific experience Hunter Biden has in the Ukrainian corporate governance world?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And we talked a little bit about at your deposition about whether Mr. Biden was qualified to serve on this board. And I believe you acknowledged that apparently he was not in fact qualified.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I believe you acknowledged that apparently he was not in fact qualified?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Ms. Williams, I want to turn our attention to the inaugural trip.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	At one point, the Vice President and the Vice President’s office was focusing on attending that, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	It’s somewhat complicated because as I understand it, the White House doesn’t want the President and the Vice President to be out of the country at the same time?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And during the timeframe, the President was in Japan. I believe he was in Japan, May 24th to 28th, and then he returned to Europe for the D-Day ceremonies June 2nd to 7th. And I think you told us that there was a window. You provided a four days at the end of May, that if the Vice President was going to attend the inauguration, it had to be the 29th, 30th, 31st, or 1st?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And before the Vice President travels to a foreign nation, you have to send the Secret Service, do advance work, book hotels. It’s a relatively involved preparation experience, right?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you know if the Secret Service ever deployed, booked hotels or anything of that sort?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But ultimately, the Secret Service, as I understand it, did not deploy.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And President Zelensky’s inauguration was May 20th, if I’m not mistaken?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you had about four days notice?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So you would acknowledge that that made it quite difficult for the Vice President and the whole operation to mobilize and get over to Ukraine, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When did that happen?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. How did you hear about that?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. As I understand it, it was the assistant to the chief of staff?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So you didn’t hear about it from General Kellogg, or the chief of staff, or-
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	… the President, or the Vice President?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You heard about it from Mr. Short’s assistant.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Did you have any knowledge of the reasoning for stopping the trip?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But do you know why the President decided?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And ultimately, the Vice President went to Canada for a USMCA event-
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	… during this window of time, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So it’s entirely conceivable that the President decided that he wanted the Vice President to go to Canada on behalf of USMCA instead of doing anything else, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, you know the Vice President’s done quite a bit of USMCA events, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Are you aware of whether anyone at the State Department inquired with your office about the Vice President’s availability for the trip to Canada?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Early May. Maybe May 8th.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But ultimately, you don’t know.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You don’t know the reason as to why the Vice President was sent to Canada for a USMCA event instead of going to the Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Colonel Vindman, I’d like to turn a little bit to the July 10th meeting in Ambassador Bolton’s office, and the subsequent post-meeting in the ward room. Who all was in the July 10th meeting, to the best of your recollection?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	We’ll start with the first meeting in the Ambassador’s office.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Who from the Ukrainians? Sorry.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. You testified that you couldn’t recall exactly why Ambassador Bolton stopped the meeting short, and you only learned it subsequently in talking to Dr. Fiona Hill?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the Bolton meeting, you don’t remember Ambassador Sondland using the word “Biden”?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And then the group decamped to take a photo, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So the general feeling of the group was a positive one at that time, even though it may have ended abruptly.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So you went out to West Executive Ave or wherever in the White House, and you took a photo. I think you said you took it?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the photo is Secretary Perry, Ambassador Bolton, Ambassador Volker-
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	… Mr. Danylyuk, and Mr. Yermak?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now, you testified that before the July 10th meeting, you had developed concerns about the narrative involving Rudy Giuliani. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And had you heard a firsthand account from anyone on the inside, or you just been following news accounts?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And then-
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So when Ambassador Sondland mentioned the investigations, you sort of had a little bit of a clue of what the issue was?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And then you took the photo, a very nice photo, and then you went to the ward room?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you remember… I think you conceded to us that you had a hard time remembering exactly what was said in the ward room. Again, it’s four months ago. It’s hard to be precise about whether Sondland… What specific words he used, whether he used Burisma, 2016 investigations. Is-
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the ward room?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I think we can maybe go back to this, but I think on page 64 of your testimony, you told us that you don’t remember him using “2016” in the ward room?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When we asked the question, it sort of refreshed your recollection?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. There was some discussion of whether when Mr. Morrison took over the portfolio for Dr. Hill, whether you were sidelined at all. Did you feel like you were?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Did you express any concerns to Mr. Morrison about why you weren’t included on those trips?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And what feedback did he give you?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Had you ever had any discussions with Mr. Morrison about concerns that he or Dr. Hill had with your judgment?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Did Mr. Morrison ever express concerns to you that he thought maybe you weren’t following the chain of command in all instances?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did Dr. Hill or Mr. Morrison ever ask you questions about whether you were trying to access information outside of your lane?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And another aspect of the Ukraine portfolio that you were not a part of where some of the communications Mr. Morrison was having with Ambassador Taylor?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you ever express concern that he was leaving you off those calls?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. You went to Ukraine for the inauguration, May 20th?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	At any point during that trip, did Mr Danylyuk offer you a position of defense minister with the Ukrainian government?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And how many times did he do that?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And do you have any reason why he asked you to do that?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	I mean, Ukraine’s a country that’s experienced a war with Russia. Certainly their minister of defense is a pretty key position for the Ukrainians. Presidents Zielinski, Mr Danylyuk to bestow that honor on you, at least asking you, I mean, that was a big honor, correct?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When he made this offer to you initially did you leave the door open? Was there a reason that he had to come back and ask a second and third time, or was he just trying to convince you?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When he made this offer to you, was he speaking in English or Ukrainian?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And who were they?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Yeah, we met Mr Holmes last Friday evening.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you said when you returned to the United States, you papered it up given your… You know, with SCI clearance, whenever a foreign government makes a overture like that, you paper it up and you tell your chain of command?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And did any of your supervisors, Dr Hill at the time or Dr Kupperman or Ambassador Bolton, ever follow up with you about that? It’s rather significant, you know, the Ukrainians offered you the post of defense minister. Did you tell anyone in your chain of command about it?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So it never came up with Dr Kupperman or Dr Hill?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And did you brief Dr… Or, sorry, Director Morrison when he came onboard?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And subsequent to the did Mr Danylyuk ever ask you to reconsider? Were there any other offers?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When he visited for the July 10th meeting with Ambassador Bolton, did it come up again?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And did you ever think that possibly if this information got out, that it might create at least the perception of a conflict that the Ukrainians thought so highly of you to offer you the defense ministry post? You know, on one hand, but on the other hand, you’re responsible for Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And during the times relevant of the committee’s investigation, did you have any communications with Mr Yermak or Danylyuk outside of the July 10th meeting?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And where are you following this… you know, there’s sort of two tracks. Ambassador Taylor walked us through it during his testimony last Wednesday. He called it a regular channel and then he called it an irregular, but not outlandish channel with Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker. Were you tracking the Sondland and Volker channel during this time period?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And I think we had some discussion that Mr Giuliani was promoting a negative narrative about the Ukraine and certain officials were trying to help the president understand that with Zielinski it was a new day and Ukraine is going to be different. Is that your understanding?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And to the extent that you’re aware of what Ambassador Sondland’s goals were here and Ambassador Volker’s goals were here, you think they were just trying to do the best they could and try to advocate in the best interest of the United States?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And so to the extent Mr Giuliani may have had different views, they were trying to help him understand that it was time to change those views?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you never conferred with Mr Giuliani?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You never had any meetings, phone calls, or anything of that sort?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you have any-
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	America’s Mayor.
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did you have any discussions, communications, during this relevant time period with the president?
0201-11-19	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. My time’s expired, Mr Chairman. Thank you.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ambassador Taylor, Mr. Kent, President Trump’s concerns about Ukraine’s role in the 2016 election. You believe he genuinely believed they were working against him, right? Ambassador Taylor?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Didn’t he in this Oval Office meeting on May 23rd after the Zelensky inauguration, didn’t he lament that the Ukrainians were out to get them?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But from the president’s perspective if the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, one of the most influential diplomats, is penning an op ed certainly with the okay of President Poroshenko, the DNC consultants are conferring with Ukrainian officials at the embassy. Former Prime Minister Yatsenyuk is saying things on social media, Interior Minister Avakov, who has a spanned both the Poroshenko and the Zelensky realm, is also saying some very unkind things on social media about the president. You certainly can appreciate that President Trump was very concerned that some elements of the Ukrainian establishment were not in favor of him, did not support him, and were out to get him.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Parliamentary inquiry, are you seriously interrupting our time here?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So you certainly can appreciate president Trump’s concerns.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	In the information published by Serhiy Leshchenko, former Ukrainian investigative journalist, and then he was a member of the parliament about the Manafort black ledgers in August of 2016, the very day that was published, Mr. Manafort resigned from the campaign, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Certainly that gives rise to some concern that there are elements of the Ukrainian establishment that were out to get the president. That’s a very reasonable belief of his. Correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The run up to the 2016 election, there’s many facts that remain unresolved. Agreed?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	There are many facts relating to the run-up of the 2016 election that remain unresolved.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well, Attorney General Barr, in May of 2019 tasked the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, John Durham, to broadly examine the government’s collection of intelligence involving the president’s campaign. That effort, initially it was an administrative review, has turned into a criminal probe. And U.S. Attorney Durham is casting a wide net, and is following the facts where they may lead. Are you aware of that?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And so to the extent any information resides in Ukraine, it’s perfectly appropriate for the Ukrainians to try to get to the bottom of that, for the Ukrainians to cooperate with the United States through official channels to share that information. Correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	To the extent Ukraine has facts related to the run-up of the 2016 election that are under the U.S. Attorney Durham’s probe, Ukraine should cooperate with the United States. And to the extent there are Ukrainians doing improper things, the Ukrainians ought to investigate that themselves. Correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So when the president on the call transcript of July 25th, raises this with President Zelensky, and he urges that there be a connection between the Ukrainian government and the Justice Department, officially, I mean that’s the appropriate way to raise an issue with the Ukrainian president. Correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But to the extent the president has concerns, and to the extent the attorney general is having U.S. Attorney Durham look into that, isn’t it entirely appropriate for the president to flag this for President Zelensky, and say that you should be in touch with our official channels?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Now, were either of you involved with the preparation for the 7/25 call?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And how do you account for that? I mean, you are two of the key officials with responsibility for Ukrainian policy. If the president of the United States is going to have a call with the leader of Ukraine, why wouldn’t you ordinarily be involved with the preparation?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So the Chargé, or the U.S. Ambassador to the country wouldn’t ordinarily be on a call with a foreign leader?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did Colonel Vindman or anyone at the National Security Council staff reach out to you, Mr. Kent, in preparation for the call?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Did you provide any substantive advice to Colonel Vindman about the call and what ought to be the official position?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Same with you, Ambassador?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You testified earlier that the call was on again, off again, and after the July 10th meeting with Ambassador Bolton, the consensus was the call was not going to happen. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And the call was scheduled. And did you get a readout, Ambassador Taylor, initially from the call?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And how about you, Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Ambassador Taylor, you said that the Ukrainian readout was cryptic. Is that just because it’s initially written in Ukrainian and translated to the U.S.?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And you mentioned it was cryptic. Why did you think it was cryptic?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That seems pretty ordinary.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You were with president Zelensky the very next day?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did president Zelensky raise any concerns about his views of the call?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And did you get any additional readouts subsequently about the call? When did you first learn that the call contained things that concerned you? Was that not until September 25th?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Giuliani was heard [phrased 00:13:11] on the call by President Zelensky, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Yeah, it’s on page three. The first mention of Giuliani was from President Zelensky, it’s on page three. And President Zelensky says, “I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently, and we were hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine, and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.” Did that surprise you?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But the way Zelensky states it here, it sounds like he is very much looking forward to speaking with America’s Mayor.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now Mr. Kent, corruption in Ukraine’s endemic, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And it affects the courts, the prosecutors, and there have historically been problems with all the prosecutors in Ukraine. Correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	"Okay. And so the U.S. government, the consensus though at the State Department and the National Security Council, and the White House is that Zelensky’s the real deal. He’s a real reformer; he’s genuinely interested in rooting out corruption, prosecuting the bad guys, correct?"
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And at the heart of the corruption is the oligarchical system, correct? Where the oligarchs take control often by virtual theft of … for example, the right to certain energy licenses. Correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And the company, Burisma, it’s leader, Zlochevsky, he has a little bit of a storied history of corruption, doesn’t he?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Certainly self-dealing.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And how did the Ukrainian government ultimately pursue that?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	He essentially paid a bribe to make the case go away.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now at any point in time, has anyone in the Ukrainian government tried to reinvestigate that, or did those crimes just go unpunished and was he free to go?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And are you in favor of that matter being fully investigated and prosecuted?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But in addition to prosecuting the person that took the bribe, shouldn’t the organization or individual that sponsored the bribes be prosecuted?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So this company, Burisma, involved in lots of criminal activity, correct? Over the years?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But over the years, it’s been involved in a number of questionable dealings, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So to the extent a new regime was coming in under President Zelensky, it certainly would be fair for the new prosecutor, a genuine prosecutor, to reexamine old crimes that hadn’t sufficiently been brought to justice, right?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now this, the bribe was paid in what year?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And right around that time, Burisma starts adding officials to its board, is that correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And do you know what his strategy was in adding officials to his board?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And who are some of the folks he added to the board?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And anyone else?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So Hunter Biden’s added to the board of Burisma. Now, do you think that creates a problem that Burisma may be adding people to its board for protection purposes?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Was Hunter Biden a corporation governance expert?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Like, is he the Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So you don’t know whether he as any business experience in Ukraine prior to joining Burisma’s board?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Do you know if he speaks Ukrainian?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you know if he possesses any other element other than the fact that he is the son of, at the time, the sitting Vice-President?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Ambassador Taylor, do you know whether Hunter Biden offers anything other than the fact that his dad’s the former Vice-President?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Or at the time, was the Vice-President?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But you would agree it raises questions, right? He was getting paid, I think, $50,000 a month to sit on the board? Do you know if he relocated to Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you know if Hunter Biden relocated to Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Do you know, Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So he’s getting paid $50,000 a month, but we don’t know whether he had any experience, he had any, spoke the language, or whether he moved to Ukraine, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Now at this time, Vice-President was taking a specific interest in Ukraine, wasn’t he?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And could you tell us about that?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And you were the DCM, the Deputy Chief of Mission, at the time, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And did Vice-President Biden come when you were at post?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now you’ve seen Vice-President Biden’s, he’s sort of given a speech, and he’s a little folksy about how he went into Ukraine and he told the Ukrainians that if they don’t fire the prosecutor, they’re going to lose their $1 billion in loan guarantees. You’ve seen that, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Right. And he also said that he’s been there, Ukraine, 13 times. Do you know if that’s accurate?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And did the State Department ever express any concerns to the Vice-President’s office that the Vice-President’s role at the time in engaging on Ukraine presented any issues?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. But given Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board of directors, at some point you testified in your deposition that you expressed some concern to the Vice-President’s office. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And what did they do about that concern that you expressed?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And that was the end of it? Nobody …
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But after you expressed the concern of a perceived conflict of interest in the least, the Vice-President’s engagement in Ukraine didn’t decrease, did it?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Burisma didn’t cease, did it?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Now Ambassador Taylor, I want to turn to the discussion of the irregular channel you described. And in fairness, this irregular channel of diplomacy, it’s not as outlandish as it could be. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	"Okay. We have Ambassador Volker, who’s a former Senate-confirmed Ambassador to NATO; long-time State Department diplomat; and you’ve known Ambassador Volker for years, correct?"
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	A man of unquestioned integrity, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And somebody with incredible knowledge of the region.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And the best interests of the United States?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And the best interest of Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. And the second member of the irregular channel is Ambassador Sondland, who is Senate-confirmed Ambassador to the E.U., so his involvement here, while not necessarily part of his official duties as the Ambassador to the E.U., it certainly is not outlandish for him to be interested and engaged pursuant to the President or Secretary Pompeo’s direction, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	"Okay. And you know, it might be irregular, but it’s certainly not outlandish. And then Secretary Perry is the third member of the irregular channel. He’s certainly a Senate-confirmed official; somebody with deep experience in energy markets, and he was pursuing some liquified national, natural gas projects in Ukraine"
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So his involvement, Secretary
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	#NAME?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So his involvement, Secretary Perry’s involvement is perfectly acceptable?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now this irregular channel, as it developed, when did you determine that it became problematic? I mean, in your opening statement identified yourself appropriately as the leader of the regular channel.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	When did you first develop concerns that the irregular channel was being problematic?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	You arrived in Kyiv in June, right?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	June 17th.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. Now, you’ve known Ambassador Volker, and you’ve certainly have a reason to know Ambassador Sondland. What did you do at this point, or did you ever try to wrest control of the irregular channel?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Well why not though? If you had these concerns.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	But at some point you developed concerns. I mean, your opening statement is here. I mean, you’re the impeachment witness number one, and you’re number two, Mr. Kent. For the case impeaching the president of the United States because of the concerns you’ve testified about the irregular channel. Correct.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	As I understand the record, however, when you arrived in Ukraine, you had the support of the secretary and the secretary’s top advisor counselor, Ulrich Brechbuhl, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And they assured you that if you had any, you would be able to contact them and they would have your back.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And you knew going in that the Rudy Giuliani element presented some complexities, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	So when it genuinely became a concern for you, what did you do to either engage Sondland and Volker and Perry and Giuliani… By the way, have you ever met Rudy Giuliani during these times relevant?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. So you’ve never had any communications with Rudy Giuliani as part of these irregular channel business?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And anyway, getting back to my question, did you try to engage a Brechbuhl or the secretary during this time period? I know you said that you had I believe a August 21st or 22nd telephone call with Brechbuhl. You had a July 10th telephone call with Brechbuhl and then you sent a first-person cable to the secretary on August 29th.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Is that sort of the universe of initiatives you took inside the State Department to raise your concerns about the irregular channel?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	That was a June 28th call, I believe.
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	And in your opening statement you expressed some concerns about what Ambassador Sondland had said, but then once Zelensky got on the phone it proceeded in a very regular channel way, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The June 28th call, at least in and of itself, didn’t ultimately as it played out, present any problems for you?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay, and you didn’t have any issue with that, did you?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. I mean the president’s expressed his interest in certain investigations, certainly relating to the 2016 election and relating to this corrupt Burisma outfit. So that wasn’t inconsistent with the president’s message, right?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	The president’s concerns about the 2016 election and needing to get to the bottom of it and the president’s concerns as it ultimately related to the Burisma company. I mean, if Ambassador Volker is raising that with Zelensky that’s consistent with the direction of the president, correct?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	By the way, do you know how many times Volker met with Giuliani?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	How many would you guess? Was he talking to him all the time or meeting with them all the time?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Okay. At his deposition, he told us just once, and he texted back and forth with the mayor, had a call or two, but it wasn’t a pervasive engagement for ambassador Volker. Were you aware of that?
2019-11-13	Stephen Castor	Lawyer-R	Lawyer-R	Mr. Kent, before my time expires, I want to circle back to the company of Burisma. You testified at your deposition that there was an instance you USAID had engaged with Burisma, possibly sponsoring a program, and you took issue with that and recommended USAID to pull back from that. Could you tell us about that?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you both for being here. Dr. Hill, when we last left July 10th, I believe Ambassador Bolton said to you, ?You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go tell them what you heard and what I?ve said.? That?s correct, is that right?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And John Eisenberg, he?s the chief lawyer for the National Security Council, correct?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And you went to see him.
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And what did you say to him that day?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Of what took place?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Now, did you have one or two meetings with him at about that?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Did you raise the concerns that Ambassador Bolton had raised to you to Mr. Eisenberg?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	In the course of those two meetings, what was Mr. Eisenberg?s response?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	He didn?t say anything in response about how he took that meeting or how he would describe it? Did he raise any concerns about what you told him that took place?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Now, back to that July 10th meeting, the second meeting that?s in the wardroom, correct?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Who?s in that meeting besides yourself? The two Ukrainians?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	But Ambassador Volker was there during that entire [crosstalk 01:49:07]-
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	I think you described it as you came in, Ambassador Sondland was talking about how he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney for a meeting with the Ukrainians, if they were going forward with the investigations. While this was taking place and afterwards, how were the Ukrainians reacting to what was being said?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	He understood what was happening?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Did you have any followup to that, sir?
2019-11-21	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Given the time, I would yield back.
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Thank you. Madam Ambassador. It’s like a Hallmark movie. You ended up at Georgetown. This is all okay. But it wasn’t your preference seven, eight months ago, correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Wasn’t your preference to be the victim of a smear campaign, was it?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	It wasn’t your preference to be defamed by the President of the United States, including today, was it?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Wasn’t your preference to be ousted at seemingly the pinnacle of your career, was it?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	You wanted to finish your extended tour, correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	What did you want to do after that? Did you know?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	There’s nothing wrong with Georgetown. It’s a fine place, right?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	But it’s the only choice at the end of a distinguished career, after all that. It’s not the end of a Hallmark movie. It’s the end of a really bad reality TV show brought to you by someone who knows a lot about that.
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	You previously testified that you sought advice from Ambassador Sondland at this time about what to do. Is that correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Why did you reach out to the Ambassador?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And it meant a lot to you. This is an extraordinary time and the advice meant a lot, and what was his advice?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And what was your reaction to that advice?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Did he give you any specific suggestions on what to say about the President of the United States, or just say something nice about him?
0201-11-15	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Thank you. I yield the balance to the Chairman.
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador, I want to direct your attention to a meeting you had with Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Yermak September 14th in Kiev. Do you recall this meeting, sir?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Okay. And do you remember discussing with Mr. Yermak Ukraine’s intent to investigate their former president, Mr. Poroshenko?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	They brought it up. You raised it, and they talk about their intention.
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	So it’s fair to describe it as you discouraged him from such actions.
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And what was Mr. Yermak’s response?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Mr. Taylor.
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent.
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	So it was something along the lines of, “It’s okay for you to ask us to investigate in the manner in which you are, these so-called investigations, but you don’t want us to investigate our own president.” Is that a fair way to describe this?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Did you go and investigate what he might’ve meant or ask anybody?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	But in all this time, I mean, Mr. Giuliani in this time, in that May to September, he mentioned the Biden investigation. He mentioned Biden over 50 times and 20-something times in relation to Ukraine. None of that stirred your curiosity? You’ve just now finally come to this point?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Did you have any discussions with anyone in the State Department or anywhere else in the administration about concerns about the investigation into Poroshenko?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	I yield to the chairman.
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Colonel, it’s one thing to ask somebody a favor like, “Hey, go pick up my dry cleaning.”, And it’s another, when the Commander in Chief of the most powerful army in the world ask an ally who’s in a vulnerable position to do him a favor, is it not?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Let me go back to that military assistance if I could.
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Ms. Williams, again, when did you first learn that the security assistance was being held up, the nearly $400 million that was referenced?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And were you aware of any additional or did you attend any additional meetings in which that military assistance being withheld was discussed?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	At that point, did anyone provide a specific reason for the hold?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And did they give reasons beyond that it was being withheld by the White House Chief of Staff?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Did anyone in any of those meetings or in any other subsequent discussion you had, discuss the legality of withholding that aid?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And from what you witnessed, did anybody in the National Security Community support withholding the assistance?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Colonel, again, just for the record, when did you first learn the security assistance was being withheld?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And what exactly had you learned from the state department, I believe, that prompted you to draft the notice on July 3rd?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Had you had any earlier indications that this might be the case?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Were you aware of anyone in the National Security Community who supported withholding the aid?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	No one from the National Security?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	No one from the State Department?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	No one from the Department of Defense?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Did anyone, into your understanding, raise the legality of withholding this assistance?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And who raised those concerns?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	It was, excuse me?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	On the purely legal point of view?
0201-11-19	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Very good. I yield back to the Chairman.
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	That certification that took place in May, is that correct, Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	It was an earlier time-
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	But the DOD did meet, say that they met the certification?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Thank you. It’s interesting, and curious, that we’re talking about hearsay evidence. And it is extraordinary to me that the committee has been able to get as much information as they had, direct or hearsay, given the obstruction. You gentlemen were both asked, by the state department, not to appear for your depositions, is that correct?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Ambassador, were you also asked not to be part of the deposition?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Absolutely, but we were not able to hear testimony by Chief of Staff Mulvaney, John Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, John Bolton, more than a dozen witnesses, so I suspect if you have a problem with hearsay you’d have a lot more direct testimony and direct evidence if you weren’t blocking that ability. You would have a lot more documents, documents that you referred to with my colleagues’ questions that have not yet been turned over by state or any other agency. Is that correct, to your knowledge, gentlemen?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	But has any of the documents that you turned over, to your knowledge, been turned over to the committee?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Mr. Kent, following the July 25 call, and through the first two weeks of August, were you involved in any efforts to arrange for President Zelensky to make a statement announcing the two investigations that the president, President Trump had talked about in the July 25 call?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor, were you involved in any such efforts?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	I want to show you a text of the exchange. This one is between Ambassador Volker and Andrea Yermack, the same day that Volker texted, before the July 25 call. You weren’t involved with it, so I’ll read it.
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	The first text is from August 10, Ambassador Volker text, “I agree with your approach. Let’s iron out the statement and use that to get date and PreZ can go forward with it? Then at 5:42, Mr. Yermack responds, “Once we have a date, we’ll call for a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for a reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling investigations.
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Andrea Yermack says that “Once we have a date, they will announce the investigations and Burisma and election meddling.” Mr Kent, are these the same two investigations President Trump asked the Ukrainian President to initiate in the July 25 call?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Mr Kent, as the day-to-day state department point person in Washington on Ukraine policy, were you aware of this effort to persuade President Zelensky to issue a statement in order to get a White House meeting while they were happening?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	When did you learn about them?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Ambassador Taylor, as the point person on the ground in Ukraine, were you aware of this effort to get Ukraine to issue this written statement in early August?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	The entire discussion about a public statement about the two investigation President Trump wanted was done in what you have described as an irregular channel involving Ambassadors Sondland and Volker. And they tasked to take on Ukraine Policy by the President. Isn’t that correct, Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	Ambassador?
2019-11-13	Mike Quigley	D-Quigley	Democrat	And, I guess to close, a primer on hearsay, I think the American public needs reminded that countless people have been convicted on hearsay, because the courts have routinely allowed and created needed exceptions to hearsay. Hearsay can be much better evidence than direct as we have learned in painful instances. And it’s certainly valid in this instance-
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Ambassador, I want to tell you I have a great deal of respect for what you do. I serve on the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee. I’ve worked with the Native Parliamentary Assembly, including being its president and I know the complexity of of what you do. I know you have little access directly to decision makers, little resources, but you have still a great deal of responsibility. It’s a complex task, and I want to take us from just the concept of one dimensional Ukraine being corrupt to the other issues that you had to deal with as the Ukraine ambassador.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	You had to deal with more than just our bilateral relationship with the Ukraine. For example, and I’d like confirmation that obviously I know you know these, but these were on portfolio. You had to deal with the issue of the OSCE Budapest agreement, and the denuclearization of Ukraine, and the issues of its territorial integrity of the signatories. Correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	The OSCE, the Organization for Security and Cooperation for Europe, and the Budapest agreement, under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons and believed they had its territorial integrity guaranteed by the United States and Russia. You would have had that in your portfolio.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	… Was an issue you would have to do with Ukrainian zones.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Excellent. NATO. Ukraine is an aspiring NATO country, and of course, you have the Bucharest Summit, where the US and the NATO allies made a statement that they would get membership. That would have been on your portfolio. They would have been discussing with you their-
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	And it’s also consistent with us policy that the US supports Ukraine joining the EU, and they have a great deal of interest and desire for joining the EU, correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	And they just had a summit in Ukraine in July, where they talked about the associated agreement on economic integration between the Ukraines and the EU, and they also had a discussion about the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the blocking by Russia of the Ukrainian sailors that came out of the Azov Sea and that were captured. Those would have all been issues that would have been in your portfolio, and that were consistent with what the EU’s issues are, correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	In addition to Ukraine, you’d have to work with France and UK and Germany, all of which who have different ideas of those. The ambassadors to the Ukraine, of France, Germany, and … Correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Some of them, yes.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	You’d have to work with NGOs, non-governmental organizations, on issues that we heard about: legal aid, human trafficking, building democratic institutions. And even HIV/AIDS, right?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	And you’ve spoken at several NGOs while you were the ambassador to Ukraine.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Now, the US ambassador to the EU, they would have under their portfolio aspiring nations to the EU, would they not?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Okay, so EU Ambassador Sondland then would’ve had Ukraine in his portfolio because they’re an aspiring nation and he’s our ambassador to the EU, correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	But you agree that it’s within his portfolio, correct?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	You would agree that’s in his portfolio, would you not? Yes.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Yes. Thank you. Now, I want to go to the next one-
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	… because I’m about out of time.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Holbrooke is a gentleman who have an great deal of reverence for-
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Not on my time. You’re done.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	I’ll take your additional answer. It’s still in his portfolio, which was my question. You knew of Ambassador Holbrooke probably? I did. He’s a man of great integrity. One of our most successful ambassadors. You know him probably by his reputation. You would agree that he was a man of great reputation, right?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Yes. Madam Ambassador, would it surprise you if in 2004 John Kerry had a member of his campaign who was a foreign policy advisor who traveled to the Ukraine in July and met with Ukrainian officials and the US ambassador. Would that surprise you? A member of John Kerry’s campaign team for President of the United States in 2004 traveled to Ukraine, met with the US ambassador in July.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Would you have taken that meeting? If a member of John Kerry’s campaign traveled to the Ukraine, would you have taken that meeting?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Well, that meeting actually occurred, and it was with John Holbrooke. John Holbrooke was a private citizen, traveled to Ukraine, met with the US ambassadors, met with Ukrainian officials. He was also there about HIV/AIDS, which was in addition to something that The Clinton Foundation was working on. So we have a official of the John Kerry campaign 2004 as a private citizen meeting with our Ambassador in Ukraine.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Is that unusual?
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	It probably wasn’t unusual for Giuliani to be there-
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	I have a unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman, that doesn’t involve you this time. It’s three articles, New York Times article, 2004 campaign the advisers Kerry foreign policy crew has a Clintonian look.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Kiev Post, Holbrooke to visit Kiev, July, 2004. [crosstalk 01:39:37].
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	… Organization. I’d like to have that unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman.
0201-11-15	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Mr. Chairman-
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Thank you. Ambassador Volker. Mr. Morrison. Good to see you again. I appreciate your service to your country and your service in government. Our country is safer today because of the work of both of you men. I want you to know that during all the testimony that we’ve had, no one has ever alleged that either of you have done anything inappropriate or improper. And everyone has spoken of both of you as having a high level of professionalism, and a high degree of ethical standards. Ambassador Volker, I appreciated in your opening statement, your comments of your work to focus on Russia as an invasion of Ukraine and occupation, and your work on legal defensive arms. That would include the Javelins would it not, Ambassador Volker?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	And that made a big difference to the Ukrainians, did it not?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Mr. Morrison, tell us about your military service.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Where did you go to law school?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Now gentlemen, there’s been a lot of talk about a lot of people, and we’re going to pick up the pace here, because these are short periods of time that we have now for this portions of questions. A lot of people talking about their perceptions, their beliefs, their feelings even, what they heard and their understandings and their thoughts. Ambassador Taylor, Mr. Kent, Ambassador Yovanovitch, and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman all had conversations with each other, and with other people and all had a whole bunch of hearsay. But I can assure you this boils down to just one thing. This is an impeachment inquiry concerning the president of the United States.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	So the only thing that matters besides all these people talking to each other and all their feelings and all of their thoughts and understandings, it really only comes down to what did the President of the United States intend, and what did he say and what did the Ukrainians understand or hear? Ambassador Volker, you’re one of the first people that we’ve had in these open public testimony that’s had conversations with both. So I get to ask you, you had a meeting with the President of United States, and you believe that the policy issues that he raised concerning Ukraine were valid, correct?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Did the President of United States ever say to you that he was not going to allow aid from the United States to go to the Ukraine unless there were investigations into Burisma, the Bidens or the 2016 elections?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Did the Ukrainians ever tell you that they understood that they would not get a meeting with the President of the United States, a phone call with the President of United States, military aid or foreign aid from the United States unless they undertook investigations of Burisma, the Bidens or the 2016 elections?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Pretty much Ambassador Volker, you just took apart their entire case. I mean, if the President of United States does not believe or intend it, and the Ukrainians don’t understand it, and you’re the only one who actually stands in between them. Now I ask if Ambassador Volker, the three amigo thing or whatever that they’re trying to disparage you with, you’re not part of an irregular channel, right, Ambassador Volker, aren’t you the official channel?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Explain that. Explain how you’re the official channel and not an irregular channel.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Excellent. Great descriptor. I’m going to cut you off there. Ambassador Volker, you are also one of the few people who had actually spoken to Giuliani, the so called irregular channel. Again, all these other people had feelings and understandings about what Giuliani was doing. Did Giuliani ever tell you that United States aid or a meeting with the President of the United States would not occur for the Ukrainians until they agreed to an investigation of Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Excellent. So I would assume then that the Ukrainians never told you that Giuliani had told them that in order to get a meeting with the president, a phone call with the president, military aid or foreign aid from the United States, that they would have to do these investigations.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Okay. Mr. Morrison, you testified that you spoke to Ambassador Sondland, and he told you of a conversation that he had with the President of the United States. On page 128 of his testimony, he relates the content of a conversation that he had with the president, and he was asked about it. It’s the only one he relates, and he said, he was asked whether or not there was a quid pro quo. He said, I didn’t frame the question basically to the president that way as a link, I did not frame the question that way. I asked the open ended question, what do you want?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	This is Mr. Sondland in his testimony asking this question to the President of the United States. And this is what he reports that the President of the United States. He said, “I want nothing. I don’t want to give them anything, I don’t want anything from them. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.” That’s what he, and he kept repeating. “No quid pro quo.” Over and over again. Mr. Morrison, do you have any reason to believe that Mr Sondland is not telling the truth as the content of his conversation with the President of the United States?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Now, do either of you have any information or evidence that anyone who has testified before this committee, either in the secret dungeon testimonies that have been released, or in these open testimonies has perjured themselves or his lied to this committee?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Mr. Morrison.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Mr. Morrison, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman reported to you, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Now you have a legal background. He said that he listened to the phone call, phone call which you said you saw nothing that had occurred illegally, and he said that he believed the President of the United States demanded to President Zelensky that these investigations move forward. Do you believe, because he only was telling us his opinion. Do you believe in your opinion that the President of United States demanded that President Zelensky undertake these investigations?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	To both of you, Ukraine is an aspirant to the EU. Ambassador Sondland is the ambassador to the EU. Is the Ukraine in the ambassador’s portfolio? Ambassador Volker?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Mr. Morrison.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	I yield back.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	I yield my time to Jim Jordan.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Ambassador Volker on Daily Mail they currently have this headline. It says Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker walks back his closed door testimony and says he “has now learned there was a link between U.S. military aid and a Biden probe”. That’s not your testimony today, is it?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Thank you, I yield back.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Ms. Williams. Lt. Col. Vindman. I want to thank you also for your service. Your knowledge and expertise is incredibly important as we look to formulating policy with both our allies and to try to counter those who are not our allies. I think we’re all very concerned about our European policy and how it can thwart Russian aggression.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Ms. Williams, and you are responsible, as you said as part of your portfolio, you advised the vice president about Ukraine. Correct?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Lt. Col. Vindman, you said that you are the principal… In your opening, you say you are the principal advisor to the president on Ukraine and you coordinate US-Ukraine policy. Correct?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	But your statement as you submitted it and read it today says, “At the NSC, I am the principal advisor to the national security advisor and the president on Ukraine.” Correct?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	But you wrote this? You wrote what I just read?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Okay. Noted. Because you know Ukraine, you know that we work through our allies and our multilateral relations and you know that the Ukraine is aspiring member of the EU and NATO. Right, Ms. Williams?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Lt. Col. Vindman?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	And you know that probably that the EU and NATO both have offices in the Ukraine and that we tried to advance our policy with the EU and NATO. And you would agree that our ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison and ambassador Sondland would be responsible for advancing our policy interest with Ukraine at the EU and at NATO. Right, Ms. Williams?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Right. Lt. Col. Vindman, you would agree?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Great. Now Lt. Col., you said in your written statement, that mayor Rudolph Giuliani promoted false information that undermined the United States-Ukraine policy. Have you ever met Giuliani?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	And so you’ve never had a conversation with him about Ukraine, or been in a meeting with him where he has spoken to others about Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	So news reports?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	And similarly, you’ve never met the president of the United States, right?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	So you’ve never advised the president of the United States on Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	But you’ve never spoken to the president of the United States and told him advice on Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	So in your written statement, you said, “In May, I attended the inauguration of president Zelensky as part of the president delegation led by secretary Perry. Following the visit, the members of the delegation provided president Trump a debriefing.” Well, that’s not really accurate, right? Because the members didn’t, because you were a member, but you weren’t in that meeting, were you?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Okay, so we’ll just have a note there that that meeting occurred without you. You do know that this impeachment inquiry is about the president of the United States, don’t you Lt. Col. Vindman?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Great. Excellent. Now you’ve said that you’re responsible for coordinating US-Ukrainian policy.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Does the secretary of state, Pompeo report to you?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Ambassador Volker?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Ambassador of Ukraine, EU, NATO, assistant secretary for Europe, anyone at DOD report to you with respect to your responsibilities of coordinating US policy with Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Does anybody need your approval in your role on Ukraine policy to formulate Ukraine policy? Do they seek your approval?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	So he gets to do it?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	He should do it?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Ms. Williams, do you have any information that any person who has testified as part of this impeachment inquiry, either in secret, or in public, has either perjured themselves, or lied to this committee?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	So you do not. Do you have any evidence though that they have perjured themselves, or lied?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Lt. Col. Vindman, do you have any evidence that anyone who has testified before this committee in the impeachment inquiry has perjured themselves, or lied to this committee?
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Thank you. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Mike Turner	R-Turner	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. First of all, Ms. Williams, let me thank you for your service to our nation. It it truly matters.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	With President Zelensky. You said the President said, “I would like you to do me a favor,” but that is inaccurate. It was finally clear in that colloquy, and I’m going to read it to you. I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	One of you said, well, that’s because the President is using royal we. Here the President’s talking about the country. That’s what he’s talking about. It’s audacious to say it’s using the royal we. That’s royal all right, but it ain’t the royal we. And I’ll just tell you, when you come in with a preconceived notion, it’s becomes obvious. One of you just said, Mr. Feldman, you, it was you who said, and I’m going to quote here roughly. I think this is exactly what you said, though. “Until the call on July 25th, I was an impeachment skeptic too.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	I don’t know. I’m looking at an August 23rd, 2017 publication where you said if President Donald Trump pardons Joe Arpaio, it would be an impeachable offense. He did ultimately pardon him. In 2017 the New York Review of Books, Professor Feldman said defamation by tweet is an impeachable offense.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And I think of the history of this country, and I think if defamation or libel or slander is an a impeachable offense, I can’t help but reflect about John Adams, about Thomas Jefferson who routinely pilloried their political opponents. In fact, at the time, the factions or parties actually bought newspapers to attack their political opponents. So this rather expansive and generous view you have on what constitutes impeachment is a real problem.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	This morning one of you mentioned the Constitutional Convention, and several of you mentioned Mr. Davies, and you’ve talked about the Constitutional Convention and it’s been a while since I read the minutes, so I just briefly reviewed, because I remembered the discussion on the impeachment as being more pervasive, a little bit more expanded.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And on July 20th, 1787… It wasn’t 1789 by the way, one you testified it was 1789. It was in 1787, July 20th, Benjamin Franklin is discussing impeachment of a Dutch leader and he talks specifically about what he would anticipate an impeachment to look like. He said it would be a regular and peaceable inquiry that would have taken place, and if guilty, then there’d be a punishment. If acquitted, then the innocent would be restored to the confidence of the public. That needs to be taken to account as well.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	So I look also at a May 17th, 2017 BBC article, which is a discussion about impeachment, because President Trump had fired James Comey. Alex Whiting of Harvard said it was hard to make the obstruction of justice case with this sacking alone. The President had clear legal authority and there was arguably proper or at least other reasons put forward for firing him. And yet what we have here is this insistence by Mr. Gerhardt that that was impeachable. That’s contained in that article. Refer you to it. May 17th, 2017 BBC.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	What I’m suggesting to you today is a reckless bias coming in here. You’re not fact witnesses. You’re supposed to be talking about what the law is, but you came in with a preconceived notion and bias.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And I want to read one last thing here, if I can find it, from one of our witnesses here, and it’s dealing with something that was said in a Maryland Law Review article in 1999. And basically if I can get to it, he’s talking about this being critical of lack of self doubt and an overwhelming arrogance on the part of law professors who come in and opine on impeachment. That would be you, Mr. Gerhardt, who said something like that. I can’t find my quote or else I’d give it to you.
2019-12-04	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And so what I’m telling you is that is what has been on display in this committee today. And with that I yield back.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Point of order, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, last week, you were furnished with a proper demand for minority hearing pursuant to clause 2J1 of rule 11. In a blatant and egregious violation of the rules you are refusing to schedule that hearing. Therefore, I insist on my point of order unless you are willing to immediately schedule a minority hearing day.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	It’s not to be considered, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, pardon my inquiry.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, what is-
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, point of inquiry.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, point of order.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yes, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman-
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Is Mr. Berke a member of the committee?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a legitimate point of order.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Point of order, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yes. The point of order is this. We operate by rules and if there’s nothing specifically in the rule permitting this, we go by precedent. It is unprecedented for a person to come and sit, who you’ve described as a witness to then return to the bench and begin questioning.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	That is a point of order.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Castor, what’s direct evidence?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And what’s hearsay evidence?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Right. And under the federal rules of evidence adopted by most days hearsay is inadmissible unless the testimony falls under defined exceptions. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And I believe you were present when every witness testified including Mr. Solomon. Right?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And that’s a yes?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And much of the Democrats important impeachment narrative is based on the Sondland testimony, is that a fair characterization?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	How many times Mr. Sondland mentioned in the Intel Committee’s report?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yeah. And just to refresh your mind, Sondland himself told the world that basically nobody else on the planet told him that Donald Trump was trying to aid to investigations. In fact, he also said everything that he’d been testifying to is simply his presumptions. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And so when we consider what a presumption is, it’s not direct. It’s not circumstantial. It’s not even hearsay. In fact, we typically, when we’re trying a case, we consider it as speculation. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Do courts allow speculation in?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Why not?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	It’s inherently unreliable. So can you name any Democrat witness who asserted that he or she had direct evidence of those 17 that we heard from?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	How about with regard to a personal knowledge of the quid pro quo allegation?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	How about tying aid to investigations?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	How about political motives and asking for investigations?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	In the non-legalistic world when we talk about speculation, we typically think use words like gossip, rumor, innuendo. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And isn’t it true that the only direct evidence that we have is that Ukraine received the aid without giving anything in return? President Zelensky has repeatedly stated no pressure, no problem with the phone call and the relationship with Mr. Trump, and that the president had a legitimate concern about Ukraine corruption.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	So much has been made about the alleged desire for an announcement of an investigation. But again, there is no direct evidence that supports the allegation that president Trump wanted merely the announcement of an investigation.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	And everything else is hearsay, innuendo, rumor, rumor, gossip, right?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yeah. So when we get into this event today in the process, we start talking about the process. Were you surprised to see Mr. Burke get out of his chair, move to the seat and sit down next to the chairman and start asking questions?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yeah. Well, I’ll tell you I was, and it looks like Mr. Burke has been disappeared. And so that’s one of the outrageous things about this process and it’s been outrageous from start to finish. We’ve seen prejudice and bias against the president from start to finish. We have the lion’s share, almost two-thirds of the members of the Democrats have already voted to impeach at least once. And that’s before anything with regard to this July 25th telephone conversation ever took place. And we’re left with a constant view that as on November 9th, 2016 Representative Green from Texas wanted to begin impeachment proceedings at that point. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	January 20th, 2017, Washington Post headline Let the Impeachment begin, is that correct?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	10 days later, Mr. Zaid, who is the attorney for the whistleblower, tweeted out, “Let the impeachment begin, let the coup begin, and victory to the lawyers.” Is that right?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yeah. We had people who on this committee came out today and they went on TV and said, “We wanted to start impeachment earlier, but the speaker held us back.” Did you see that?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yeah.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yeah. You wouldn’t be surprised about that though, would you?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	No. Nobody should be surprised about that because this is a sham hearing three years that they’ve been trying to remove this president and this is the culmination of a predetermined outcome. That’s where we are today. And so with that we bring it back to the same points. No pressure, no conditionality, and all of the aid, meetings, calls, were received by the Ukrainians. With that I yield back.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	I don’t have anything.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	A lot of people are moving from California to Texas.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a unanimous consent request. Or Madam Chairman-
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Madam Chairman?
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Or just, it’ll be very brief. It’s just unanimous consent.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Okay.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Madam Chair, you indicated to me that you would allow me to make my uniform consent after you had asked your questions, so I’d ask for uniform consent. Or excuse me, unanimous consent to introduce two letters-
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have two letters addressed to you on December 4, 2019, and one December 5th, 2019.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Thank you.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, brief parliamentary inquiry about the schedule.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman, point of order. Mr. Chairman, I have a unanimous consent. I have a unanimous consent.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have the unanimous consent.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Yes. Mr. Chairman, I asked for the admission of the document entitled “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire,” dated January 11th, 2017.
2019-12-09	Andy Biggs	R-Biggs	Republican	Should I make a motion to insert instead, Mr. Chairman?
2019-11-21	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you both for being here. You know, in 1998, I voluntarily joined the United States Army Reserve because I saw our country under attack time and time again. Bill Clinton was the president. I didn?t vote for Bill Clinton, but he was my commander in chief. It didn?t matter that I didn?t vote for him. I was grateful to live in a country that gets to legitimately elect our leaders.
2019-11-21	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	I?ve been to places where people don?t get to, and it?s not pretty. And I respect our system, and I accept the results that are determined by the American people. I deployed to Iraq, 2005, 2006, as an Army surgeon with soldiers from many backgrounds. The most important thing was we were all Americans. That was first and foremost. In our mission, we treated our troops, we treated the enemy, winning over the hearts and minds of people that never knew us because of their dictator, Saddam Hussein, who told them that we were responsible for all their problems. That was his narrative.
2019-11-21	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And speaking of narratives, Dr. Hill, I?m sorry. I have to say this. You said based on statements you?ve heard that some in this committee believe Russia did not conduct a campaign against our country is false. That?s Mr. Schiff?s narrative. That?s where you?ve heard it. We did a whole report on it, and we agree that Russia has done this since the Soviet Union and they?ve actually gotten better at it. That?s a problem. But at the same time, certain Ukrainians did work against candidate Trump, some with the DNC. And if that?s debunked, why is it Mr. Schiff has denied DNC operative Alexandra Chalupa from testifying to come forward and debunk it?
2019-11-21	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	I ask America, ?Was it good for the country, for the DNC and the Clinton campaign, to pay Christopher Steele to dig up fake dirt with other foreign service sources on their political rival?? Was it good for America to claim having evidence of the president colluding with Russians when he did not, costing the taxpayer millions and being debunked by special counsel? I?d say the false narrative got caught.
2019-11-21	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Was it good for the country, for Americans and foreigners alike, to attempt to entrap members of the United States presidential campaign, specifically the Trump campaign? Sadly, I?ve come to believe through all this that some in power do think it?s good. They think it?s okay. And now we?re here in an impeachment proceeding, certainly a right that Congress has, and apparently even with very partisan rules. But I?m curious. This impeachment inquiry was announced by the Speaker before the whistleblower complaint was even out. I?m curious why the lawyer for the whistleblower announced that the coup to impeach the president, he announced that right after Trump won. That?s pretty damning.
2019-11-21	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	I know it hurts after losing an election, especially as Americans. We usually get over it. And I imagine it would hurt even more if you were promised a position in the next administration and lost, and your hopes and your dreams are dashed. You know, I?ve seen hatred for political reasons, specifically on June 14th, 2017, at a ball field in Virginia. I?ve seen hatred in war, and I know that hatred blinds people. I?ve been in war, and I?ve studied war, and coups create division. And it?s time for this phase of the publicly announced and proclaimed Democrat coup to end. Thank you for your service. Thanks for being here, and I yield back.
2019-11-21	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	I yielded back. [crosstalk 01:33:10] answer the question.
2019-11-21	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	[crosstalk 01:33:14] statement.
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Ambassador, thank you very much for being here, and I just want to start by saying I appreciate your years of service and enduring years of moving around the world to dangerous places. And hearing from you today, I realized that we share some of the same feelings and experiences.
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	As an army reserve surgeon, I received a call on a Monday afternoon in March of 2005 that told me I was being deployed to Iraq and I had to be out the door in the next two to three days. I had patients scheduled for months. I had surgeries scheduled and had to get … So I understand that shocking feeling that can come with some abrupt change like that. And I was at processing a few days later, and I was told my orders would say you’re going for 18 months, but it may be a little shorter than that.
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	But I served a year in Iraq, 2005, 2006. One of the bloodiest times of the war, and this is where I have another personal relationship with what you were talking about. I saw a nation in Iraq of people that craved a non-corrupt government, and sadly today, even though it helped to remove Saddam Hussein, they still have corruption concerns in Iraq, and I can relate to what you said just a few moments ago that it feels like an open wound when it hasn’t been resolved.
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	But you might imagine with that military experience and background, I take an interest in military strategy and capabilities, and the thoughts of those with boots on the ground, like you and Mr. Volker, and Mr. Taylor. In your deposition on page 144, you’re quoted as saying “In terms of lethal assistance, we all felt it was very significant that this administration made the decision to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine.” Just real quick, who in general makes up ‘we all?’ Would that be the team I mentioned?
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Well, I have to move on. You said “We all felt it was very significant that this administration made the decision to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine.” I assume that as those that have boots on the ground, and then ‘this administration,’ I assume you meant the Trump Administration.
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Yeah, okay. In your deposition also on page 144, you spoke about the generosity of Congress. You mentioned it today. Increasing aid to Ukraine. And part of your deposition after that statement that I quoted before you asked, did you advocate for that? You responded yes. And then you were asked, “Did you advocate for that prior to the new administration in 2016,” and you responded “Well, yeah.” On page 148, the question was “Were you satisfied that the administration was doing what was necessary to support Ukraine?” You said, “In what respect?” And they said in, “In, you know, helping them deter Russian aggression, helping them with foreign aid and foreign assistance,” and you said, “Yeah.
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And I agree that that lethal assistance was very significant, as you said. And I thank you for that. And I thank Mr. Volker, and I thank Mr. Taylor.
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Acting Ambassador Taylor was here Wednesday. He testified about the President’s decision to withhold lethal aid, and he said the President felt it might provoke Russia. And Mr. Taylor contested then that Russia has already been provoked, and they have invaded the Ukraine. President Obama had the right to make his own foreign policy and make his own decisions as President of the United States, correct?
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	But he has the right as President … I respect the inter-agency process. I’m getting to that actually. But he has the right to make his own foreign policy and make his own decisions as President of the United States, as do all presidents, correct?
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	So we have one president, Obama, who denied lethal aid altogether in spite of ambassadors and other boots on the ground recommending, making that recommendation, such as you did. We have another president, Trump, who vetted those that were going to receive the aid, and provided it consistent with your inter agency recommendations, and that of your colleagues. Let me just ask you, from a military standpoint, without Javelins, would you agree the Russians had much greater military offensive options and flexibility in their effort to attack the Ukraine without the Ukraine having Javelins?
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	But I’m just saying with the Javelin-
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And there’s a reason for that, because the Javelins are there. And so I think that that changes the scenario, but I just wanted to make that point that the President has a right to have their own foreign policy, and to make their own decisions. And with that, I yield back.
0201-11-15	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Well, I wasn’t asking you about that, but thank you very much, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Okay, gentlemen, thank you very much for being here. I want to start, if I can, with you, Mr. Morrison. In discussing the 7/25 phone call and the concerns that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman had, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman came to you with edits for the transcript. And you stated that you accepted all of his edits. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Did he come to you with an edit that said that the word “demand” should be in there?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	He didn’t either. How soon after the phone call did he meet with you on that particular issue?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	That same day. So today, he said, “I reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg. It is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a US citizen and political opponent.” Now, he was going to Mr. Eisenberg with his concerns about the conversation, yet he did not, at any point on the edits, say that there should be a demand. And he didn’t do that, but he did say that he didn’t come to you with his concerns because you weren’t available. But that same day, he came to you with edits. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Okay. Well, he said you weren’t available, and you didn’t hear the president make a demand, did you?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	So sometime between the call and today, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman must’ve been hearing some voices, and he heard “demand” at the time. But he didn’t hear it that day, and he didn’t make it an issue that day. But today, he does. I think that’s pretty bizarre. When Lieutenant Colonel Vindman went to legal, Mr. Eisenberg, do you know if he was advised not to speak to you?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Do you know if he was advised to contact the IGIC?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	So you don’t know what he was advised when he went to legal?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Thank you. I appreciate that. Mr. Volker, I want to tell you, I’ve really enjoyed your opening testimony today, taking us through that. I know it was kind of long, but I thought it was extremely well done. And I appreciate it. You talk about letter signed and sharing concerns about leadership in your assigned country, about agreeing with and sometimes disagreeing with the leadership of your own country when you felt it was appropriate. You’re the boots on the ground for the administration. Let’s face it. You’re part of that team that is there to serve the country in that way. And that all to me sounded like the works of a very good diplomat, and I want to thank you for that.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	It’s truly appreciated. And corruption was a concern, legitimately, in Ukraine and in many ways. And Mr. Jordan pointed out some of the things that were done by Ukrainians in plain sight … I might use that term, “in plain sight” … by putting op-eds in our newspapers. And it’s certainly more than one country can be trying to influence our elections. Would you agree with that?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And we keep hearing that that whole thing about Ukrainians, that’s all been debunked. It was just the Russians. Well, that comes from an IC community that some of the people that have come up with those conclusions are some of the very same people that we’re going to find out, if we haven’t already, were deeply involved with this whole Russian collusion hoax.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	But I want to say you did a great job. You vetted Zelensky’s intentions, what he intended to be as a president. Would you say that’s accurate?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And that’s what your job should be, and you became comfortable with this president, correct?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And you work to assure our president that you comfortable with this president.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And in some ways, you have to work sometimes through any means available. And that might include working with Rudy Giuliani if it could be helpful to you to get that message and advice to the president. Would that be correct?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And in that, I think, you termed that a useful barometer of where things were.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	So those useful barometers, I think, can come in a lot of different fashions, like Dennis Rodman in North Korea or James Taylor in France singing You’ve Got a Friend, if they can help the cause. And in that situation, it’s not illegal. Good job, Ambassador. Thank you very much.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	I yield back.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, thank you very much for being here. As an army colonel who served a year in Iraq, I appreciate your service and the sacrifice that you made during that time, and I know the environment. And I understand and appreciate the importance of chain in command. In your deposition, you emphasize the importance of chain in command. You were a direct report to Dr. Fiona Hill and then Mr. Tim Morrison, and they were your seniors, correct?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	When you had concerns about the 7/25 call between the two presidents, you didn’t go to Mr. Morrison about that, did you?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	So that doesn’t seem like chains of command. [crosstalk 00:00:39] In the deposition with-
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	… page 58 to 60.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Okay, thank you.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Well, he did avail himself, and I’ll get into that.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Okay. In the Morrison Deposition, on page 58-60, the question was, “Do you know if anyone else on the call went to Eisenberg to express concerns,” and the answer was, “I learned, based on today’s proceedings, based on open-source reporting, which I have no firsthand knowledge if other personnel did raise concerns.” Question, “Who?” Based on open-source, without firsthand knowledge, Alex Vindman, on my staff, the question then, “And he reports to you, correct?” Answer, “He does.” Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s direct report was Mr. Morrison and it didn’t happen. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, in your deposition, page 96, the question was, “Okay, after the call on 7/25, do you have any discussions with Mr. Morrison about your concerns?” Answer, “After the call, I, well, per the, per the exercise in the chain of command and expressing, I immediately went to the senior NSC legal counsel and shared those concerns.” That would be Mr. Eisenberg, correct?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	You went to Mr. Eisenberg. You’ve already said that, so we can go on. And you are not a JAG officer, you’re not a lawyer. And on page 153 of your testimony, deposition, in reference to that meeting with Mr. Eisenberg, you said, “I was not making a legal judgment. All I was doing is sharing my concerns with my chain of command,” yet we’ve established that your direct report is to Mr. Morrison. So let’s establish your role and your title. In your deposition, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, page 200, 201, in a colloquy with Mr. Stewart, you said, “I would say first of all, I’m the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable, for the national security council and the White House.” Are you the only one of the entire universe of our government or otherwise that can advise the president on Ukraine? Couldn’t someone like Mrs. Williams also advise on Ukraine? It’s in her portfolio.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	So other people can advise on Ukraine besides you? Going on in your testimony, you said, “I understand all the nuances, the context, and so forth surrounding these issues. I, on my judgment, went. I expressed concerns within the chain of command, which I think, to me, as a military officer, is completely appropriate. And I exercised that chain of command.” Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, on your deposition, page 259, you said, “I forwarded my concerns through the chain of command, and the seniors then decide the action to take.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Mr. Morrison’s your senior. He didn’t know about it. How can he decide an action to take, but that’s what you said. In Mr. Morrison’s deposition, page 60, the question is, “At what point did you learn that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman went to Eisenberg?” He said, “About the 25th phone call?” He said, “Yes.” “In the course of reviewing for this proceeding, reviewing the open record.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	The next question, “So Eisenberg never came to you and relayed to you the conversation?” He said, “No.” He said, “And Ellis never did either?” “Not to the best of my recollection.” So Mr. Morrison was skipped in your chain of command about your other concerns. Mr. Morrison said he’s the final clearing authority. He said he saw your edits. Do you remember if all of the edits were incorporated? And he said, “Yes, I accepted all of them.” That’s on page 61, 62.
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	He believes all your edits were accepted. Let me ask, in your edits, did you insist that the word demand be put into the transcription between the conversation of the two presidents?
0201-11-19	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	But you did say that in your opening statement today. Thank you, and I yield back.
2019-11-13	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Taylor, this should be easy because I’m going to use a lot of your words from the previous deposition as we go forward. In your deposition, you spoke of support for Ukraine and its relationship to the United States and how much you support that. In 2014 you, and I’m quoting this, “Urged Obama administration to provide lethal defensive weapons in order to deter further Russian aggression.” Did the Obama administration provide lethal weapons?
2019-11-13	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	They provided MREs and blankets and things like that. In your deposition, you also said President Obama’s objection was because it might provoke the Russians and in fact you testified in your deposition that the Obama administration didn’t have a good argument since Russia had already provoked and they have invaded Ukraine. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	It’s a shame he didn’t take the advice of a combat veteran like you sir. Someone who understands what deterrence provides because a lot of Ukrainian lives could’ve been saved if he had taken your advice. In your deposition, you said, and I quote happy, you were “Happy with Trump administration’s assistance.” And it provided both lethal and financial aid. Did it not?
2019-11-13	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	And you also stated that it was a substantial improvement. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	So now we’re providing Javelins which kill Russian tanks. MREs and blankets do not do that. Today you said, “I was beginning to fear that the longstanding U.S. policy of strong support for Ukraine was shifting.” I have a little trouble with longstanding based on what we just talked about, because it wasn’t really longstanding strong support. It seems to me the strong support came with this administration. Would you agree with that, sir? Unless you consider MREs and blankets strong support. I wouldn’t call it longstanding.
2019-11-13	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Well certainly that strong support came from Congress.
2019-11-13	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	But it didn’t come from the previous administration as compared to what this administration has decided to do. The strong support came with this administration, not the Obama administration. And maybe now we understand what President Obama meant when he told Russian president Medvedev that he’d have more flexibility after his election. Maybe that flexibility was to deny lethal aid to the Ukraine, allowing Russia to March right in and kill Ukrainians. Again in your deposition, you urged the Obama administration officials to provide lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine in order to deter further Russian aggression. And now they have that under this administration, don’t they, Mr. Ambassador?
2019-11-13	Brad Wenstrup	R-Wenstrup	Republican	Thank you-
2019-11-21	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Thank you. Dr. Hill. Mr. Holmes, thank you for being here. I actually have no questions for you that haven?t already been asked or made any points that haven?t already been made. And I guess I?ll just conclude by something I?ve said before. This Impeach-a-Palooza tour finally comes to an end. A year of resistance, two and a half years of these absurd accusations against the president of Russia and collusion. We?ve gone from quid pro quo to bribery to extortion, seven weeks of hearings, 16 secret closed-door sessions, 12 public hearings, now of which you are the last, hundreds of hours of testimony. And I really think that for those who hate the president, they haven?t changed their minds, but there?s a lot of Americans who look at this and they think, ?Is that it? Really? You?re going to impeach and remove a president for this?
2019-11-21	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Now, like I said, if you don?t like the president, you?ve already come to that conclusion. Many people wanted this three years ago. But for a lot of Americans, they really look at that, and they can see this. No evidence, zero evidence of any bribery, zero evidence of extortion, zero evidence firsthand of any quid pro quo, and yet impeachment is almost inevitable. And why? Because the leadership of this committee has been unfair and dishonest. And I know we hear these crocodile tears from some of my colleagues who are heartbroken because they finally have to impeach this president, and we know that?s absurd. There?s no heartbroken. There?s no prayerful tears over this. They?re giddy over this. And there?s not a person in the country who doesn?t know that. Everyone knows what they?re going to do next. They?re going to impeach the president, and they?re going to send it onto the Senate. But that is the good news. That?s good news.
2019-11-21	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	We?ve all been to a concert. You got the warm-up band, and then you got the main act. And what we?ve seen here is the warm-up band. This is kind of like the Sioux City Crooners. This is a band that no one?s ever heard of, but the warm-up band is over, and now we?re going to go on to the main event, and that?s in the U.S. Senate.
2019-11-21	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	In the U.S. Senate, there won?t be any secret testimony. There?s not going to be dishonest leadership for a chairman who refuses to let us ask appropriate questions or to deny a defense. Where in the world, where in the country do you have a trial where the prosecution presents their case and the defense isn?t able to. We?ll finally be able to get to the truth.
2019-11-21	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I?m talking now to my colleagues in the Senate. These are some of the witnesses that you need to call, and these are some of the questions that you need to ask. First ,you have to hear from the whistle blower. Now, they can choose to do that in closed session if they want to. I leave that up to them, but you can?t initiate an impeachment of the President of the United States and not have to answer some questions.
2019-11-21	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Who did he get his information from? Did he have the classification and the clearances to get that information? What?s his relationship with Vice President Biden? Who has he shared that information with, including some members of the committee here? I think our own chairman needs to be called. What interactions did he or his staff have with the whistleblower? Did they help to coordinate or in any way facilitate the complaint? Did they coordinate and facilitate him counsel?
2019-11-21	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	What about Hunter Biden? How did he get his job? What did he do to earn his salary? And here?s the key to this. Look, if he goes there and makes money, knock yourself out. I don?t care. But I want to know, did he have conversations with government officials, and was government policy changed at a particularly high level because of some of those? Devon Archer, former board member from Burisma. Alexandra Chalupa, former DNC official who admitted she provided anti-Trump information to the DNC and to Hillary Clinton. Nellie Ohr from Fusion GPS to help to create the ridiculous Steele dossier.
2019-11-21	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I?d like to remind us what I said yesterday. The American people expect a lot in politics. They understand the tussle, the fight, the debate, but they also expect basic fairness, and these proceedings have been anything but fair. The Senate has an opportunity to fix that. I am confident they will, and I look forward to them completing the job that we could have done here. With that, I will yield back.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman and others. Ambassador, thank you for being with us here today. Welcome, as I said a couple of days ago, to the witnesses. Welcome to year four of the impeachment proceedings. I’m sorry that you’ve gotten drugged into this.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	For three years, we’ve heard these outrageous and frankly unbelievable accusations regarding Russian collusion, accusations that we now know are absolute nonsense, that there was no basis at all despite promises from some members of this committee that they had secret proof that would prove this collusion. And, granted, we know that it was nonsense. But now in year four, we apparently move on to the Ukraine and quid pro quo, culminating yesterday when The Speaker announced that the President would indeed be impeached and removed for office for bribery. And with that statement, I would now feel compelled to ask you, Madam Ambassador, as you sit here before us, very simply and directly, do you have any information regarding the President of the United States accepting any bribes?
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the President of the United States has been involved with at all?
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Thank you. Thank you for answering that directly. The American people know this is nonsense. The American people know this is unfair, and I have a prediction regarding this. I think that public support for impeachment is actually going to be less when these hearings are over than it is when the hearings began because finally the American people are going to be able to see the evidence, and they’re going to be able to make their own determination regarding that.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Now, I want to ask you one thing very quickly, and you’ve been asked this again and again, but my question is slightly different. You’ve been asked as you recognize that the President, any president, has the ability to ask his ambassadors to serve at-will. I’m curious, do you think that’s the right policy?
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I do as well. It may be imperfect. There may be times when it’s not used perfectly, but I agree with you. It is the right policy. I don’t think that we should change that.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Now, I’d like to read from some previous statements, including one of your own as well as others, regarding the appropriateness of investigating corruption in the UK. From Miss Fiona Hill: “So again, the fact that there are investigations into corruption in the energy sector in Ukraine as well as in Russia and many other countries is not a surprise.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	From yourself, your previous testimony: “Question, was it the general understanding that Burisma was a company that suffered from allegations of corruption?” Your answer was “Yes.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	From Ambassador Sondland: “I just am generally aware that Burisma is considered a potentially corrupt company.” Would you agree then that it’s appropriate to investigate corruption?
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Okay.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	And I appreciate that. Regardless of the process though, it’s appropriate for us to investigate potential corruption, and especially … Look, we’re about to give some of these countries hundreds of millions of dollars. That the US taxpayer said, “Here’s a dollar of mine. Go ahead and give it to this other country, but please only do it if you know it’s not going to be used for corrupt purposes or against our national interest.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	And I’ll conclude with this because I promised my friend, Mr. Jordan, I would save him a little bit of time. We mentioned earlier that the Vice President, when he went to the Ukraine and called for the specific firing of a specific prosecutor, that he was, as they say, completing official US policy. But the interesting thing is this, the Vice President had exactly two countries that were his responsibility at that time, China and the Ukraine. And he has bragged and been very proud of his influence in the previous administration. He says again and again that the Obama Administration listened to him, so it doesn’t surprise me that they would be fulfilling a policy that this Vice President certainly helped to formulate.
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Mr. Jordan, I leave you …
0201-11-15	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	In Cyprus. I’m sorry, Cyprus. Thank you. Clarification. And I will yield for unanimous consent.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Thank you, gentlemen. Welcome to Impeachapalooza 2019, which is the Democratic plan to compel America to impeach president Donald J. Trump through the sheer force of boredom because it’s been a long day, and it turns out impeachment is very boring if you don’t have any compelling or any condemning evidence.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Good news and bad news … The good news is I’m going to be very, very brief. We’re going on 10-plus hours of this. I will yield back some of my time. The bad news is, most of my colleagues after me won’t, so we’ve still got some time to go.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Ambassador Volker, very quickly, do you think that someone should be immune from investigation of suspected ethical or criminal activity just because they are a candidate for office, even for office of the president of the United States?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Well, of course not. That would be absurd to suggest that, and I was certain that’s how you would answer that question. What if some of these alleged ethical or criminal allegations occurred overseas, that occurred in another country? Would it be improper to seek the host country’s help, such as we do with Interpol or any other law enforcement agency?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Okay. And again, to seek the host nation’s, their government’s help is not unusual at all, [crosstalk 01:14:01]?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Thank you. Thank you. Again, that’s painfully obvious, and to me, that’s exactly … and the only thing that the president was doing here. Mr. Morrison, I want to refer just briefly to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s testimony where he described the six people … I believe it was five or six people … that were in the situation room listening to this phone call between the two presidents.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Colonel Vindman described these individuals as exceptional. He stated that there was no reason to question their integrity or professionalism. This was an exchange that he and I had in the closed-door testimony. Do you agree with the description of these national security staff as exceptional people?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	People of great integrity and professionalism?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Do any of these … I’m sorry. Did any of these exceptional individuals, people of unquestioned integrity and professionalism, indicate to you that they had thought that the president of the United States engaged in any illegal or unethical behavior as a result of this phone call?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Did any of them suggest to you in any way that they thought the president was involved with bribery or any such thing associated with that?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	It only leaves two possible explanations. Either these individuals of what we’ve described as great integrity … Either that’s not true, which I don’t believe, or they just interpreted an ambiguous conversation very differently than did Colonel Vindman.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	And I have one last thing just as an aside. As an Air Force officer, I’ve never understood why President Obama was against providing lethal aid to the Ukraine. Ambassador, do you have some insight into why they refuse to do that?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I agree with you, Ambassador. I think that you got it right, and I think President Trump got it right. And with that, I yield back.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Thank you Miss Williams, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and thank to both of you for being here today. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I see you’re wearing your dress uniform. Knowing that’s not the uniform of the day, do you normally wear a suit to the White House? I think it’s a great reminder of your military service. I, too, come from a military family. These are my father’s Air Force wings. He was a pilot in World War II. Five of his son served in the military, so as one military family to another, thank you and your brothers for your service. Your example here … Very quickly, I’m curious, when ranking member Nunez referred you as Mr. Vindman, you quickly corrected him and wanted to be called Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. Do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I’m sure he meant no disrespect.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Listen, I’m just telling you that the ranking member meant no disrespect to you.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I’d like to go back to your previous testimony earlier today. Much has been talked about, as we’ve discussed, between the President Trump and President Zelensky, and the word favor, and this being interpreted as a basis for impeachment. And your interpretation of the word favor, and I’ll paraphrase you and you feel free to correct me, you said in the military culture, which you and I are both familiar with, when a superior officer asks for a favor of a subordinate and they will interpret that as a demand. Is that a fair synopsis of what you previously stated?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Okay. In short then, you think your interpretation of a favor as a demand is based on your military experience and the military culture.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I think that is correct. Is President Trump a member of the military?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Has he ever served in the military?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Is President Zelensky a member of the military? The answer’s no.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	He’s not. Would it be fair then to take a person who has never served in the military and to take your reevaluation of their words based on your military experience and your military culture, and to attach that culture and that meaning of those words to someone who has never served?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Okay, well, I got to tell you, I think it’s nonsense. Look, I was in the military. I could distinguish between a favor, and an order, and a demand, and so could my subordinates, and I think President Zelensky did as well. He never initiated an investigation. In fact, he’s been very clear. He said, “I never felt any pressure at all.” So you interpreted the word favor, but the two people who were speaking to each other did not interpret that as a demand. It was your interpretation. Is that fair?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Well that’s not true at all. It’s not clear at all. You say it makes it clear. It’s not clear at all. And the two individuals who were talking to each other didn’t interpret it that way. I’d like to go on to discuss your reaction to the phone call, and again your previous testimony. And for brevity and for clarity I’m going to refer to your previous testimony of page 155. Your attorney’s welcome to follow along. Quoting you, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. “I did not know whether this was a crime or anything of that nature. I thought it was wrong,” and I’d like to key on the word wrong here because we’re going to come back to that, “In my mind did I consider this factor that it could have been other implications. Yes, but it wasn’t the basis of, I don’t know, lodging a criminal complaint or anything like that.” Then you go on to talk about policy concerns and moral and ethical judgements.
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	So, your concerns regarding this phone call were not legal. They were based on moral, ethical, and policy differences. Let me ask you then … And you what you thought were wrong, to use your word. You said this was wrong. Not illegal but wrong. There are, as I’ve stated previous sitting here a couple of days ago, there are dozens of corrupt nations in the world, hundreds of corrupt government officials. Exactly one time did a vice president go to a nation and demand the specific firing of one individual and give a six hour time limit and withhold, or threatened to withhold, $1 billion in aid if not. It was the one individual who was a investigating company that was paying his son. So I’ll ask you was that also wrong?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	You’ve not seen the video?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	That’s all I’ve described is the video. Everything I just said to you was in the video. Was that wrong as well?
0201-11-19	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Well, I think the American people can make a judgment on that, too.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Thank you. To the witnesses, thank you. Time is precious, so I’m going to go very, very quickly.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Welcome, I think, to year four of the ongoing impeachment of President Trump. I’m sorry that you have been dragged into this. I think the sign behind me says it very well, by the whistleblower’s attorney: “The coup has started and impeachment will follow.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	But after listening for what is going on now four hours and 21 minutes, after all of the secret hearings, after all of the leaks, after hearing witnesses such as yourselves give your opinions, it really comes down to this one thing. One thing it comes down to. This is the transcript that the President has released of this phone call. There is one sentence, one phone call. That is what this entire impeachment proceeding is based upon. And I’ve got to tell you, if your impeachment case is so weak that you have to lie and exaggerate about it to convince the American people that they need to remove this President, then you’ve got a problem.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	The American people have been lied to again and again on this. We first heard a lot about quid pro quo. And then many people realized that was meaningless. So, they said, “Let’s go for defenses then. Let’s talk about extortion. Let’s talk about bribery. Let’s talk about cover up and obstruction,” for which there is zero evidence of any of that. We heard a characterization of the President’s phone call that was so outrageously inaccurate it had to be described as a parody. And none of those things matter. None of it matters. It comes down to this.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	"We appreciate your insight, we appreciate your opinion; but all you can do is give your opinion of this. This one phone call."
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Let me ask you, gentlemen: both of you have said here today, you have testified, “Corruption in the Ukraine is endemic.” Would we agree on that?
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Simple question. The problem is … Isn’t it?
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Okay. Earlier in the hearing, both of you said … Used the word “endemic” or agreed to it. It’s in the courts, it’s oligarchs, it’s prosecutors, it’s everywhere. And I think we can also agree that that’s not the only place in the world where we experience and see corruption. There’s dozens and dozens of nations around the world that are steeped in corruption. Would you agree with that?
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Okay, thank you. And some we’re clearly more concerned about than others.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	So, in these corrupt nations, of which there are probably hundreds of corrupt individuals, hundreds of corrupt government officials, can you give me an example of any time where the Vice President of the United States shows up and demands that a specific prosecutor be fired and gives them a six hour time limit to do that? Are you aware of that ever happening in any other place?
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I guess the answer is “no”. And I just think it’s interesting that out of hundreds of corrupt individuals, dozens of corrupt nations, that happened one time. And it happened with the individual whose son was being paid by the organization that was under investigation.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	One other thing very quickly: if someone was a candidate for a political office, even for President of the United States, should they be immune from investigation?
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Thank you. I agree with that. I think we all would agree with that. And yet I think some presume that because some of the individuals we’re talking here were candidates that they are immune from any questions or any investigation. I think it’s absurd. For heaven’s sakes, if those of us in public office, those of us who find ourselves up for reelection or all the time as a candidate, I think we have a higher standard, not immunity from asking these types of questions.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	And last thing, then I’m going to yield my time: “Availability of funds …” I’m quoting from the NDAA in 2019. The language is specific. “Availability of funds under assistance to the Ukraine, it has to be certified.” And what has to be certified? Quote, “For the purposes of decreasing corruption.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	Are you surprised that there would be questions about corruption in the Ukraine and that it would be discussed withholding some of this aid that’s actually required by law that it be withheld if they can’t certify that corruption has been eliminated or is being addressed?
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	And so we agree that we should withhold funds if there’s questions about corruption that have not been addressed.
2019-11-13	Chris Stewart	R-Stewart	Republican	I’m going to yield my rest of my time to Mr. Jordan.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank the gentleman. As we learned last night, story time last night, we get story time first thing this morning. Ambassador Sondland, welcome. Glad you’re here. I’m really not glad you’re here, but welcome to the fifth day of this circus.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	As I’ve noted before, the Democrats on this committee spent three years accusing President Trump of being a Russian agent. In March 2018, after a year-long investigation, Intelligence Committee Republicans issued a 240-page report describing in detail how the Russians meddled in the 2016 elections, and making specific recommendations to improve our election security. Denouncing the report as a whitewash, and accusing Republicans of subverting the investigation, the Democrats issued their own report, focusing on their now debunked conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to hack the elections.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Notably, the Democrats vowed at the time to present a further “comprehensive report,” after they finished their investigation into Trump’s treasonous collusion with Russia. For some completely unexplainable reason, after the implosion of their Russia hoax, the Democrats failed to issue that comprehensive report. We’re still waiting.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	This episode shows how the Democrats have exploited the Intelligence Committee for political purposes for three years. Culminating in these impeachment hearings, and their mania to attack the President. No conspiracy theory is too outlandish for the Democrats. Time and time again, they floated the possibility of some farfetched malfeasance by Trump, declared the dire need to investigate it, and then suddenly dropped the issue and moved on to their next asinine theory.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	A sampling of their accusations and insinuations includes these. Trump is a long time Russian agent as described in the Steele dossier. The Russians gave Trump advanced access to emails stolen by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Trump campaign based some of his activities on these stolen documents. Trump received nefarious materials from the Russians through a Trump campaign aid. Trump laundered Russian money through real estate deals. Trump was blackmailed by Russia through his financial exposure with Deutsche Bank. Trump had a diabolical plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Trump changed the Republican National Committee platform to hurt Ukraine, and benefit Russia. The Russians laundered money through the NRA for the Trump campaign. Trump’s son-in-law lied about his Russian contacts while obtaining his security clearance.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	It’s a long list of charges, all false, and I could go on, and on, and on but I’ll spare you for these moments. Clearly, these ludicrous accusations don’t reflect committee members who are honestly searching for the truth. They’re the actions of partisan extremists who hijacked the Intelligence Committee, transformed it into the Impeachment Committee, abandoned its core oversight functions, and turned it into a beachhead for ousting and elected president from office. You have to keep that history in mind as you consider the Democrats’ latest catalog of supposed Trump outrages.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Granted, a friendly call with the Ukrainian President wouldn’t seem to rise to the same level as being a Russian agent, but the Democrats were running out of time. If they waited any longer, their impeachment circus would intervene with their own candidates’ 2020 campaigns. You have to give them points for creativity, and selling this absurdity as an impeachable offense. All this explains why the Democrats have gathered zero Republican support in the House of Representatives for their impeachment crusade. In fact, the vote we held was a bipartisan vote against this impeachment inquiry.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, and Chairman Nadler are the key figures behind this impeachment crusade. All proclaim that impeachment is so damaging to the country that it can only proceed with bipartisan support. Are those declarations suddenly no longer true? Did impeachment become less divisive? Of course not. They know exactly what kind of damage they’re inflicting on this nation, that they’ve passed the point of no return.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	After three years of preparation work, much of it’s spearheaded by the Democrats on this committee, using all the tools of Congress to accuse, investigate, indict and smear the President. They stoked a frenzy amongst their most fanatical supporters that they can no longer control. Ambassador Sondland, you are here today to be smeared. You’ll make it through it, and I appreciate your service to this country, and I’m sorry that you’ve had to go through this.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In closing, the Democrats have zeroed in on an anonymous whistleblower complaint that was cooked up in cooperation with the Democrats on this very committee. They lied to the American people about that cooperation, and refused to let us question the whistleblower to discover the truth. Meanwhile, the Democrats lash out against anyone who questions or casts doubt on this spectacle.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	When Ukrainian President Zelensky denies anything improper happened on the phone call, the Democrats say that he’s a liar. When journalists report on the Ukraine election meddling and Hunter Biden’s position on the board of corrupt Ukrainian companies, the Democrats label them conspiracy theorists. When the Democrats can’t get any traction for their allegations of quid pro quo, they move the goalpost and accuse the President of extortion. Then, bribery, and at last resort obstruction of justice.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The American people sent us to Washington to solve problems. Not to wage scorched earth political warfare against the other party. This impeachment is not helping the American people. It’s not a legitimate use of taxpayer dollars. It’s definitely not improving our national security.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Finally, the Democrats’ fake outrage that President Trump used his own channel to communicate with Ukraine. I’ll remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that our first president, George Washington, directed his own diplomatic channels to secure a treaty with great Britain. If my Democratic colleagues were around in 1794, they’d probably want to impeach him too.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mr. Chairman, this morning. We have transmitted to you a letter exercising our rights under H.Res.660 to subpoena documents and witnesses. We take this step because you have failed to ensure fairness and objectivity in this inquiry. As such, we need to subpoena Hunter Biden, and the whistleblower for closed-door depositions, as well as relevant documents from the DNC, Hunter Biden’s firm, Rosemont Seneca, and the whistle blower.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In the interest of some basic level of fairness, we expect you to concur with these subpoenas. I’ll submit that letter for the record, and yield back the balance of my time.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	This is your, this is what you said about your conversation with the president, so this is your words about what the president told you.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That’s correct. “They are all corrupt. They’re all terrible people. And you know, I don’t want to spend any time with that.” And he also said, “They tried to take me down.”
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	When they tried to take him down, I think any logical person that wants to do two plus two equals four games would say, that was in the 2016 election, wasn’t it?
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So, during all this time, and remember in the spring, the Democrats’ Russia hoax witch hunt is still ongoing. They’re still claiming that President Trump is a Russian agent. They’re out to get President Trump at the time. His personal attorney is then interested in trying to figure out, “Okay, who are these Ukrainians that are trying to get to my candidate?” As those of us, the Republicans on this committee, who are also trying to get to the bottom of who were the sources in the Steele dossier that the Democrats had paid for? The House Republicans wanted to know that all through the spring and even the summer of, and even as of today, we’d still like to know.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That’s why we’ve subpoenaed the DNC operatives that they refuse to subpoena. We sent a letter this morning. I doubt we’ll see those subpoenas. We want to know exactly, get to the bottom of exactly who are these democratic operatives that were dirtying up the Trump campaign in 2016. And they just can’t get over that the president would send his personal attorney over there to try and get to the bottom of that. And Ambassador, you had very few dealings with Rudy Giuliani, a few text messages …
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So, the whistleblower, trying to put together here with their timeline, they seem to have a timeline problem, because the whistleblower that only they know, who they won’t subpoena, who clearly Mr. Vindman knows who they block testimony yesterday from and would not allow Mr. Vindman to answer our questions. That whistleblower says on July 25th that there were all these promises being made. Yet the … I forgot what they call it, the drug deal that the three amigos were cooking up seems to be their latest, you’re part of the three amigos and the drug deal, Ambassador. Were you aware of any drug deal on July 25th when the phone call actually occurred?
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Right, and did you know you’re a part of the three Amigos?
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And that’s the same thing Ambassador Volker said yesterday. Because, by the time the phone call that supposedly the whistleblower claims was the reason, was the original quid pro quo has now got down to, we’re now a month later where you’re involved and their quid pro quo has gotten down to down to the low level of, “Well, they want a statement.” And you didn’t even know about anything to do with, on July 25th you knew nothing about military aid being withheld.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	But on July, but you don’t know about, you are not on the July 25th call.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Where the aid doesn’t come up at all.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	We’ve had, everybody’s testified that was on the July 25th call, that there was no aid discussed on the July 25th call. So then, you’re in the process, you have no idea that this is tied to Burisma or anybody else. You say you don’t realize that until end of August.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I’m glad you bring up Burisma, because this is another issue that the Democrats don’t want to go into. They refuse to call in Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden could to get to the bottom of all of this. He could come in and talk about whether or not it was appropriate for him to receive over $50,000 a month while his dad was vice president, and when they actually were able to stop and get an investigator fired. They could call in Hunter Biden, but they don’t want to do it. But, let’s talk about Burisma, Ambassador. I know you’re the Ambassador to the EU. I think some of the members later we’ll get into whether or not it was appropriate for you to be in Ukraine or not. I believe it was. I think you have a clear mandate mandate to do it. But you wouldn’t be the first Ambassador to actually be interested in Burisma. Did you know that in September, 2015 then Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt publicly called for an investigation into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma? This was the Ukrainian Ambassador appointed by president Obama in Ukraine.
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You were not aware of it. So, you would not be the first one to be mentioning that investigation should be done on Burisma, because it happened during the Obama administration. Did you know that financial records show Burisma routed more than $3 million to the American accounts tied to Hunter Biden?
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Burisma’s American lawyers tried to secure a meeting with a new state prosecutor the same day his predecessor, Victor Shokin, who the vice president wanted fired, was announced?
2019-11-20	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Well, we’re not going to get to the answer to many of these questions because the witnesses that need to come in and clarify exactly what the Democrats were doing in 2016, we’re not going to be able to visit with those witnesses. And so, it’s an inconvenient truth that the Democrats don’t want to admit. It was their operatives that were dirtying up the Trump campaign using Ukrainian sources in 2016, and they do not want us to get to the bottom of it. They don’t want you, Ambassador, to get to the bottom of it. They don’t want the president’s personal attorney, even though he’s under a special council investigation that they fed into the FBI, that we’ve dealt with for over three years, they don’t want to get you to the bottom of that, Ambassador. I think Mr. Castor has some questions for you.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you. Throughout these bizarre hearings, the Democrats have struggled to make the case that President Trump committed some impeachable offense on his phone call with Ukrainian president Zelensky. The offense itself changes depending on the day ranging from quid pro quo to extortion, to bribery, to obstruction of justice, then back to quid pro quo. It?s clear why the Democrats have been forced onto this carousel of accusations. President Trump had good reason to be wary of Ukrainian election meddling against his campaign and of widespread corruption in that country. President Zelensky, who didn?t even know aid to Ukraine had been paused at the time of the call, has repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with the conversation. The aid was resumed without the Ukrainians taking the actions they were supposedly being coerced into doing.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Aid to Ukraine under President Trump has been much more robust than it was under President Obama. Thanks to the provision of Javelin anti-tank weapons. As numerous witnesses have testified, temporary holds on foreign aid occur fairly frequently for many different reasons. So how do we have an impeachable offense here when there?s no actual misdeed and no one even claiming to be a victim? The Democrats have tried to solve this dilemma with a simple slogan, ?he got caught.? President Trump, we are to believe, was just about to do something wrong and getting caught was the only reason he backed down from whatever nefarious thought crime the Democrats are accusing him of almost committing.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I once again urge Americans to continue to consider the credibility of the Democrats on this Committee, who are now hurling these charges for the last three years. It?s not president Trump who got caught, it?s the Democrats who got caught. They got caught falsely claiming they had more than circumstantial evidence that Trump colluded with Russians to hack the 2016 election. They got caught orchestrating this entire farce with the whistleblower and lying about their secret meetings with him. They got caught defending the false allegations of the Steele dossier, which was paid for by them. They got caught breaking their promise that impeachment would only go forward with bipartisan support because of how damaging it is to the American people.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	They got caught running a sham impeachment process between secret depositions, hidden transcripts, and an unending flood of Democrat leaks to the media. They got caught trying to obtain nude photos of President Trump from Russian pranksters pretending to be Ukrainians, and they got caught covering up for Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee operative, who colluded with Ukrainian officials to smear the Trump campaign by improperly redacting her name from deposition transcripts, and refusing to let Americans hear her testimony as a witness in these proceedings. That is the Democrats pitiful legacy in recent years. They got caught.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Meanwhile, their supposed star witness testified that he was guessing that President Trump was tying Ukrainian aid to investigations despite no one telling him that was true, and the president himself explicitly telling him the opposite, that he wanted nothing from Ukraine. Ladies and gentlemen, unless the Democrats once again scramble their kangaroo court rules, today?s hearing marks the merciful end of this spectacle in the Impeachment Committee, formerly known as the Intelligence Committee. Whether the Democrats reap the political benefit they want from this impeachment remains to be seen, but the damage they have done to this country will be long lasting. Will this wrenching attempt to overthrow the president? They have pitted Americans against one another and poison the mind of fanatics who actually believe the entire galaxy of bizarre accusations. They have level against the president since the day the American people elected him.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I sincerely hope the Democrats in this affair as quickly as possible so our nation can begin to heal the many wounds it has inflicted on us. The people?s faith in government and their belief that their vote counts for something has been shaken. From the Russia hoax to this shotty Ukrainian sequel, the Democrats got caught. Let?s hope they finally learn a lesson, give their conspiracy theories a rest, and focus on governing for a change. In addition, Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Rule XI, clause 2(j)(1), the Republican members transmit a request to convene a minority day of hearings. Today you have blocked key witnesses that we have requested from testifying in this partisan impeachment inquiry. This rule was not displaced by H.Res.660, and therefore under House Rule 11 clause 1(a), it applies to the Democrats impeachment inquiry. We look forward to the chair promptly scheduling an agreed upon time for the minority day of hearings so that we can hear from key witnesses that you have continually blocked from testifying.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I?d also like to take a quick moment on an assertion Ms. Hill made in the statement that she submitted to this Committee, in which she claimed that some Committee members deny that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. As I noted in my opening statement on Wednesday, but in March, 2018, Intelligence Committee Republicans published the results of a year long investigation into Russian meddling. The 240 page report analyzed 2016 Russian meddling campaign, the US government reaction to it, Russian campaigns in other countries and provided specific recommendations to improve American election security. I would asked my staff to hand these reports to our two witnesses today just so I can have a recollection of their memory. As America may or may not know, Democrats refused to sign on to the Republican report. Instead, they decided to adopt minority views, filled with collusion conspiracy theories. Needless to say, it is entirely possible for two separate nations to engage in election meddling at the same time, and Republicans believe we should take meddling seriously by all foreign countries regardless of which campaign is the target. I?d like to submit for the record, a copy of our report titled Report on Russian Active Measures. I yield back.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you, gentlemen. I want to get a few basic facts on the table of individuals that were involved in the 2016 election, just to see who you know and who you?ve met with. I?ll start with you. Mr. Holmes, have you met with or do you know Alexandra Chalupa?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Do you know Nellie Ohr? Have you met with Nellie Ohr?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Bruce Ohr?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Glenn Simpson?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you. Same question for you, Dr. Hill, do you know or have you met with Alexandra Chalupa?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Nellie Ohr?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Bruce Ohr?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Years ago.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Glenn Simpson?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Dr. Hill, in your testimony, you said that ? in your deposition, excuse me, that Christopher Steele was your counterpart at one time, is this correct?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You testified that you met with Christopher Steele in 2016. I assume that?s still correct?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And the only thing we didn?t get on that is do you know about when that was in 2016 and how many times?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I?m asking about in 2016.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	But you don?t remember the date?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. You stated in your deposition that a colleague had showed you the Steele Dossier before it was published. Who was that colleague?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And who was that?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And he shared it with you.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you. You mentioned in your deposition also that you thought that it was a, let?s get the exact quote, that ?the dossier was a rabbit hole.? Is that still your testimony?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Do you know who paid Christopher Steele to do, to generate the Steele Dossiers? There were several of them.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Do you know who was, and there was a law firm involved, but you know who the source of the money was?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	But do you know who-
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And the Clinton campaign.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Mr. Castor.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mr. Holmes, I want to go back to name some Americans. Now I want to talk a little bit about Ukrainians, Ukrainian government officials.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Are you familiar with Serhiy Leshchenko?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Have you met with him?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	He was a journalist then he was in the parliament. Is he currently in the parliament?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Journalist again. Are you aware that when he was in the parliament that he had provided information to a Fusion GPS operative named Nellie Ohr?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Well, he was in the parliament at the time. This is in the 2016 campaign. He provided a widely known as the ?black ledger.? Have you ever heard of the ?black ledger?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And the ?black ledger,? is that seen as credible information?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The ?black ledger? is credible?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Bob Mueller did not find it credible. Do you dispute what Bob Mueller?s findings were? They didn?t use it in the prosecution or in the report.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So the motivation for Leshchenko as it was reported was to go after a Trump campaign official and undermine Trump?s candidacy. Are you aware of that?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Right, but he?s admitted motivation was to partly at least undermine the Trump candidacy that he did not support.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you?re aware that the ? you heard Dr. Hill?s testimony, but the Steele Dossier that contained initially that initial information that was fed in the F.B.I., were you aware that the Democrats had paid for that information?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I?m not accusing of involvement, I?m just asking if you, not even if you knew at the time, but you now know today that the Democrats had paid for that information.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Not accusing any involvement of you with the Steele Dossier.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	But you?re not disputing that the Democrat and the Clinton campaign were the source of funds that funded the Steele Dossier.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Do you think it?s appropriate for political parties to run operatives in foreign countries to dig up dirt on their opponents?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Dr. Hill, do you think it?s appropriate for political parties to pay operatives to dig up dirt on their opponents?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you. Mr. Castor.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Since we?re on the topic of Ukraine energy, I think it?s a good way for us to segue into Burisma, which I assume both of you are familiar with. You?ve heard about it for many, many years. You?re on the ground there now, Mr. Holmes, I know you weren?t there, but at the time, that in September, 2015 then Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, Obama appointed career ambassador, I?m sure you know him.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Credible?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Successful ambassador, I?m sure. He called for an investigation into Zlochevsky the owner of Burisma, president of Burisma. Are you familiar that?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Did you know about Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kent?s concerns about the potential conflict of interest with Hunter Biden sitting on the board of Burisma?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that the financial records show that this Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma routed more than three million dollars to the American accounts of Hunter Biden?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Were you familiar with that, Dr. Hill?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Did you know that Burisma?s American ? and this is back to you, Mr. Holmes. Did you know that Burisma?s American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after the Vice President forced the firing of the country?s chief prosecutor?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Burisma?s American lawyers tried to secure a meeting with the new state prosecutor the same day the predecessor Viktor Shokin?s firing was announced?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Joe Biden called the Ukrainian President Poroshenko at least three times in February, 2016, shortly after the president and owner of Burisma?s home was raided on February 2nd by the state prosecutor?s office?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Devon Archer and Hunter Biden reached out to the Deputy Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, shortly after the raid on Burisma?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Dr. Hill, did you know about. I don?t want to go through and ask all those questions over again.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You did not know about any of those.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. So you obviously know that the President had concerns about Burisma. Had concerns about 2016 election meddling by the Ukrainians. When you were in there as the head of the Ukraine desk, did you ever raise any of these ? did you ever brief the President or raise it up to Ambassador Bolton about any concerns through 2017 and 18 that concerned 2016 election meddling or Burisma concerns?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So as far as you know, you did no briefings, no papers, answered no questions as it relates to the 2016 election or Burisma during your time there?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Okay, Mr. Castor.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Dr. Hill? If you mind, transfer. Sorry. Dr. Hill, I just want to drill down on this a little bit. The president of the United States, Commander and Chief, was concerned about the 2016 elections in Burisma. He had his personal attorney working these issues because he was under investigation by Robert Mueller, special counsel, partly beginning with an investigation that started with the Steele dossier that we?ve already established that the Democrats had paid for and had then fed into the FBI. So the end of the day, the Commander and Chief concerned about 2016 election meddling by Ukraine, it sounds like you had just earlier testified that you weren?t aware of that, but if that was the concern of the president to try to get to the bottom of it and it?s the concern of Ambassador Sondland who was trying to set up meetings on behalf of? To ensure really that meetings occurred and phone calls occurred to strengthen the relationship? I?m a little? I mean, I understand the people at the NSC, people at State Department had issues with that, but at the end of the day, isn?t it the Commander and Chief that makes those decisions?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I assume we?re getting eight minutes there.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Right. I just want to echo that sentiment and certainly lament the attacks that have been levied against our colleague, Elise Stefanik, on this panel, which have been vile and hateful. For those of you keeping score at home, the effort to accuse our president of coercion, extortion, or bribery with these witnesses, as we now come to the closing session of this, basically break down as follows. We have Kent and Ambassador Taylor who spoke of hearsay. Their hearsay of these matters that they said that they had heard were all statements that they?d heard from others who have also testified in front of us, so there?s no one that?s missing. There?s no one out there. Kent and Taylor basically said that they?d heard it from Morrison and Sondland. Morrison had indicated he?d heard it from Sondland. Sondland testified yesterday. He?d heard it from no one on the planet.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Vindman and Morrison both have direct testimony of the phone call with the president of the United States. Beyond that, they only had contact with Sondland. And again, Sondland indicated he had contact with no one on the planet. Volker testified that he did have direct contact both with the Ukrainians and with the president of the United States and indicated that the president of the United States did not condition either a phone call, a meeting, or aid upon Ukraine undertaking investigations and also testified that the Ukrainians did not believe that either.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	We also have the direct statements from the president of Ukraine and the foreign minister, that they did not feel any pressure to undertake investigations. We also have the evidence, that we?re all very much aware of, which is they did not undertake any investigations. We also have Yovanovitch and Dr. Hill. Yovanovitch obviously left before the time period. Dr. Hill, we appreciate your being with us today, and Mr. Holmes. Dr. Hill, you have provided me probably the greatest piece of evidence that?s before us to illustrate the problem with hearsay. You said, ?Based on questions and statements, I have heard some of you on this committee ? that?d be us ? appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country.? And perhaps somehow for some reason, it was Ukraine.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	This ? It was held up by Devin Nunes ? is the report on Russian active measures that was voted on by all of us. It begins with this sentence. In 2015, Russia began engaging in a covert influence campaign aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Every one of us. Little small, you know, effort on your part, Dr. Hill, and you would have known that what you just said was not true, what you had heard. But you felt the need to put it in your eight-page statement before you went on to tell us a bunch of other things that you heard about other people, no matter how convinced you were of, also which were not necessarily true. One of which was that you said that Ambassador Sondland met with Giuliani.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Actually, Ambassador Sondland testified here that he had not, as ambassador, met with Giuliani. He?d briefly met him in his lifetime by shaking his hand, and Giuliani issued a statement that they had never met either. This is the problem with no matter how convinced we are, Dr. Hill, no matter how much we believe we know that what we?ve heard is true, it is still just what we?ve heard. But so far in this hearing, in these series of hearings, the only thing that we have is Volker saying, ?I spoke to the president and I?ve spoke to the Ukrainians, neither of which believed that aid was conditioned, neither of which believed that the president was requiring it,? and Ambassador Sondland, which said no one on the planet told him that that was the case. That?s the sole evidence.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Now ,I got to tell you, the one that gets interesting is Ambassador Sondland did say it?s his belief that a meeting with the president was conditioned upon investigations. Ambassador Volker, who I think is a man of very civic integrity, said that that was not the case. Now, even if Ambassador Sondland is correct that somebody ? And Dr. Hill, you testified. And again, it?s hearsay. You don?t know ? that supposedly Mulvaney told him that, because he didn?t testify to that. But let?s say somebody beside the president told him that. You guys want to be the laughing stock of history to impeach a president of United States because he didn?t take a meeting? Oh, please, dear God. Please undertake that.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Now, Mr. Holmes. I got to tell you. You say that you?re ?
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mr. Holmes, in your testimony, you said that Sondland said, ?He loves your ass,? and also said, ?He?ll do anything that you want.? Mr. Holmes, that information had nothing whatsoever to do with the subject matter of any of these hearings. It was anecdotal. It was extraneous. Your statements that your interests are protecting Ukraine are very dubious when you embarrass President Zelensky by making those statements you didn?t have to make. Who cares that Ambassador Sondland said that? And you know you didn?t embarrass Ambassador Sondland. You embarrassed Zelensky, because you know he got asked this question in his own country and people are hearing that statement as if it?s true.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	It?s totally dubious if you do that for [crosstalk 01:24:43].
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I yield back.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I want to use my time to speak directly to my colleagues and to the American people. Today?s witnesses and the ones we?ve been privileged to have before the committee over the last two weeks, have provided an invaluable service to our country. Not just in all your careers, but in having the courage and the patriotism to share your facts with the American people. And you do so at considerable risk to yourselves, but you?ve clearly stepped forward for the simple fact you believe it?s your duty.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And all your testimony reaffirms a very central fact, President Trump conditioned our foreign policy and national security on getting a valuable political benefit from Ukraine. He wanted Ukraine?s new president to create ethical questions about Joe Biden by publicly announcing investigations. And to pressure President Zelensky to take that action that would benefit his personal political interest, he withheld vital military aid to Ukraine and refused to meet with President Zelensky in the Oval Office. And as we heard from Mr. Holmes and Dr. Hill today, that meeting was extraordinarily important to Ukraine, and extraordinarily important in sending a message to Russia about our unyielding support.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The witnesses have made it absolutely clear what the president did. And it?s equally clear that President Trump has launched a coverup and disinformation campaign to hide this abuse of power from the American people. That?s why the administration refuses to provide documents to this committee. It?s why the White House has taken the unprecedented position that senior officials could ignore congressional subpoenas and refuse to testify. That?s why acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, Secretary of State Pompeo, and others have not testified.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Now the president, and even some members of this committee, are pretending this is normal. It is not. It must never be. No other president has betrayed his office like this by putting his own small political interest above our national interest and our national security.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I asked some of our witnesses what would happen in any American city or town if the mayor stopped funding the police department until the chief of police launched an investigation into the mayor?s political rival, or a governor, or a member of Congress did that, and the answer was clear.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	It would be wrong. It would be illegal and it wouldn?t be tolerated. It would violate the most basic trust we have in public officials. If it happened with a military commander, a court martial would follow. If it happened with a corporation, the CEO would be fired. We all know this kind of conduct is wrong, but the president continues to say it isn?t. He says it?s ?perfect? and he?d do it again tomorrow.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The same rules apply to mayors, governors, members of Congress, CEOs, and everyone else in America. They apply to the president, too. Whether you?re a Republican or Democrat, you like MSNBC or FOX, I think every American believes in one of our nation?s founding principles. No person is above the law, not even the president.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	July 24th Director Mueller testified about Russian state sponsored systematic interference in our 2016 election. He expressed apprehension this could become the new normal. The day after, on July 25th, President Trump spoke to President Zelensky and asked a favor. That favor was that Ukraine interfere in our 2020 election.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	If we allow this to stand, to become the new normal, it will be the standard for all future presidents. In good conscience, none of us can do that. This conduct corrupts our democracy. It corrupts how our country conducts foreign policy. It threatens our national security and the security of all Americans. And it is, in my view, a clear betrayal of the president?s oath of office. I yield back.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you. I have stressed in these hearings that the whistleblower complaint was merely a pretext for Donald Trump?s political opponents to do what they?ve been trying to do since he was elected: oust the president from office. A brief timeline will illustrate the wide range of extraordinary attacks his administration has faced. I?m going to start in June of 2016, when Donald Trump was just a candidate. On behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS hires Christopher Steele to write the Steele dossiers, a collection of false allegations attributed to Russian sources claiming that Donald Trump is a Russian agent.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Fast-forward to January 6th of 2017. FBI Director James Comey briefs President-Elect Trump on the Steele dossier. The briefing is leaked to CNN, and soon afterwards, BuzzFeed publishes the dossiers. January 20th, on President Trump?s inauguration day, The Washington Post runs a story headlined, ?The Campaign to Impeach Donald Trump Has Begun.? January 30th, 10 days later: The whistleblower?s current lawyer tweets, ?#coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachment will follow immediately.? March 22nd, Democrats on this committee falsely declare on national TV that they have more than circumstantial evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. July 12th, an article of impeachment is filed against President Trump in the House of Representatives. November 15th, Democrats file additional articles of impeachment against President Trump.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	As you see, this was just in President Trump?s first year in office. He was subjected to a coordinated smear operation designed to falsely portray him as a Russian agent, as well as attempts to impeach him. This all occurred before his now-infamous call with President Zelensky. In 2018, the attacks continued, often from Executive Branch officials charged with implementing his policies. On February 2nd, 2018, Intelligence Committee Republicans release a memo revealing that the FBI used fabrications of the Steele dossier to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate. September 5th, The New York Times prints a column by an anonymous Trump administration official, who explains that he and other senior officials are ?working diligently from within to frustrate parts of Trump?s agenda.? December 7th, James Comey admits to Congress the Steele dossier was unverified before and after the FBI used it to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The Russia hoax continued to be the main focus of attacks going into 2019, but when that entire operation collapsed, a new impeachment pretext had to be found. May 4th, 2019, on national television, a Democratic congressman proclaims, ?I?m concerned that if we don?t impeach this president, he will get reelected.? July 24th of this year, Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifies to Congress about his report, which debunked the conspiracy theory that Trump campaign associates conspired with Russia to hack the 2016 election.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	July 25th, just the very next day, a new anti- Trump operation begins as someone listens to the president?s phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky and leaks the contents to the so-called whistleblower. September 13th, Democrats on this committee take the extraordinary step of issuing a press release related to the whistleblower?s complaint. October 2nd, it?s revealed that Democratic staff on this committee had contact with the whistleblower before he submitted his complaint to the Inspector General, contradicting Democrat denials that such contact had occurred. October 31st, Halloween, probably the most appropriate day, Democrats in the House of Representatives vote to open an official impeachment inquiry against President Trump.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	What you?ve seen in this room over the past two weeks is a show trial, a planned result of three years of political operations and dirty tricks, campaigns waged against this president. And like any good show trial, the verdict was decided before the trial ever began. After all, after denouncing the president for years as a Russian agent and a threat to democracy, how could the Democrats not impeach him? If they don?t move to overthrow him, it would indicate that they don?t really believe their own dire warnings about the threat he poses.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	"The Democrats only needed a pretext. When their Russian dossiers and investigations failed to do the job, they moved to plan B, the Ukraine hoax. This spectacle, with its secret depositions and mid-hearing press conferences, is not meant to discover the facts; it was designed to produce a specific storyline to be pushed forward by the Democrats and their supporters in the media."
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ladies and gentlemen, as we approach Thanksgiving, Speaker Pelosi has just made clear, just today, USMCA, the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico, will boost our economy, won?t be signed this year. So I hope Mr. Schiff will clarify how much longer we will waste on this effort, and what other vital legislation he?s willing to sacrifice for this impeachment crusade. Will there be even more secret depositions accompanied by the usual flood of Democratic leaks? Will we have more public hearings with Democrat witnesses, but not ours? Minority are in the dark about what this committee will be doing when we return, and so is America.
2019-11-21	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	James Madison warned us about the danger posed by the tyranny of the majority. To avoid that threat, our founders created a constitutional republic. But is there a better example of the tyranny of majority than the way this impeachment process has been run in the House of Representatives? A process that is grossly unfair can only stem from a cynical majority that is willing to break long-established precedents, trample on legitimate minority concerns, and impose their absolute will on this body through sheer force of numbers. Exploiting the Intelligence Committee as a venue for impeachment has been one of the grossest abuses in a process filled with cynical manipulations large and small. But this farce will soon move to the Judiciary Committee, where impeachment rightfully belongs. I wish my Republican colleagues well in fighting this travesty and defending the idea, which at one time received bipartisan support not long ago, that the American people?s vote actually means something. Yield back.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I thank the gentleman. It’s unfortunate that today and for most of next week we will continue engaging in the Democrats daylong TV spectacles instead of solving the problems we were all sent to Washington to address. We now have a major trade agreement with Canada and Mexico ready for approval, a deal that would create jobs and boost our economy. Meanwhile, we have not yet approved funding for the government which expires next week along with funding for our men and women in uniform. Instead the Democrats have convened us once again to advance their operation to topple a duly elected president. I will note that five, five, Democrats on this committee had already voted to impeach this President before the Trump-Zelensky phone call occurred.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In fact, Democrats have been vowing to oust President Trump since the day he was elected. So Americans can rightly suspect that his phone call with President Zelensky was used as an excuse for the Democrats to fulfill their Watergate fantasies. But I’m glad that on Wednesday after the Democrats staged six weeks of secret depositions in the basement of the capital like some kind of strange cult, the American people finally got to see this farce for themselves. They saw us sit through hours of hearsay testimony about conversations that two diplomats who had never spoken to the president heard second hand, third hand and forth hand from other people. In other words rumors. The problem of trying to overthrow a president based on this type of evidence is obvious, but that’s what their whole case relies on beginning with second hand and third hand information cited by the whistleblower.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That’s why on Wednesday the Democrats were forced to make the absurd argument that hearsay can be much better evidence than direct evidence. And just when you thought the spectacle couldn’t get more bizarre, committee Republicans received a memo from the Democrats threatening ethics referrals if we out the whistleblower. As the Democrats are well aware, no Republicans here know the whistleblower’s identity because the whistleblower only met with Democrats, not with Republicans. The chairmanship claimed not to know who it is yet he also vowed to block us from asking questions that could reveal his or her identity. Republicans on this committee are left wondering how it is even possible for the chairman to block questions about a person whose identity he claims not to know.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The American people may be seeing these absurdities for the first time but Republicans on this dais are used to them. Until they secretly met with a whistleblower, Democrats showed little interest for the last three years in any topic aside from the ridiculous conspiracy theories that President Trump is a Russian agent. When you find yourself on the phone like the Democrats did with the Russian pranksters offering you nude pictures of Trump and afterward you order your staff to follow up and get the photos as the Democrats also did, then it might be time to ask yourself if you have gone out too far on a limb. Even as they were accusing Republicans of colluding with Russians, the Democrats themselves were colluding with the Russians by funding the Steele dossier which was based on Russian and Ukrainian sources.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Meanwhile, they turn a blind eye to Ukrainians meddling in our elections because the Democrats were cooperating with that operation. This was the subject of a July 20th, 2017 letter, sent by Senator Grassley to then Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. The letter raised concerns about the activities of Alexandra Chalupa, a contractor for the Democratic National Committee who worked with Ukrainian Embassy officials to spread dirt on the Trump campaign.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	As Senator Grassley wrote, Chalupa’s action… “Chalupa’s actions appear to show that she was simultaneously working on behalf of a foreign government, Ukraine, and on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton campaign in an effort to influence not only the US voting population, but US government officials”. After touting the Steele dossier and defending the FBI’s Russia investigation which are now being investigated by Inspector General Horowitz and Attorney General Barr, Democrats on this committee ignore Ukrainian election meddling even though Chalupa publicly admitted to the Democrats scheme.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Likewise, they are blind to the blaring signs of corruption surrounding Hunter Biden’s well-paid position on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company while his father served as vice president and point man for Ukraine issues in the Obama administration. But the Democrats media hacks only cared about that issue briefly when they were trying to stop Joe Biden from running against Hillary Clinton in 2015. As I previously stated, these hearings should not be occurring at all until we get the answers to three crucial questions the Democrats refused to ask.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	First, what is the full extent of the Democrats prior coordination with the whistleblower and who else did the whistleblower coordinate this effort with? Second, what is the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump campaign? And third, why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden, what did he do for them and did his position affect any government actions under the Obama administration? I will note that house Democrats vowed they would not put the American people through a wrenching impeachment process without bipartisan support and they have none. Add that to their ever-growing list of broken promises and destructive deceptions.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In closing, Mr. Chair, the president of the United States released his transcript right before the hearing began. I think it is important that I read this into the record so that there is no confusion over this first phone call that occurred on April 21st, with president-elect, Zelensky, and I would like to read it. The president, I would like to congratulate you on a job well done and congratulations on a fantastic election. Zelensky, good to hear from you. Thank you so very much. It is nice to hear from you and I appreciate the congratulations. The president, that was an incredible election. Zelensky, again, thank you so very much. As you can see, we tried very hard to do our best. We had you as a great example. The president, I think you will do a great job.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I have many friends in Ukraine who know you and like you. I have many friends from Ukraine and frankly, expected you to win and it’s really an amazing thing that you have done. I guess in a way I did something similar. We are making tremendous progress in the US. We have the most tremendous economy ever. I just wanted to congratulate you. I have no doubt you will be a fantastic president. Zelensky, first of all, thank you so very much again, for the congratulations. We in the Ukraine are an independent country, an independent Ukraine. We are going to do everything for the people. You are, as I said, a great example. We are hoping we can expand on our jobs as you did. You will also be a great example for many. You are a great example for our new managers. I would also like to invite you if possible, to the inauguration. I know how busy you are but if it’s possible for you to come to the inauguration ceremony, that would be great.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Great for you to do to be with us on that day. The president, that’s very nice. I will look into that and give us a date. At the very minimum we will have a great representative or more from the United States will be with you on that great day. So we will have somebody at a minimum a very, very high level and will be with you. Really an incredible day for an incredible achievement. Zelensky, again, thank you. We are looking forward to your visit to the visit of a high-level delegation, but there is no words that can describe our wonderful country, how nice, warm and friendly our people are, how tasty and delicious our food is and how wonderful Ukraine is. Words cannot describe our country so it would be best for you to see it yourself. So if you can come, that would be great. So again, I invite you to come.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The president, well, I agree with you about your country and I look forward to it. When I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people. Ukraine always very well represented. It was always very well represented. When you are settled in and ready, I would like to invite you to the White House. We will have a lot of things to talk about but we are with you all of the way. Zelensky, thank you for the invitation. We accept the invitation and look forward to the visit. Thank you again. The whole team and I are looking forward to the visit. Thank you for the congratulations and I think it will still be great if you can come and be with us on this important day. The results are incredible. They are very impressive for us. So it will be absolutely fantastic if you could come on that day.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The president, very good. We will let you know very soon and we will see you very, very soon regardless. Congratulations and please say hello to the Ukrainian people and your family. Let them know I send my best regards. Well, thank you… Zelensky, well, thank you. You have a safe flight and see you soon. President, take care of yourself and give a great speech today. You take care of yourself and I will see you soon. Zelensky, thank you very much. It is difficult for me but I will practice English and I will meet in English. Thank you very much. The president laughing, all that’s beautiful to hear. That’s really good. I could not do it in your language. I’m very impressed. Thank you so much. Zelensky, thank you so much. The president, good day, good luck. I’m glad I was able to read that into the record so that now the American people know the very first call that President Trump had with President Zelensky. And with that, I yield back the balance of my time.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	First, Mr. Chair, I want to submit for the record Senator Grassley’s letter to the Department of Justice dated July 20th, 2017. I read a portion of that into the record during my opening statement.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ambassador, congratulate you. You’ve been down in the secret deposition meeting rooms. You’ve graduated for your performance today. Later this afternoon, I should note that for the public, that we will be back down in the basement of the Capitol, doing more of these secret depositions. Ambassador, I just have a… I don’t really have very many questions for you. You admitted in your opening statement that you don’t have any firsthand knowledge of the issues that we’re looking into. But I do want to talk a little bit about Senator Grassley very briefly. I assume that you know who Senator Grassley is.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Do you believe that Senator Grassley is a serious and credible elected official?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Were you involved in the July 25th Trump-Zelensky phone call or preparations for the call?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Were you involved in the deliberations about the pause in military sales to Ukraine as the Trump administration reviewed newly elected President Zelensky’s commitment to corruption reforms?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	For the pause.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Were you involved in the proposed Trump-Zelensky, later Pence-Zelensky, meetings in Warsaw, Poland on September 1st?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you ever talk to President Trump in 2019?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mick Mulvaney?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you, Ambassador. I’m not exactly sure what the ambassador is doing here today. This is the House Intelligence Committee that’s now turned into the House Impeachment Committee. This seems more appropriate for the Subcommittee on Human Resources at the Foreign Affairs Committee. If there’s issues with employment disagreements with the administration, it would seem like this would be a more appropriate setting instead of an impeachment hearing where the ambassador is not a material fact witness to anything, any of the accusations that are being hurled at the president for this impeachment inquiry.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I have several questions I think Mr. Castor wants to get to. I know Miss Stefanik, you had a few quick questions for the ambassador. Yield to you, Miss Stefanik.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I just recognized-
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You’re gagging the young lady from New York?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mr. Chair, we control the time. It’s been customary to this committee that whoever controls the time can yield to whoever they wish. If we have members of Congress that have a few questions, it seems appropriate that we be able to let Miss Stefanik ask her questions.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	All right. Mr. Castor, you’re recognized.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Just to remind the gentlemen, there’s actually three calls. There’s the two calls with President Trump and the one that you reiterated in our last hearing a couple of weeks ago. Ambassador, I just want to clarify something before I yield. Are you against political appointed ambassadors? Is it not the president’s prerogative to appoint whoever he wants in any country?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I just wanted to clear that up. Now, can I yield to Ms. Stefanik? Do I need your permission?
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I would just say to the American people, today’s show trial has come to an end.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	We’re headed down now to the basement of the Capitol to go until… I don’t know what time. And we’ll be back there hiding again behind the closed doors, interviewing more witnesses that you may or may not be able to see in the public. I hate to break it to my colleagues if there’s anyone else out there watching television ratings, but they must be plummeting right now.
0201-11-15	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And I would suggest that we get back to the work of the Intelligence Committee, that we pass a trade agreement with the United States, Mexico and Canada that would actually help the American people out. Because this is an embarrassment. I’ll yield back.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Welcome back to act two of today’s circus, ladies and gentlemen. We are here to continue what the Democrats tell us is a serious, somber, and even prayerful process of attempting to overthrow a duly elected president. If they’re successful, the end result would be to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans who thought the president is chosen by the American people, not by 13 Democrat partisans on a committee that’s supposed to be overseeing the government’s intelligence agencies.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Isn’t it strange how we’ve morphed into the impeachment committee, presiding over a matter that has no intelligent component whatsoever? Impeachment, of course, is the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee, not the intelligence committee, but putting this sparse in our court provides two main advantages for the Democrats. It made it easier for them to shroud their depositions in secrecy and it allowed them to avoid giving too big of a role in this spectacle to another Democrat committee chairman, and whom the Democrat leaders obviously have no confidence.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Who can possibly view these proceedings as fair and impartial? They are being conducted by Democrats who spent three years saturating the airwaves with dire warnings that President Trump is a Russian agent and these outlandish attacks continue to this very day. Just this weekend in front of a crowd of democratic party activists, the chairman of this committee denounced President Trump as a profound threat to our democracy and vowed that we will send that charlatan and the White House back to the golden throne he came from.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	How can anyone believe that people who would utter such dramatic absurdities are conducting a fair impeachment process and are only trying to discover the truth? It’s obvious the Democrats are trying to topple the president solely because they despise him because they’ve promised since election day to impeach him and because they’re afraid he will win re-election next year. No witnesses have identified any crime or impeachable offense committed by the president, but that doesn’t matter.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Last week, the Democrats told us his infraction was asking for a quid pro quo. This week, it’s bribery. Who knows what ridiculous crime they’ll be accusing him of next week? As witnesses, the Democrats have called a parade of government officials who don’t like President Trump’s Ukraine policy, even though they acknowledge he provided Ukraine with lethal military aid after the Obama administration refused to do so. They also resent his conduct of policy through channels outside their own authority and control. These actions they argue contradict the so-called interagency consensus.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	They don’t seem to understand that the president alone is constitutionally vested with the authority to set the policy. The American people elect a president, not an interagency consensus. And of course our previous witnesses had very little new information to share in these hearings, that’s because these hearings are not designed to uncover new information. They’re meant to showcase a handpicked group of witnesses who the Democrats determined through their secret audition process will provide testimony most conductive and conducive to their accusations.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In fact, by the time any witness says anything here, people are actually hearing it for the third time. They heard it first through the Democrats cherry- pick leaks to their media sympathizers during the secret depositions and second, when the Democrats publish those deposition transcripts in a highly staged manner. Of course, there are no transcripts from crucial witnesses like Hunter Biden who could testify about his well paying job and the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company, or Alexandra Chalupa who worked on an election meddling scheme with Ukrainian officials on behalf of the democratic national committee and the Clinton campaign. That’s because the Democrats refused to let us hear from them. As for evidence, what we’re left with is the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky phone call, which the president made public. That means Americans can read for themselves an unremarkable conversation with President Zelensky who repeatedly expressed satisfaction with the call afterward. The Democrats, however, claimed President Zelensky was being bribed and therefore, he must be lying when he says the call was friendly and pose no problems.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	There’s some irony here, for weeks we’ve heard the Democrats bemoan the damage President Trump supposedly caused to the US-Ukrainian relations, but when the Ukrainian president contradicts their accusations, they publicly dismiss him as a liar. I may be wrong, but I’m fairly sure calling a friendly foreign president, newly elected a liar violates their so-called interagency consensus.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So overall, the Democrats would have you believe President Zelensky was being blackmailed with a pause on lethal military aide that he didn’t even know about, that President Trump did not mention to him, and that diplomats have testified they always assumed would be lifted, which it was. Without the Ukrainians undertaking any of the actions, they were supposedly being coerced into doing. This process is not serious. It’s not sober and it is certainly not prayerful.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	It’s an ambitious attack to deprive the American people of the right to elect a president the Democrats don’t like. As I mentioned, chairman of this committee claims that democracy is under threat. If that’s true, it’s not the president who poses the danger. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Nunes. Thank you both for being here today and also for participating in the lengthy depositions. Ambassador Volker, you were the first one on October 3rd, and Mr. Morrison. You were with us on Halloween. So thank you for your participation. Mr. Morrison, I also want to thank you. You’re a long time hill staffer. I certainly have appreciation for that, nearly 20 years, so thank you. And Ambassador Volker, Hatboro, Pennsylvania resident. That’s an incredible part of the country.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I’m from nearby. I just want to walk through some of your positions. You were a Senate confirmed ambassador to NATO for a stint?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And then you were at the state department, and your portfolio span much of what I believe George Kent has currently.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And then you’re involved with the National Security Council. You were the director for NATO in Western Europe?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And then you were the senior director for European and Eurasian affairs.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Much like [crosstalk 01:33:28] Mr. Morrison had. And we’ll note that all the witnesses that we have interacted with have just heaped praise on you. Ambassador Yovanovitch said you are a brilliant diplomat, and so that’s very high praise. And for over two years, you served as the special representative for Ukraine negotiations.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you served for free.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You served on a voluntary basis.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you put a lot of time and effort into that job, didn’t you?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And the tax payers certainly got their money’s worth, didn’t they?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you believe America’s policy towards Ukraine has been strengthened during your tenure as the special representative?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Is it fair to say that’s in part due to President Trump?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And for for many years there had been an initiative in the inner agency to advocate for lethal defensive weaponry for Ukraine. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And it wasn’t until President Trump and his administration came in that that went through?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The delegation to President Zelensky’s inauguration in May, I believe you testified it was one of the largest delegations.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. And included in the delegation was Secretary Perry?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. And we’ve talked a little bit this morning, but President Zelensky’s inauguration came together rather quickly?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	There’s been some discussion about whether the vice president was going to be able to lead that effort. And as it turned out, he was not able to lead it. Do you have any information as to why the vice president was unable to join?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And Mr. Morrison, do you have any information as to why the vice president was unable to participate in the delegation?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ambassador Volker, you testified during your deposition that aid in fact does get held up from time to time for a whole assortment of reasons. Is that your understanding?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And sometimes the holdups are rooted in something at OMB. Sometimes it’s at the defense department. Sometimes it’s just at the state department. Sometimes it’s on the hill, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And so when the aid was held up for 55 days for Ukraine, that didn’t in and of itself strike you as uncommon?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. And in fact there were concerns that perhaps President Zelensky wasn’t going to be the reformer that he campaigned on?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And in fact the aid was lifted shortly after he was able to convene a parliament?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And when he was able to convene a parliament, he was able to push through a number of anticorruption initiatives?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And that was an encouraging sign?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And other than these things going on in the background with the pause in the aid, the US relations with Ukraine, you testified or you stated it was about as good as you’d want them to be?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You testified at your deposition that once the aid was lifted, despite all the things going on in the background, that US Ukrainian relations were strong, were as good as you’d want them to be?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you referenced that the security sector assistance was lifted, any hold on that, that there was a positive meeting in New York?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	At the UNGA. And there was momentum and putting pressure on the Russians. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In your deposition, you made it clear that President Trump had a deep rooted negative view on Ukraine and their corruption environment?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you first became aware of his views back in September, 2017?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Can you tell us a little bit about that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And so long before President Zelensky was elected, President Trump had a negative view of Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Back in 2017, do you remember anything he said or did that gave you a feeling that he had these negative views?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay, fair enough. And you described the president’s skepticism at your deposition as a reasonable position?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And I believe you said most people who know anything about Ukraine would possibly think that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you viewed it as part of your role to help change his mind that President Zelensky was a genuine reformer, that he was not running for office for self enrichment, that he was indeed a good person?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	During the May 23rd meeting with the president in the oval office, could you just relay to us the concerns the president articulated about Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And when the president said that the Ukrainians tried to take him down, did you have any idea what he was referring to?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And to the best of your knowledge, the president genuinely believed that. Right?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. And Mr. Morrison, you are also aware of the president’s skeptical view of foreign aid generally?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And that there was an initiative that he was looking at foreign aid pretty broadly?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And trying to scrutinize to make sure the US taxpayers were getting their money’s worth?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And the president was also interested, was he not, in better understanding opportunities for increased burden sharing among the Europeans?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And what can you tell us about that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And was there any inter-agency activity, whether it be with the state department or the defense department, coordination by the National Security Council to look into that a little bit for the president?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And so the president evinced concerns, the inter-agency tried to address them?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And by late August, we just discussed with Ambassador Volker that a new Rata was seated. And did that give possibly some hope that President Zelensky would be able to push through some of these reforms?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And did you hope during this time period, during this 55 days where the aid was paused, that potentially Zelensky would be able to demonstrate his bona fides and would subsequently be able to get the president to lift the aid?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In fact, you traveled with Ambassador Bolton to Ukraine right around labor day weekend, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you met with President Zelensky on, I believe it was August 29th?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And that’s right around the time when the Rata had met and they had started to push through their reforms?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And some of these reforms included naming a new prosecutor general?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And they pushed through some legislation that eliminated immunity for Rata members?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And I believe you provided some color into this experience, this meeting, and you said that the Ukrainians had been up all night working on some of these…
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ukrainians had been up all night, working on some of these legislative initiatives.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Was Ambassador Bolton encouraged by the activity?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And was the meeting altogether favorable?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	At that point in time, after the meeting, Ambassador Bolton did he head off to Warsaw, with the Vice President, or did he just… I know you went to Warsaw.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you have an opportunity to brief the Vice President on-
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did Ambassador Bolton?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	What do you remember, from what Ambassador Bolton shared with the Vice President, about the Zelensky meeting?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you brief Ambassador Bolton before he had an opportunity to meet with Vice President?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. But as far as you know, Ambassador Bolton communicated it to the Vice President that the goings on in Ukraine were positive?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	With President Zelensky. At this time, Ambassador Bolton was advocating for the lifting of the aid?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you participate in the Warsaw meetings?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	What do you remember from the meeting, with President Zelensky?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	What was the message? President Zelensky, he raised the issue of the aid, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	How did the Vice President respond?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Was there any discussion, during the meeting with President [inaudible 00:03: 01], on the part of the Vice President, about any of these investigations we’ve come to talk about?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So, Burisma wasn’t raised?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	2016 election wasn’t raised?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And the Vice President didn’t mention any investigations at all, did he?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You mentioned the August 28th Politico article. Was that the first time that you believe that Ukrainians may have had a real sense that the aid was on hold?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So, from the 55 day period, spanning July 18th through September 11th, it didn’t really become public until August 28th?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay, Ambassador Volker, is that also your recollection?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That it wasn’t until the Politico article that-
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Can you share a little bit with us about your communications, during that time period, about the hold in the aid?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	During this time period, did you come to believe that any of these investigations were part of the hold up in the aid?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Backtracking just a little bit. On July 3rd, you met in Toronto with President Zelensky, and there’s been some… Ambassador Taylor, and Mr. Kent provided some testimony that they had some apprehension, that part of this irregular channel, that Ambassador Taylor referenced, what would rear its head in Toronto. I’m just wondering if you can tell us whether that in fact happened.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. During that meeting in Toronto, or the series of meetings, there was no discussion of preconditions, and investigations of anything?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That sort?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you were there with Mr. Kent?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And did you ever have any discussions with him about preconditions or investigations?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. At any point in time had Mr. Kent raised any concerns to you about any of this?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Next event I want to cover is the July 10th meeting, in Ambassador Bolton’s office. We talked a little bit about it this morning. I don’t if you had caught the coverage, but there was a testimony that at some point Ambassador Sondland mentioned investigations, and reportedly that the meeting ended abruptly. What can you tell us about that, in fact?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And to the best of your knowledge, there certainly was no precondition discussed, right?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. A couple weeks later, the July 25th call happened, and you were headed to Ukraine, during that time period?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you receive readouts both from the U.S. side and the Ukrainian side. Could you tell us about it?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you ever have any discussions with Ambassador Taylor about this?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You had a meeting with President Zelensky on the 26th?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Were any of these concerning? Elements that some witnesses have raised about the call, raised in the meeting with President Zelensky?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So, to the extent there’s been assertions that President Zelensky was concerned about demands President Trump had made.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You don’t recall that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. There was no discussion, on the part of President Zelensky, on how to navigate the various…
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Concerns that people have articulated about the call.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mr. Zeldin asked you in the deposition that in no way, shape or form, in either readouts from the United States, or Ukraine, did you receive any indication whatsoever for anything that resembled a quid pro quo? Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And the same would go for this new allegation of bribery?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. It’s the same common set of facts. It’s just instead of quid pro quo, now it’s bribery.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Or extortion?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Of course.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Yes.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Right. Okay.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. At that point in time, you didn’t know that the potential pause in the security assistance was brewing?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Absolutely.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You testified in your deposition to the extent that Ukrainians were going to investigate other Ukrainians for wrongdoing, that was perfectly appropriate in your mind?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So, if certain Ukrainians involved with the Burisma company, if they-
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent, last Wednesday told us about there was an investigation, into Burisma, trying to recoup millions of taxpayer dollars, and the Ukrainians were pursuing an investigation, there was a bribe paid. Were you tracking that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Subsequent to those facts, and the bribe being paid, the Burisma company wanted to improve their image, and added some folks to their board, including the President of Poland, including Hunter Biden. Are you familiar with that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	To the extent the Ukrainians, that the folks affiliated with Burisma wanted to hire those people for their board, for protection purposes, so they could continue to engage in misdeeds. If that was a fact worth investigating, you certainly would be supportive of Ukrainians trying to get to the bottom of that, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	All right. Mr. Morrison, I want to turn our attention back to the July 25th call. You were in the room. Did anything concern you on the call?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	After the call ended, you, like Colonel Vindman, one of your next steps was to engage the NSC lawyers, and your reasons for doing that were slightly different than Colonel Vindman’s. You articulated three concerns, and do you want to share them with us, or would you rather I do it?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You were concerned about it leaking, because you were worried about how it would play out in Washington’s polarized political environment, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You were also worried how that would lead to the bipartisan support, here in Congress, towards Ukraine, right?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You were also concerned that it might affect the Ukrainians perception negatively?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In fact, all three of those things have played out, haven’t they?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You didn’t ask the lawyers to put it on the codeword system, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. You just wanted the transcript to be controlled?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. When you learned that the transcript had been stored on the compartmented server, you believe that was a mistake, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So, to the best of your knowledge, there’s no malicious intent, in moving the transcript to the compartmented server?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	To your knowledge, anybody on the NSC staff that needed access to the transcript for their official duties, always was able to access it, correct? people that had a need to know, and a need to access it.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Yeah.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. The Memcon of the July 25th call was, in your experience, prepared normally?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	There isn’t an exact transcription of what’s said on the call, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That there’s note-takers in the situation room, and then they prepare a draft, and it’s circulated among relevant parties?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You had responsibility for coordinating any edits?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Colonel Vindman testified that he thought it was very accurate. Did you as well?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Colonel Vindman did articulate that he had a couple edits. He wanted Burisma inserted, I think it was on page three, or four, in place of “the company”, in one of the sections where President Zelensky was talking. Are you aware of that edit request?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. At the time, did you understand that he had asked for that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Yeah. On page four, he wanted to swap out the word company for Burisma. When that edit from Colonel Vindman was not installed, did he give you any negative feedback? That it was crucial that that edit get in the document?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Did he ever raise any concerns to you about the accuracy of the transcript?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did he ever raise any concerns to you generally about the call?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. You indicated in your deposition that when you took over the portfolio for Dr. Hill, July 15th, you were alerted to potential issues in Colonel Vindman’s judgment?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did she relay anything specifically to you, why she thought that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Did any other NSC personnel raise concerns with you about Mr. Vindman?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Or I’m sorry, Colonel Vindman. What were some of those concerns that were brought to your attention?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Well, during the deposition I asked you, Mr. Morrison, whether others raised the concern that Colonel Vindman may have leaked information.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Yeah, and your answer was?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. I asked you whether you were concerned Colonel Vindman did not keep you in the loop at all times, with his official duties?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In fact, when he went to the national security council lawyers following July 25th call, he did not first come to you. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And you were his supervisor in the chain of command, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In hindsight, did you wish that he had come to you first, before going to the lawyers?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And why is that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. At any point subsequently, did he become frustrated that he felt cut out of some of the Ukraine portfolio?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And what was the nature of his concerns?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. And did ever get the sense that you resolved his concerns, or did they linger?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Before my time expires, Ambassador Volker, I want to turn quickly to what Ambassador Taylor describes as the irregular channel. He was a participant with you, and Ambassador Sondland hundreds of text messages, correct?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did he ever raise concerns, about what was going on during the time period of the early August time period?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did he ever engage you in a one-on-one telephone call, to articulate his concerns?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. You’re a experienced diplomat, at one point in time Senate confirmed, Ambassador Sondland is the Ambassador to the European Union, secretary Perry is a Secretary of energy. Certainly not… Doesn’t sound like an irregular bunch. Did he ever articulate to you that he thought the three of you working on Ukraine policy was a problem?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Were you surprised during his testimony, when he came in for the deposition, when he established these two tracks, that one was a regular channel that he was in charge of, and the other was a irregular channel?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Okay. Thank you.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Chair. Do you expect any more of these magical 15 minute of devotions that you come up with in the back?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Do you expect you’re going to have more this evening? Are you, or this is your last-
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you gentleman. So for everyone watching, this is another example of how out of control this process has become, where the Democrats just magically give themselves additional minutes. Which they’re right, in the little special rule that they wrote, they can do. But you’d at least think that they’d have the decency to just tell us that you’re going to have 15 minutes more.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And I would say that you can go four hours. We can go five hours. We’ll give you all you want. You can keep digging if you want. The deeper the hole you dig, the more viewers will turn off, because people just aren’t buying the drug deal that you guys are trying to sell.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I would add that since we are getting into prime time, these are two witnesses that were your witnesses that you called in to depose. We still ask for witnesses that you did not depose, including the whistleblower, who you and others claimed not to know. Which we still need to get to bottom of that, because it is the most important material fact witness, to how this whole mess began in the first place.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Secondly, we’ve asked for the DNC operatives that were working with Ukrainians to dig up dirt for what you call, or what the left calls conspiracy theories. Which they are right, they are conspiracy theories of dirt that they dug up to spin their own conspiracy theories to attack the Trump campaign in the 2016 election. So I have no more questions for these witnesses. I know our members do. Mr Caster, you have a little bit of a cleanup here.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I have nothing more. Would the gentleman allow us to use our magic minutes to yield to one of our members who’d like to go?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	We yield back.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So you took two additional minutes. Are you giving our side seven minutes?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I recognize Mr. Turner.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you. As the first day of this week’s impeachment TV marathon draws to a close, I’d like to remind the American people what we’re watching. The public hearings are the culmination of three years of incessant Democrat efforts to find a crime to impeach the President. First, they tried to manufacture evidence that the President colluded with Russia. To accomplish this task, the DNC and the Clinton Campaign worked with a former British spy, Christopher Steele. Steele assembled a dossier of false information, alleging the Trump Campaign colluded with Russia.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That dossier was largely assembled from Russian and Ukrainian sources that the Democrat contractors worked with. Next, they primed their hopes on the work of Robert Mueller. Mueller spent two years and millions of taxpayer dollars seeking evidence of a crime that we know wasn’t committed. Mueller’s failure was a devastating blow to Democrats, who clearly hoped his work to be the basis for the removal of the President. Today, we are witnessing the Ukraine hoax, the direct-to-TV sequel to the Russia collusion hoax. The plot of the Ukraine hoax is hard to follow. It shifts from day to day. First, the Democrats claim they had evidence of quid pro quo, then extortion and witness intimidation. Now, Democrats are pinning their hopes on bribery. Like any good Hollywood production, Democrats needed a screen test before releasing their latest attack on the President. They leveraged the secrecy of the House Intelligence Committee to interview a cast of characters in preparation for these public hearings.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	With the media’s enthusiastic support, they built a narrative abased on selectively leaked testimony. Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats on this committee are seeking the truth, they would want to know the answers to the following questions that they refuse to ask. To what extent did the whistleblower coordinate with the Democrats on this committee, and/or his staff? What is the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump Campaign in 2016? Why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden, and what did he do for them, and did his position impact any US government actions under the Obama administration?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The American people were promised a grave and somber impeachment inquiry, instead they got the salacious spy screen comedy that they’ve been working on for three years. Good night, see you in the morning.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thanks, gentlemen. I’d like to address a few brief words to the American people watching at home. If you watched the impeachment hearings last week, you may have noticed a disconnect between what you actually saw and the mainstream media accounts describing it. When you saw three diplomats who disliked President Trump’s Ukraine policy discussing secondhand and third-hand conversations about their objections with the Trump policy. Meanwhile, they admitted they had not talked to the President about these matters and they were unable to identify any crime or impeachable offense the President committed.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	But what you read in the press were accounts of shocking, damning, and explosive testimony that fully supports the Democrats accusations. If these accounts have a familiar ring, it’s because this is the same preposterous reporting the media offered for three years on the Russian hoax. On a nearly daily basis, the top news outlets in America reported breathlessly on the newest bombshell revelations showing that President Trump and everyone surrounding him were Russian agents. It really wasn’t long ago that we were reading these headlines. From CNN, “Congress Investigating Russian Investment Fund Ties to Trump Officials.” This was false.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	New York Times, “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated contacts with Russian Intelligence.” Also, false. “Slate was a Trump Server Communicating with Russia.” This was false. New York Magazine, “Will Trump Be Meeting with His Counterpart or His Handler?” This was false. The Guardian, “Manafort Held Secret Talks with Assange in Ecuadorian Embassy.” Also, false. Buzzfeed, “President Trump Directed His Attorney to Lie to Congress About the Moscow Tower Project.” All of these were false. There was no objectivity or fairness in the media’s Russia stories, just as a fevered rush to tarnish and remove a President who refuses to pretend that the media are something different from what they really are, puppets of the Democratic party.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	With their bias misreporting on the Russia hoax, the media lost confidence of millions of Americans, and because they refuse to acknowledge how badly they botched the story, they’ve learned no lessons and simply expect Americans will believe them as they try to stoke yet another partisan frenzy. In previous hearings, I’ve outlined three questions the Democrats in the media don’t want asked or answered. Instead of shedding light on these crucial questions, the media are trying to smother and dismiss them. Those questions start with, what is the full extent of the Democrats’ prior coordination with the whistleblower, and who else did the whistleblower coordinate this effort with?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The media have fully accepted the Democrats stunning reversal on the need for the whistleblower to testify to this committee. When the Democrats were insisting on his testimony, the media wanted it too, but things have changed since it became clear the whistleblower would have to answer problematic questions that include these. What was the full extent of the whistleblowers’ prior coordination with Chairman Schiff, his staff, and any other people he cooperated with while preparing the complaint? What are the whistleblowers’ political biases and connections to Democratic politicians? How does the whistleblower explain the inaccuracies in the complaint?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	What contact did the whistleblower have with the media, which appears to be ongoing? What are the sources of the whistleblowers’ information? Who else did he talk to and was the whistleblower prohibited by law from receiving or conveying any of that information? The media have joined the Democrats in dismissing the importance of cross-examining this crucial witness. Now that the whistleblower has successfully kickstarted impeachment, he has disappeared from the story, as if the Democrats put the whistleblower in their own witness protection program. My second question, what was the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump campaign?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In these depositions and hearings, Republicans have cited numerous indications of Ukraine meddling in the 2016 elections to oppose the Trump campaign. Many of these instances were reported, including the posting of many primary source documents by veteran investigative journalist, John Solomon. Since the Democrats switched from Russia to Ukraine for their impeachment crusade, Solomon’s reporting on Burisma, Hunter Biden and Ukraine election meddling has become inconvenient for the Democratic narrative, and so the media is furiously smearing and libeling Solomon. In fact, the publication, The Hill, told its staff yesterday it would conduct a review of Solomon’s Ukraine reporting.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Coincidentally, the decision comes just three days after a Democrat on this committee told a Hill writer that she would stop speaking to The Hill because it had run Solomon’s stories and she urged the writer to relay her concerns to Hills’ management. So now that Solomon’s reporting is a problem for the Democrats, it’s a problem for the media as well. I’d like to submit for the record, John Solomon’s October 31st story entitled, Debunking Some of Ukraine Scandal Myths About Biden and Election Interference. I encourage viewers today to read this story and draw your own conclusions about the evidence Solomon has gathered. I ask unanimous consent that we put this into the record, Mr. Chair?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The concerted campaign by the media to discredit and disown some of their own colleagues is shocking. And we see it again in the sudden denunciations of New York Times reporter, Ken Vogel, as a conspiracy theorist after he covered similar issues, including a 2017 political piece entitled, Ukrainian Efforts to Sabotage Trump Backfire. My third question, why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden? What did he do for them and did his position affect any US government actions under the Obama administration? We have now heard testimony from the Democrats’ own witnesses that diplomats were concerned about a conflict of interest involving Hunter Biden.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That’s because he had secured a well paid position, despite having no qualifications on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company, while his father was Vice President charged with overseeing Ukrainian issues. After trying out several different accusations against President Trump, the Democrats have recently settled on bribery. According to widespread reports, they replaced their quid pro quo allegation because it wasn’t polling well. But if the Democrats in the media are suddenly so deeply concerned about bribery, you would think they would take some interest in Burisma paying Hunter Biden $83,000 a month, and you think they would be interested in Joe Biden threatening to withhold US loan guarantees unless the Ukrainians fired a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	That would be a textbook example of bribery. The media, of course, are free to act as Democrat puppets, and they’re free to lurch from the Russia hoax to the Ukraine hoax at the direction of their puppet masters. But they cannot reasonably expect to do so without alienating half the country who voted for the President they’re trying to expel. Americans have learned to recognize fake news when they see it, and if the mainstream press won’t give it to them straight, they’ll go elsewhere to find it, which is exactly what the American people are doing. With that, I yield back.  Jennifer Williams Opening Statement
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you, Ms. Williams. Welcome.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I want to just establish a few basic facts about your knowledge, Ukraine, Burisma and the role of the Bidens.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You spend an extraordinary amount of your time on Ukraine, correct? Ukraine is [crosstalk 00:00:15].
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And it’s in your portfolio?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	First off, were you aware in September of 2015 then, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt publicly called for an investigation and this ends it into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma. Were you aware of these public statements?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You are today though?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know of anti-Trump efforts by various Ukrainian officials as well as Alexandra Chalupa, a DNC consultant?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know about the deputy assistant secretary of state Kent’s concerns about potential conflict of interest into Hunter Biden’s sitting on the board of Burisma?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In the last year or so?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that financial records show a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma routed more than $3 million to American accounts tied to Hunter Biden?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Until?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You prepared for this hearing?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You’ve been following it more closely?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Burisma is American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after vice president Biden forced the firing of the country’s chief prosecutor?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Yeah [crosstalk 00:02:09] and I’m not, none of these are trick questions. I’m just trying to get through them on the record.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Burisma lawyers pressured the state department in February 2016 after the raid and month before the firing of Shoken, and that they invoked Hunter Biden’s name as a reason to intervene?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Joe Biden called Ukrainian president Poroshenko at least three times in February 2016 after the president and owner of Burisma’s home was raided on February 2nd by the state prosecutor’s office?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you, Ms. Williams. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I’m going to ask you the same questions just to establish some basic facts about your knowledge about Ukraine, Burisma and the role of the Bidens. In September 2015 us ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt publicly called for an investigation into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma. Were you aware of these public statements?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	When did you become aware of them?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know of anti-Trump efforts by various Ukrainian government officials, as well as Alexandra Chalupa, a DNC consultant?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know about deputy assistant secretary of state’s Kent’s concerns about potential conflict of interest with Hunter Biden’s sitting on the board of Burisma?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that financial records show a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma routed more than $3 million to the American accounts tied to Hunter Biden.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Until recently?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Burisma’s American legal representatives met with Ukrainian officials just days after vice president Biden forced the firing of the country’s chief prosecutor?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Burisma lawyers pressure the state department in February 2016 after the raid and a month before the firing of Shoken that they invoked Hunter Biden’s name as a reason to intervene?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you know that Joe Biden called Ukrainian president Poroshenko at least three times in February 2016 after the president and owner of Burisma’s home was raided on February 2nd by the state prosecutor’s office?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ms. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, as you may or may not know, this committee has spent nearly three years conducting various investigations starting with the Russia collusion hoax, Pfizer abuse, democratic hysteria over the lack of collusion and the Mueller report, and now this impeachment charade. One of the most concerning things regarding all of these investigations is the amount of classified or otherwise sensitive information I read in the press that derive either from this committee or sources in the administration.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	To be clear, I’m not accusing either one of you of leaking information. However, given that you are the first witnesses who actually have some firsthand knowledge of the president’s call by listening in on July 25th. It’s imperative to the American public’s understanding of the events that we get a quick few matters out-of-the-way first. Ms. Williams, let me just go to you first. For the purposes of the following questions, I’m only asking about the time period between from July 25th to September 25th.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you discuss the July 25th phone call between president Trump and president Zelensky or any matters associated with a phone call with any members of the press?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	To be clear, you never discussed these matters with the New York Times, the Washington Post, Politico, CNN, or any other media outlet?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you ask or encourage any individual to share the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with any member of the press?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Do you know of any individual who discussed the substance of the July 25th phone call or matter associated with the call with any member of the press?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, the same questions for you. Did you discuss the July 25th phone call between president Trump and president Zelensky or any matter associated with a phone call with any member of the press?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Just to be clear, you did not discuss this with the New York Times, the Washington Post, Politico, CNN, or any other media outlet?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Did you ask or encourage any individual to share the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call or any member of the press?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Do you know of any individual who discussed the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with any member of the press?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Let me ask the question again. Do you know of any individual who discussed the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with any member of the press?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Right, but the question is [crosstalk 00:08:27].
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The question is, do you know any individual? Do you personally know any individual who discussed the substance of the July 25th phone call or any matter associated with the call with any member of the press?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you. Ms. Williams, did you discuss the July 25th phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25th or July 26th and if so, with whom?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ms. Williams, during your time on the NSC, have you ever accessed a colleague’s work computer without their prior authorization or approval?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Right, but representing the vice president?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you for that clarification. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, did you discuss the July 25th phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25th or the 26th, and if so, with whom?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Two individuals that were not in the White House?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And what agencies were these officials with?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	As you know, the intelligence community has 17 different agencies. What agency was this individual from?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	It’s our time [crosstalk 00:10:33].
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Please stop.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mr. Vindman, you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistleblower.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you testified in the deposition that you did not know who the whistleblower was, or is.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So how is it possible for you to name these people and then out the whistleblower?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Are you aware that this is the intelligence committee that’s conducting an impeachment hearing?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Wouldn’t the appropriate place for you to come to, to testify would be the intelligence committee about within the intelligence community?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Well this is a… I mean, you can really, you can plead the fifth, but you’re here to answer questions and you’re here under subpoena. So you can either answer the question or you can plead the fifth.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Counselor, what ruling is that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Well, we’ve attempted to subpoena the whistleblower to sit for a deposition. The chair is tabled that motion and then has been unwilling to recognize those motions over the last few days of this impeachment inquisition process. Oh, that’ll go to Mr. Castro.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, did you discuss the July 25th phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25th or the 26th? And if so, with whom?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Two individuals that were not in the White House?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And what agencies were these officials with?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	What, as you know, the intelligence community has 17 different agencies. What agency was this individual from?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	It’s our time, Mr. Chair.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mr. Vindman, you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistleblower?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you testified in the deposition that you did not know who the whistleblower was already.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	How is it possible for you to name these people and then out the whistleblower?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Are you aware that this is the intelligence committee that’s conducting an impeachment hearing?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Wouldn’t the appropriate place for you to come to testify would be the intelligence committee about someone within the intelligence community?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Well this is, I mean you can really, you can plead the Fifth, but you’re here to answer questions and you’re here under subpoena so you can either answer the question or you can plead the Fifth.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Counselor, what ruling is that?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Well, we’ve attempted to subpoena the whistleblower to sit for a deposition. The Chair has tabled that motion and then has been unwilling to recognize those motions over the last few days of this impeachment inquisition process. With that, I’ll go to Mr. Castro.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, before I turn to Mr. Jordan, I asked Ms. Williams about this, about, if she had ever accessed, without authorization, a fellow employee’s computer system. She answered no to the question. Have you ever accessed anyone’s computer system at the NSC without authorization?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Knowledge or authorization?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Knowledge or authorization, you never accessed someone’s computer without their knowledge or authorization?
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Mr. Jordan.
0201-11-19	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Well, act one of today’s circus is over. For those of you who have been watching it at home, the Democrats are no closer to impeachment than where they were three years ago. In the process, they’ve … The Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the IC, the ICIG, have all suffered longterm damage. The Democrats can continue to poison the American people with this nonsense. We sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment, which would be a very serious crime. “High crime and misdemeanors,” as it says in the Constitution. No such thing.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	In a July open hearing of this committee following publication of the Mueller report, the Democrats engaged in a last-ditch effort to convince the American people that President Trump is a Russian agent. That hearing was the pitiful finale of a three year long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election. After the spectacular implosion of their Russia hoax on July 24th in which they spent years denouncing any Republican, whoever shook hands with a Russian. On July 25th they turned on a dime and now claim the real malfeasance is Republican’s dealings with Ukraine. In the blink of an eye, we’re asked to simply forget about Democrats on this committee falsely claiming they had more than circumstantial evidence of collusion between President Trump and Russians. We should forget about them reading fabrications of Trump, Russia, collusion from the steel dossier into the congressional record.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	We should also forget about them trying to obtain nude pictures of Trump from Russian pranksters who pretended to be Ukrainian officials. We should forget about them leaking a false story to CNN while he was still testifying to our committee claiming that Donald Trump jr. was colluding with WikiLeaks. And forget about countless other deceptions, large and small that make them the last people on earth with the credibility to hurl more preposterous accusations at their political opponents.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And yet now here we are, we’re supposed to take these people at face value when they trot out a new batch of allegations. But anyone familiar with the Democrats, scorched earth war against President Trump would not be surprised to see all the typical signs that this is a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign. For example, after vowing publicly that impeachment requires bipartisan support, Democrats are pushing impeachment forward without the backing of a single Republican.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The witnesses deemed suitable for television by the Democrats were put through a closed-door audition process and a cult-like atmosphere in the basement of the Capitol where Democrats conducted secret depositions, released a flood of misleading and one-sided leaks and later selectively release transcripts in a highly staged manner. Violating their own guidelines Democrats repeatedly redacted from the transcripts the name of Alexandra Chalupa. A contractor for the Democratic National Committee who worked with Ukrainian officials to collect dirt on the Trump campaign, which she provided to the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Democrats rejected most of the Republican’s witness request, resulting in a horrifically one-sided process where the crucial witnesses are denied a platform if their testimony does not support the Democrats absurd accusations. Notably, they are trying to impeach the president for inquiring about Hunter Biden’s activities. Yet they refuse our request to hear from Biden himself.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The whistleblower was acknowledged to have a bias against President Trump, and his attorney touted a coup against the president and called for his impeachment just weeks after the election. At a prior hearing, Democrats on this committee, read out a purely fictitious rendition of the president’s phone call with President Zelensky. They clearly found the real conversation to be insufficient for their impeachment narrative, so they just made up a new one.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	And most egregiously the staff of the Democrats on this committee had direct discussions with the whistleblower before his or her complaint was submitted to the inspector general. Republicans can’t get a full account of these contacts because Democrats broke their promise to have the whistleblower testify to this committee. Democrat members hid these contacts from Republicans and then lied about them to the American people on national television.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I’ve noted before, the Democrats have a long habit of accusing Republicans of offenses they themselves are committing. Let’s recall for years they accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia when they themselves were colluding with Russia by funding and spreading the Steele dossier, which relied on Russian sources. And now they accused President Trump of malfeasance and Ukraine when they themselves are culpable. The Democrats cooperated in Ukrainian election meddling, and they defend Hunter Biden’s securing of a lavishly paid position with a corrupt Ukrainian company. All while his father served as vice president.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Despite this hypocrisy, the Democrats are advancing their impeachment sham, but we should not hold any hearings at all until we get answers to three crucial questions the Democrats are determined to avoid asking. First, what is the full extent of the Democrats prior coordination with the whistleblower? And who else did the whistleblower coordinate this effort with? Second, what is the full extent of Ukraine’s election meddling against the Trump campaign? And third, why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden and what did he do for them? And did his position affect any US government actions under the Obama administration? These questions will remain outstanding because Republicans were denied the right to call witnesses that know these answers.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	What we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance stage by the Democrats. Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, I’d like to welcome you here. I’d like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats star chamber additions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol. It seems you agreed witting or unwittingly to participate in a drama, but the main performance the Russia hoax has ended and you’ve been cast in the low rent Ukrainian sequel.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I’ll conclude by noting the immense damage the politicized bureaucracy has done to Americans’ faith in government. Though executive branch employees are charged with implementing the policies set by our president who is elected and responsible to the American people. Elements of the civil service have decided that they not the president are really in charge.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thus, as we’ll learn in these hearings. After expressing skepticism of foreign aid and concern about foreign corruption on the campaign trail, President Trump outraged the bureaucracy by acting skeptically about foreign aid and expressing concerns about foreign corruption. Officials alarm at the president’s actions was typically based on second hand, third hand, and even fourth hand rumors and innuendo. They believed it was an outrage for the president to fire an ambassador. Even though the president has full authority to retain or remove diplomats for any reason, at any time.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Officials show the surprising lack of interest in the indications of Ukrainian election meddling that deeply concerned the president at whose pleasure they serve. Despite all their dissatisfaction with President Trump’s Ukraine policy, the president approved the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Unlike the previous administration, which provided blankets as defense against invading Russians. By undermining the president, who they are supposed to be serving, the elements of the FBI, the Department of Justice, and now the State Department have lost the confidence of millions of Americans who believe that their vote should count for something. It will take years, if not decades, to restore faith in these institutions.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	This spectacle is doing great damage to our country. It’s nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime. With that, I yield back.  Bill Taylor Opening Statement
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The call summary for which the Democrats want to impeach President Trump is dramatically different from their nefarious depiction of it. What it actually shows is a pleasant exchange between two leaders who discuss mutual cooperation over a range of issues. The Democrats claim this call demonstrates extortion, bribery, and a host of other monstrous crimes being committed against President Zelensky. Yet President Zelensky himself insists there was nothing improper whatsoever about the conversation.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Indeed, the routine nature of the call helps to explain why in this committee’s last public hearing, Democrats recited a fictitious version of the call. Instead of reading the actual transcript, the Democrats depicted the President saying, quote, “I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it. On this and on that,” unquote. The transcript did not show President Trump saying anything remotely like that. The President did not ask Ukraine to make up dirt on anyone. But the Democrats are not trying to discover facts, they’re trying to invent a narrative. And if the facts they need do not exist, then they’ll just make it up.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Not only does President Zelensky deny the Democrats’ characterization of the call, but as Ambassador Taylor testified to this committee, the Ukrainians did not even know at the time of the call that a temporary delay was put on the security assistance for them. Furthermore, as the Ambassador testified, these holds occur from time to time. Both he and Ambassador Volker were confident the delay would be lifted. In fact, military aid to Ukraine has actually substantially improved since President Trump took office.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ambassador Taylor testified that President Trump was the first president to see that Ukraine was afforded Javelin anti-tank weapons. This was a very strong message that Americans are willing to provide more than blankets. This was the Obama Administration’s approach.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Note this important fact, the security assistance was provided to Ukraine without the Ukrainians having done any of the things they were supposedly being blackmailed to do. So we’re supposed to believe that President Trump committed a terrible crime that never actually occurred, and which the supposed victim denies ever happened.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I’d like to briefly speak about the core mistruth at the heart of the Democrats’ impeachment drive. They claim the President tried to get the Ukrainians to quote, “manufacture dirt against his political rivals.” This is supported by precisely zero evidence. Once again, the Democrats simply made it up.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	But let’s consider the broader question about why President Trump may have wanted answers to questions about Ukraine meddling in 2016. The Democrats downplay, ignore, outright deny the many indications that Ukrainians actually did meddle in the election. A shocking about-face for people who for three years argued that foreign election meddling was an intolerable crime that threatened the heart of our democracy.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	While the brazen suddenness of this U-turn is jarring, this denial is a necessary part of their argument. After all, if there actually were indications of Ukraine election meddling and if foreign election meddling is a dire threat, then President Trump would have a perfectly good reason for wanting to find out what happened. And since the meddling was aimed against his campaign, he’d have good reason for sending his personal attorney to make inquiries about it.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	What’s strange is that some of the witnesses at these hearings and previous depositions, who express alarm about these inquiries, were remarkably uninformed about these indications of Ukrainian election meddling, and why the President may have been concerned by them. For example, I noted previously, Alexandra Chalupa, former staffer for the Democratic National Committee, admitted to Politico that she worked with officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, DC to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign, which she passed on to the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Chalupa revealed that Ukrainian embassy officials themselves were also working directly with reporters to trade information and leads about the Trump campaign.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ambassador Kent, you didn’t seem to be too concerned about it in the last round of questioning, so I’ll just skip you because we know that wasn’t a concern. But Ambassador Taylor, you testified to this committee that you only recently became aware of reports of this cooperation between Ukrainian embassy officials and Chalupa to undermine the Trump campaign from your last deposition. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Yes. I’m just going over your last deposition-
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	… Ambassador.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	The Politico article cites three named Ukrainian officials asserting that the Ukrainian embassy supported the Hillary Clinton campaign. It quotes Ukrainian parliamentarian, Andrey Artemenko, saying quote, “It was clear they were supporting Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. They did everything from organizing meetings with the Clinton team, to publicly supporting her, to criticizing Trump. I think that they simply didn’t meet with the Trump campaign because they thought Hillary would win,” unquote.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ambassador Taylor, you testified you were unfamiliar with that statement. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You also said you were unaware that then Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Valeriy Chaly, wrote an op-ed in The Hill during the 2016 presidential campaign criticizing then candidate Trump. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You said you did not know that Serhiy Leshchenko, then a Ukrainian parliamentarian, had admitted that part of his motivation and spreading information about the so-called “black ledger,” a disputed document purporting to reveal corruption by a former Trump campaign official, was to undermine the Trump’s candidacy. This was in your deposition. Is that still correct?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Taylor.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Fusion GPS contractor, Nellie Ohr, testified to Congress that Leshchenko was a source for Fusion GPS’s operation to dirty up the Trump campaign. Including the compilation of the Steele dossier, on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton campaign.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You testified you were unaware that Leshchenko served as a source for that project. Ambassador Taylor, is this still correct?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	You said you did not know that Ukrainian Internal Affairs minister, Arsen Avakov, mocked and disparaged then candidate Trump on Facebook and Twitter. Is that still correct?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Ambassador Taylor, in your testimony to this committee, you said you were never briefed on these reports and statements. That you did not do due diligence before taking your post to discover the President’s and Mayor Giuliani’s concerns, what they may have been, and that you did not discuss them with Ambassador Yovanovitch. Is that still correct?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	Furthermore, you said it upset you to hear about the many indications of Ukrainian election meddling. Your precise words were, I’m going to read them back to you, “Based on this Politico article, which again, surprises me, disappoints me because I think it’s a mistake for any diplomat or government official in one country to interfere in the political life of another. That’s disappointing,” unquote. Ambassador Taylor, is that still your testimony?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	So I can understand that. Are you aware during the… I believe it was the 2012 election when, at the time, President Obama leaned over on a hot mic to the then Russian president and said that he’d have to wait until after the election. Was that inflammatory to the Ukrainians also?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I just want to be clear that some government officials opposed President Trump’s approach to Ukraine, but many had no idea what concerned him. In this case, it was numerous indications of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election to oppose his campaign and support Hillary Clinton. Once you know that, it’s easy to understand the President’s desire to get to the bottom of this corruption and to discover exactly what happened in the 2016 election.  Adam Schiff Questioning George Kent and Bill Taylor Part 2
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I think the gentleman has a different question about the rules, so what are the rules that are going to govern this?
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	I’m yielding to you to the question I just asked you.
2019-11-13	Devin Nunes	R-Nunes	Republican	To answer Mr. Ratcliffe’s question.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I thank the chairman. And it is interesting that again parliamentary inquiries and I believe some were actually, some of the things that I’m going to discuss today because we’re sort of coming here today in a different arena. For everybody who’s not been here before, this is a new room. It’s new rules. It’s a new month. We’ve even got cute little stickers for our staff so we can come in because we want to make this important, and this is impeachment because we’ve done such a terrible job of it in this committee before. But what’s not new is basically what’s just been reiterated by the chairman. What’s not new is the facts. What’s not new is it’s the same sad story.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	What’s interesting, even before I get into part of my opening statement was, is what was just said by the chairman. We went back to a redo of Mr. Mueller. We’re also quoting him, saying the attention of the American people should be on foreign interference. I agree with him completely, except I guess the American people did not include the judiciary committee because we didn’t take it up. We didn’t have hearings. We didn’t do anything to delve deeply into this issue. We passed election bills, but did not get into the in depth part of what Mr. Mueller talked about, taking his own report and having hearings about that. We didn’t do that. So I guess the American people doesn’t include the house judiciary committee. You know the interesting, we also just heard an interesting discussion. We’re going to have a lot of interesting discussion today about the constitution and other things, but we also talked about the founders.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	What’s interesting is that the chairman talked a lot about the founders from the quotes, and again this is why we have the hearing about the founders being concerned about foreign influence, but what he also didn’t quote was the founders being really, really concerned about political impeachment because you just don’t like the guy. You didn’t like him since November of 2016. The chairman has talked about impeachment since last year when he was elected chairman, two years ago in November 2017 before he was even sworn in as chairman. So don’t tell me this is about new evidence and new things and new stuff. We may have a new hearing room, we may have new minds and we may have chairs that aren’t comfortable, but this is nothing new folks.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	This is sad. So what do we have here today? You know what I’m thinking? I looked at this, and what is interesting is there’s two things that have become very clear. This impeachment is not really about facts. If it was, I believe the other committees would have sent over recommendations for impeachment. No, they’re putting it on this committee because if it goes badly, I guess they want to blame Adam Schiff’s committee, and others want to blame this committee for it going bad. But they’re already drafting articles. Don’t be even fooled. They’re already getting ready for this. We’ve already went after this with the Ukraine after numerous failings, the Mueller, Cohen and emoluments.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The list goes on. But the American people are failing to see us legislator. But if you want to know what’s really driving this, there’s two things. It’s called the clock and the calendar. The clock and the calendar. Most people in life, if you want to know what they truly value, you look at their clock. You look at their checkbook and their calendar. You know what they value. That’s what this committee values. Time. They want to do it before the end of the year. Why? Because the chairman said it just a second ago. Because we’re scared of the elections next year. We’re scared of the elections that we’ll lose again.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So we’ve got to do this now. The clock and the calendar are what’s driving impeachment, not the facts. When we understand this, that’s what the witnesses here will say today. What do we have here today? What is really interesting over today and for the next few weeks is America will see why most people don’t go to law school. No offense to our professors. But please, really, we’re bringing you in here today to testify on stuff that most of you have already written about, all four, for the opinions that we already know, out of the classrooms that maybe you’re getting ready for finals in, to discuss things that you probably haven’t even had a chance to see. Unless you’re really good on TV or watching the hearings for the last couple of weeks, you couldn’t have possibly actually digested the Adam Schiff report from yesterday or the Republican response in any real way.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Now we can be theoretical all we want, but the American people is really going to look at this and say, huh, what are we doing? Because there’s no fact witnesses planned for this committee. That’s an interesting thing. Frankly, there’s no plan at all except next week an ambiguous hearing on the presentation from the other committee that sent us the report and judiciary committee, which I’m not still sure what they want us to present on and nothing else. No plan. I asked the chairman before we left for Thanksgiving to stay in touch. Let’s talk about what we have because history will shine a bright light on us starting this morning.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Crickets, until I asked for a witness the other day and let’s just say that didn’t go well. There’s no whistle blower. And by the way, it was proved today that he’s not or she’s not afforded the protection of identity. It’s not in the statute. It’s just something that was discussed by Adam Schiff. We also don’t have Adam Schiff who wrote the report. He said yesterday in a press conference, “I’m not going to, I’ll send staff to do that.” He’s not going to. But to me if he was wanting to, he would come begging to us.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	But here’s the problem. It sums it up very simply like this. Just 19 minutes after noon on inauguration day 2017, the Washington Post ran the headline, the campaign to impeach the president has begun. Mark Zad, who would later become the attorney for the infamous whistleblower tweeted in January, 2017, “The coup has started, the impeachment will follow ultimately.” And in May of this year, Al Green says, “If we don’t impeach the president, he’ll get reelected.” If you want to know what’s happening, here we go.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Why did everything that I say up to this point about no fact witnesses, nothing. For the judiciary committee which spent two and a half weeks before this hearing was even held under Clinton, two and a half weeks. We didn’t even find your names out until less than 48 hours ago. I don’t know what we’re playing hide the ball on. It’s pretty easy what you’re going to say. We can’t even get that straight. So what are we doing for the next two weeks? I have no idea. The chairman just said an ambiguous report, but nothing else. If we’re going to simply not have fact witnesses when we are the rubber stamp hiding out back, the very rubber stamp the chairman talked about 20 years ago. What a disgrace to this committee, to have the committee of impeachment simply take from other entities and rubber stamp.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	You see, one of the things that I say matter about fact witnesses and actually hearing and actually having this a due process, because by the way, just a couple of months ago, the Democrats got all sort of dressed up, if you will, and says, we’re going to have due process protection for the present and good fairness throughout this. This is the only committee in which the president would even have a possibility. But no offense to you, the law professors, the president has nothing to ask you. You’re not going to provide anything he can’t read. And his attorneys have nothing else. Put witnesses in here that can be fact witnesses who can be actually cross-examined. That’s fairness. And every attorney on this panel knows that.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	This is a sham. But you know what I also see here is quotes like this. “There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment supported by one of our major political parties or imposed by another. Such an impeachment will produce divisiveness, bitterness, and politics for years to come and will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions. The American people are watching. They will not forget. You have the votes. You may have the muscle, but you do not have legitimacy of a national consensus or the constitutional imperative. The partisan coup d’etat will go down in infamy in the history of the nation.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	How about this one? “I think the key point is that the Republicans are still running a railroad job with no attempt at fair procedure. And today when the Democrats offered amendments, offered motions in committee to say we should first discuss and adopt standards so that we know what we’re dealing with, standards for impeachment that was voted down or ruled out of order. When we say the important thing is to start looking at the question before we simply have a vote with no real inquiry first, that was voted down and ruled out of order. So frankly, the whole question of what material should be released and what is secondary, but that’s all we discussed. The essential question, and here it is, which is to set up a fair process as to whether the country put this country through an impeachment proceeding. That was ruled out of order. The Republicans refused to let us discuss it.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Those were all chairman Nadler before he was chairman, I guess 20 years makes a difference. This an interesting time. We’re having a factless impeachment. You just heard a one sided presentation of facts about this president. Today we will present the other side, which it gets so conveniently left out. Remember, fairness does dictate that, but maybe not here because we’re not scheduling anything else. I have a democratic majority who has poll tested what they think they ought to call what the president they think he did. Wow. That’s not following the facts. We have just a deep seated hatred of a man who came to the White House and did what he said he was going to do. The most amazing question I got in the first three months of this gentleman’s presidency from reporters was this, “Can you believe he’s putting forward those ideas?
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I said, yes. He ran on them. He told the truth, and he did what he said. The problem here today is this will also be one of the first impeachments. The chairman mentioned there was two of them, one before he resigned, one in Clinton, in which the facts even by Democrats and Republicans were not really disputed. In this one, they’re not only disputed, they’re contradictive of each other. There are no set facts here. In fact, there’s not anything that presents an impeachment here except a president carrying out his job in the way the constitution saw that he sees fit to do it. This is where we’re at today. So the interesting thing that I come to with most everybody here is this may be a new time, a new place, and we may be all scrubbed up and looking pretty for impeachment.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	But this is not an impeachment. This is just a simple railroad job. And today’s is a waste of time because this is where we’re at. So I close today with this. It didn’t start with Mueller. It didn’t start with a phone call. You know where this started? It started with tears in Brooklyn in November, 2016 when the election was lost. So we are here, no plan, no fact witnesses, simply being a rubber stamp for what we have. But hey, we’ve got law professors here. What a start of a party. Mr. Chairman, before I yield back, I have a motion. Under clause two, rule 11.  Pamela Karlan Opening Statement
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr. Chairman, how am I recorded?
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Good luck.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Thank you Mr. chairman. Before I begin on the questions, I do want to revisit a comment that was made earlier by you, Mr. chairman. It was our demand from minority hearing day, and you stated you would rule on it later. I just wanted to remind you the rules of the house do not permit a ruling on this. They do not permit a vote and you cannot shut it down. And according to your own words, the minority is entitled the day of hearings. It’s a right, rarely exercise. But it’s guards against the majority abusing his power to exclude competing views. Call it the fair and balanced rule.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	It’s not the chairman’s right to determine whether we deserve a hearing. It’s not the chairman’s right to decide whether prior hearings were sufficient. It’s not the chairman’s right to decide whether or what we say or think is acceptable. It is certainly not the chairman’s right to violate the rules in order to interfere with our right to conduct a hearing. And I just commend Mr. Sensenbrenner for bringing that forward and look forward to that schedule that you’re getting that scheduled expeditiously.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Moving on. Interesting part. Now we hit phase two. You’ve had one side and I have to say it was eloquently argued by not only the council and by the witnesses involved, but there is always a phase two. A phase two is what is problematic here. Because as I said in my opening statement, this is one that would be, and for many, one of the most disputed impeachments on just the facts themselves.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	What was interesting is we actually showed videos of witnesses. In fact, one of them was an opening statement again, I believe. Which again, the closest thing to perfect outside your resume, this side of heaven is an opening statement, because it’s unchallenged. And I agree with that. And it should be. And we’ve had great witnesses here today to talk about this. But we didn’t talk about anything about Kurt Volker who said nothing about it. We said nothing about the AB and Hella Morrison who contradicted Venireman and others. We’ve not done that.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	And I don’t expect the majority too, because that’s not what they’re here for. They’re not here to give exculpatory evidence. Just like the shift report gives nothing of exculpatory evidence. And also there’s still evidence being withheld by Adam Schiff that is not come to this committee and we still not got any of the underlying stuff that came from that investigation that, according to [inaudible 01:11:24] 60, we believe we’re supposed to get.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	One being the very important part is the inspector general, the [inaudible 01:11:30] inspector general. His testimony is still being held. And there’s a quote secret on it or they’re holding it in classification. Last time I checked, we have plenty of places in his building and other buildings to handle classified information if they still want to do that. But it’s being withheld from us. I have to believe, now there is a reason it’s being withheld. Because undoubtedly, there’s a problem with it, and we’ll just have to see as that goes forward.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So anybody in the media, anybody watching today, the first 45 minutes we went through have painted a very interesting picture. It’s painted an interesting picture that goes back many, many years. It paints an interesting picture of picking and choosing which part of the last few weeks we want to talk about. And that’s fine because we’ll have the rest of the day to go about this. But professor Turley, you’re now well rested. And you’ve got one question. You were asked a yes, no only, and not given to elaborate, but I’m going to start here. Let’s just do this.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Elaborate if you would, because you tried to when the question it was asked to you. And then if there’s anything else that you’ve heard this morning that you would disagree with or have, and for some, I will go ahead and allow you some time to talk. By the way, just for the information, Mr. chairman, this is the coldest hearing room in the world. And also for those of you who are worried about, I’m uncomfortable, upset, I’m happy as a Lord. But this chair is terrible. I mean it is amazing. But Mr. Turley, go ahead.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	[inaudible 00:01:13:03].
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	No, you’re doing a good job. Go ahead.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Let’s continue on with some fact what you’ve been talking about. First of all, the McDonald case. How was that decided? Was that a very split court? Were they really torn about that? That case came out? How?
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	One of the things that you said also, and I think it could be summed up, and I use it sometimes as what’s the layman’s language here, is facts don’t matter. And that’s what I heard a lot of in the 45 minutes. Well, the facts said this, or the facts are disputed this. But if this, if that, if this, it rises to an impeachment level. And that will, sort of what you’re saying that crimes… I think your word was crimes have meanings. And I think this is the concern that I have. Is there a concern that if we just say it that facts don’t matter, that we’re also, as you’ve said, abusing our power as we go forward here and looks, looking at what people would actually deem as an impeachable offense?
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr., I have a question on that. Because you brought up Mr. Obama, you brought up other presidents in this process. Is there not an obligation by the office of the president? We’ll just use that term not to be Obama, Trump, Clinton. Anyway. In their obligation by the president to actually assert the constitutional privileges or authorities that have been given or when accused of something or crime or anything else.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I think that’s something that is, again, not pointed out when you’re doing a back and forth, what we’re doing. The transcript of the call released, the things that have been released to the Mueller. We go back through this. There has been a work in progress by this administration. I think the interesting point that I want to talk about is two things. Number one, Congress has abused of its own power, which has not been discussed here. Even internally, where we have had committees not willing to let members see transcripts, not being willing to give those up under the guise of impeachment or you shouldn’t be able to say them. Although the rules of the house were never invoked to stop that.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	What we’re seeing here and I want to add something else before we move on to something else is the timing issue that you’ve talked about here. Again, I believe we talked about this with the Mueller report. We talked about this with everything else. This is one of the fastest… You know, we’re on track. I said this earlier, we’re on a clock. The clock in the calendar or seemingly dominating this is irregardless of what anybody in this community, and especially members not of this committee, to think about what we’re actually seeing of fact witnesses and people moving forward. We don’t have that yet.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So the question becomes is, an election pending, when facts are in dispute, and you made a to mention this, this is one in which the facts are not unanimous. There’s not universal, there’s not even bipartisan agreement on the facts and what they lead to, especially when there’s exculpatory evidence that has been presented not in a Schiff report, but in other reports. Does that timing bother you from a historical perspective, not only in the past, but moving forward as well?
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	And again, let’s go back. I want to go back to something else. And you talked about robbery. And Mr. Taylor is going to address all a good bit of that. But I want to go back to something that you talked about, because it really bothers, I think the perception out there of what’s going on here in the disputed transcript being the… You know, the call has been laid out there. The president said I wanted nothing for this. There’s all this exculpatory evidence. It was not presented in the last 45 minutes. But there is one thing that’s interesting is… And it’s been reported in the mainstream media and it goes back to your issue, does crimes matter or what this definition is. Our majority initially accused the president. They kept saying quid pro quo and we still hear it as we go through.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	But then, as reported, they used a political focus group to determine whether the phrase polled well, and apparently it didn’t poll well, so they agreed to change their theory of the case to bribery. Does that not just feed into more of what you’re saying about how we’re actually the crime matters and that facts do matter in a case like it or at least should matter?
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I think that’s the problem right now that many members of this house member, members of this body and especially the American public are looking at that if you say he’s above law but then you don’t define it or you can find the facts to whatever you want to have. That is the ultimate railroad that everybody in this country should not be afforded. Everyone is afforded due process. Everyone is afforded the process to actually make their case heard.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	That’s the concern that I have in this committee right now. And we’ve already seen it voted down that we’re not going to look at certain fact witnesses. We’re not even been promised other hearings in which this committee, and the words and the concerns that echoed almost 20 years ago from the chairman where he did not want to take the advice of another body or entity giving us the judiciary committee a report and then acting as a rubber stamp if we didn’t do this.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Just as a reminder, it was almost two and a half weeks before the discussion of this kind of a hearing back then, before the hearing actually took place. These are the kind of things that as timing goes… I think the obvious point here is that timing is becoming more of the issue because the concern has been stated before about elections. They’re more concerned about trying to fit the facts in to what the president supposedly did, presumably did, and make those hypotheticals stick to the American public.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The problem is their timing, the definition of crimes, the definition of the fact that bribery has defined by the Supreme court is not making their case. It’s not fitting what they need to do. The issue that we have to deal with going forward is, why the rush? Why do we still not have the information from the intelligence committee? Why is the Inspector General’s report from the ICT committee being withheld even in a classified setting.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	These are the problems that you have now highlighted, and I think that need to be… And this is why the next 45 minutes and the rest of the day is going to be applicable. Because both sides matters. And at the end of the day, this is a fast impeachment. The fastest we’re saying, based on disputed facts on crimes or disturbances that are made up with the facts to fit each part. With that, I’m going to turn it over to my counsel, Mr. Tyler.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	This just keeps getting more amazing. I think we just put in the jury pool, the founding fathers and said, what would they think? I don’t think we have any idea what they would think in all due respect with this because of the different times, the different things that we’ve talked about. But also to in some way insinuate on a live mic with a lot of people listening that the founding fathers would have found President Trump guilty is just simply malpractice with these facts before us. That is just simply pandering to a camera. That is simply just not right.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I mean, this is amazing. We can disagree. What’s amazing on this committee is we don’t even disagree on the facts. We cannot even find a fact right now with it is not going through the public testimony and also even the transcripts at all that is not. Mr. Turley, are we going to deputize somebody between now and the founders into the jury pool here?
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I think one of the things that came out just a second ago was also this discussion of, and we had had this discussion earlier about is it the presidential prerogative and also members of the president’s cabinet to assert privileges and rights and we talked about the fast and furious with President Obama. Remember, Attorney General Holder was held in contempt by this body for withholding and not complying with subpoenas. I mean you just can’t pick and choose history here what you want to have, but I think also you just made a statement and it was brought up earlier talking about bad practice.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	It is also the law of the land that we are supposed to ensure that countries given aid are not corrupt. And I think this is also the something’s missing from this discussion as well. If their president has had a long seated distrust, a foreign country, especially Ukraine and others with a history of corruption. I made this statement earlier. It’s in the report from the hipsy side on our side. 68% of those polled in the Ukraine over the previous year had bribed a public official. Ukraine had corruption issues. It came back from the Obama Administration, it came through the Trump Administration, and our rule is that they have to actually look at the corruption before giving taxpayer dollars.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The president was doing that and now it has been blown up because we’ve now found in this hearing today, facts really don’t matter if we’re trying to fit it into a law or fitting into a breaking of rule that we want to impeach on. And as I’ve said, the reason we’re doing this is the train is on the track. This is a clock calendar impeachment, not a fact impeachment. I yield back.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, today has been interesting, I guess to say the least. We have found many things. In fact, three of our four witnesses here today alleged numerous crimes committed by the president. And at times it seemed like we were even trying to make up crimes as we go out. Well, if it wasn’t this, well it was the intent to do it. It went along that is interesting today as I started this day, and I’m going to come back to it now. As much as I respect these who came before us today, this is way too early, because we’ve not as a committee done our job. We’ve not as a committee come together, looked at evidence, taken fact witnesses, put people here in front of us under oath to say what happened and how did it happen and why did it happen? We’re taking the work of the Intel Committee and the other committees, we’re taking it as seemingly at face value and I will remind all that the chairman even is the biggest proponent of this not happening in his earlier statements almost 20 years ago when he said we should not take a report from another entity and just accept it, otherwise we are a rubber stamp.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Now to my democratic majority, they may not care, because as I’ve said before, this is about a clock and a calendar. A clock and a calendar. They’re so obsessed with the election next year that they just gloss over things. In fact, what is interesting is as I said earlier, three of the four witnesses alleged numerous crimes committed by the president. However, during the Intel Committee hearings, none of the fact witnesses identified a crime. If you’re writing about this, that should alarm you.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So this impeachment narrative being spun by the majority is a fake one. It’s majority spinning 3% of the facts, while ignoring 97% of the other. In fact, Professor Turley earlier said today, impeachment needs proof, not presumptions. We have one of the fact witnesses in the Intel Committee, I presumed that was what was going on. Mr. Sondland.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	You know what is happening here today is also we found out today… I thought was really interesting. This is the Judiciary Committee, but we also found out today that facts don’t matter. In fact, facts don’t matter unless we can fit those facts to fit the narrative we want to spin before this committee and the American people. If they don’t matter, we also heard one of the witnesses state today that it doesn’t matter if aid was released or not. Of course it matters, but unfortunately the only one of the many facts ignored by the majority. They’re ignoring a ton of substantive facts that matter.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	It apparently doesn’t matter to the Democrats, that Ambassador Volker, the former special envoy to the Ukraine, made clear in his testimony there was no conditionality on the White House meeting or the aid. The Democrats and their witnesses haven’t mentioned that, because it’s unhelpful to the narrative they’re spinning. It’s apparently doesn’t matter that Democrats, to the Democrats and a majority here, that the president did not condition his aide on an investigation. In fact, Mr. Sondland’s statement is to the contrary, was presumption. It was right here in this room. He called it a guess, right where you’re sitting called it a guess, a presumption. It’s what he thought. God forbid if we walk into our courtrooms or in our proceedings now, then find somebody guilty of something we’re calling a crime and we walk into court now and all of a sudden, well, I thought it was, the witness that I presumed it was. God forbid, this is where we’re at.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	But we’ve also heard today that you can make inference though. It’s okay if you’re just inferring. I don’t know about the professors here. For those of us in court on both sides of the aisle. I’ve never heard anyone going in and hear a judge say just infer what you think they meant and that’ll be enough. It’s not inference.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	It probably doesn’t matter that the president didn’t condition a meeting on an investigation. He met with Zelensky with no preconditions. Zelensky didn’t even find out about the hold on the aid until it was after a month after the call when he read it in Politico. The aid was really shortly thereafter and the Ukraine didn’t have anything to do to get the aid release. Not only was the aid released, but lethal aid was given as well. And if you think that doesn’t matter, there were five meetings between the time the aid was stopped and the time the aid was released. And in none of those meetings between ambassadors and others, including the vice president and senators, none of that was ever connected to a promise of anything on the aid. Nothing was ever connected. Five times. And two of those were after President Zelensky learned that aid was being held.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Tell me there’s not a problem here with the story. That’s why fact witnesses aren’t here right now. The evidence against the president is really about policy differences. In fact, three of the democratic star witnesses Hill, Taylor and Kent weren’t even on the call. They read transcripts like everyone else. On July 26, Zelensky met with the Volker and Sondland and made no reference to quid pro quo or hold on aid. They met several more times, no references. But none of these inconvenient facts or so many other inconvenient facts matter to the majority.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Moreover, we don’t even know what, if additional hearings we will have to address other facts. This is the part that bothers me greatly. It is something we have seen from January of this year. No concern about a process that works, but simply a getting to an end that we want. I agree with Professor Feldman. He may find that strange, but I do agree with you on something. It’s not his job to assess the credibility of witnesses. It is this committee’s job. And I agree. But this committee can’t do our jobs if none of the witnesses testify before our committee, even ones that we have talked about calling today in the majority has said, we don’t want. To that, we still don’t have an answer on what this committee will do once this hearing ends. The committee received Mr. Chairman Schiff’s report yesterday, but we still don’t have the underlying evidence.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The rules even set up by this body are not being followed to this day, but yet nobody talks about it on the majority side. The witnesses produced by Chairman Schiff and American people talked about their feelings, their guesses, their presumptions. But even though the facts may not matter to the majority, 97% of the other facts do matter to the American people.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So my problem is this, as the ranking member of this committee, one of the oldest, most should be fact based, legal based committees we have here, where impeachment should have been all along. I have a group of members who have no idea where we’re headed next. I bet you though, if I asked the majority members outside the chairman, they don’t have a clue either, very much one. Because if they haven’t, they should share it, because this is not a time to play hide the ball. This is not a time to say we’re going to figure it out on the fly. You’re talking about overturning 63 million votes of a president duly elected who is doing his job every day. And by the way, it was overseas today while we’re doing this, working with our NATO allies.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So the question I have is where do we head next? We’ve heard this ambiguous presentation, but here’s my challenge, as I’ve already been voted down and tabled today. Mr. Schiff should testify. Chairman Schiff, not his staff, must appear before this committee to answer questions about the content of his report. That’s what Ken Starr did 20 years ago and history demand it. I told the chairman just a while ago and a couple of weeks ago when we’re doing a markup, I said, “Mr. Chairman, the history lights are on us. It is time that we talk and share how we’re going forward.” I’m still waiting for answers.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So Mr. Chairman, as we look ahead, as the democratic majority promised that this was going to be a fair process when it got to judiciary for the president and others. The president, and you may say he could have come today, what would have this done? Nothing. There’s no fact witnesses here. Nothing to rebut. In fact, it’s been a good time just to see that really nothing came of it at the end of the day. So why should he be here? Let’s bring fact witnesses in. Let’s bring people in because as you said, Mr. Chairman, you said, your words, we should never on this committee except a entity giving us a report and not investigating ourselves. Undoubtedly we’re well on our way to doing that because of a calendar and a clock.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So Mr. Chairman, I know you’re about to give a statement and they’ve worked on it and you’ve worked on it very hard, I’m sure. But I wanted, before you gavel this hearing, before you start your statement, before you go any further, I would like to know two things. Number one. When do you plan on scheduling our minority hearing day. And number two, why or with, when are we actually going to have real witnesses here that are fact witnesses in this case? When? Or what you said many years ago is faded just like the leaves in fall. I don’t really care anymore that somebody else gives us a report. Undoubtedly Chairman Schiff is chairman over everything with impeachment and he doesn’t get to testify. He’s going to send a staff member. But I don’t even know if we’re going to have a hearing past that to figure out anything that’s been going on.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So my question is, I started out today, is where is fairness? It was promised. It’s not being delivered. The facts talked about, were not facts delivered. This president, as facts were given, did nothing wrong, nothing to be impeached and nothing for why we’re here. And in the words of one of our witnesses, Mr. Turley, if you will rush through this, you do it on flimsy grounds. The American people will not forget the light of history.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So today, before you give your opening statement or your for closing statement, before you get to this time, my question is is will you talk to this committee? You’re chairman. You hold a very prestigious role. Will you let us know where we’re going? Are we going to adjourn from here after you sum up everything saying that they all did good and go out from here? We’re still wondering. The lights are on. It’s time to answer the question. I yield back.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a question. You can’t review a letter. That is a demand.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	There’s nothing for you to review.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr. Chairman. I have one thing.
2019-12-04	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Pursuant to committee rule eight, I am giving notice to intent to file dissenting views to the committee’s report on constitutional grounds for presidential impeachment.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	[inaudible 00:11:29] someone is asking you for [inaudible 00:11:26].
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So, you’re not going to recognize a possible motion before me?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Unanimous consent request.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	It’s a unanimous consent request.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Well that got us started, again. The chairman completely not answering a question. It is timely and it’s frankly not up to his discretion. But again, we’ve not really cared about that from the start, to begin with. So my question is, is just schedule the hearing, but undoubtedly that’s not what they want out there. So let’s start over. Now the chairman is recognized and we’ve got that point. There’ve been famous moments and impeachment. There’ve been famous moments and impeachment as we’ve gone forward. There are famous lines from Nixon like, what did the president know and when did he know it? From the Clinton impeachment there was, I did not have sex with that woman.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	What would be known about this one is probably, where’s the impeachable offense? Why are we here? I’ll tell you, this may though become known as the focus group impeachment because we don’t have a crime, we don’t have anything we can actually pin, and nobody understands really what the majority is trying to do, except to interfere and basically make sure that they believe the president can’t win next year if he’s impeached. The focus group impeachment takes words and then takes them to people and say, how can we explain this better because we don’t have the facts to match it?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	A focus group impeachment says, we really aren’t working with good facts but we need a good PR move. That’s why we’re here today. This is all about, as I said last week, a clock and a calendar. And it really became evident to me that this was true because last Wednesday, after we had a long day of hearing here. The next morning, before anything else could get started, the speaker of the house walked up to the podium and said, “go write articles of impeachment.” She just quit. She just stopped, go write articles of impeachment. I appreciate that the majority practice for two days this weekend on this hearing. I appreciate the fact that you got to try and get it right, to try and convince the American people of your problem. But your speaker has already undercut you. She took the thrill out of the room.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	You’re rotting artists of impeachment. Why couldn’t we just save that time today? And if you’re going to write the dog’s impeachment, go ahead and write them. Well, there’s probably a reason for that because the chairman laid out some amazing claims, none of which I think after this hearing today, the American people can honestly look at and see that there was overwhelming evidence. There is a proper reason he abused these power because as the speaker, another statement, she said, that to do impeachment, you have to be so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, all of which we are not. So why not? Why are we here? Well, I think we can do this. Let’s look at the three things that typically are associated with making your case or a crime. Let’s do it against what the majority has said. And I think they have motive they have means and they have opportunity.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	What’s their motive? It’s November, 2020. It’s been said over and over and over again. The chairman said it again this morning. It’s been said all along that we have to do this because if we don’t impeach him, he’ll win again next year. The reason is shown is clearly as last week on the jobs report and the economy. And as I had a man come up to me in the grocery store this weekend, he said, keep doing what you’re doing. He said, I’ve never seen an economy this good. He said, “people are working, people are being taken care of.” And this is just a fatal distraction on a president that they don’t like. Motive as easy. November, 2016 they lost. January, 2017, just a few minutes in, the Washington Post confirmed what every Democrat had been talking about. Now’s the time for impeachment. We see tweet after tweet saying, now let’s get it. It’s amazing that they start with impeachment and then they spent two years trying to figure out what do we impeach him on?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Well, the means became what we see now. The means is to always talk about impeachment, to always say, this president is doing something wrong. To say he is illegitimate, as the chairman has said before, that he’s not even a legitimate president, is to constantly tear down at a president who is working on behalf of the American people. The sham impeachment. When we go through this, I think the chairman said something that was interesting. He said that the president should not be above the law and should be held accountable for the oath of their office. I think Congress ought to be held accountable for their oath of office as well and not to do what we’re doing right now, and that is run a process that doesn’t fit fairness or decorum, to run a process and a fact pattern that you’re having to force against a president you don’t like. But what was the opportunity?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The opportunity came last November, when they got the majority and they began their impeachment run. They began in the process, even as they’re selecting the chairman, the chairman said, “I would be the best person for impeachment.” This is November of last year. Before we had any hearings, before we had even more sworn in to this Congress for anyone, the media or watching on TV or watching in this room, for anyone to think that this was not a baked deal is not being honest with themselves. You see, presumption has now become the standard instead of proof. It should cause anyone to begin to question, because the entire case is built on a presumption. Or as we found out last week from three scholars, that inference is okay. If you just infer that that’s what they mean, then we’ll take that. That was an interesting line.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	You know, it’s interesting they made their whole case built on Gordon Sandlin. You’re going to see that a lot today. He testified that he presumed that the aid was connected to an investigation, but he said nobody ever told him that. When Sandlin even asked the president directly, he said, “what do you want?” The president said, “I want nothing.” I almost want Zielinski to do what he ran on, Ukraine, did nothing and got the aid anyway. But you know how I know that this is also a problematic experience. Just look over the past three weeks when the chairman of the intelligence committee, who by the way is absent today, I guess he can’t back up his own report, but he started his own hearing by making up the factual call. When he made it up, he started the fairy tale that we’re having today. If you can’t even put the transcript in the right context, just read it. Chairman Schiff couldn’t even read the transcript.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	He had to make it up because if he didn’t make it up, it didn’t sound as bad. It didn’t sound as bad. He said, let’s make up some dirt. That’s not what was said. The transcript. The chairman misled the American people as an attorney, as a chairman, as a member of Congress who swore an oath to tell the, basically to be honest with the American people and uphold the constitution. That was such a massive malpractice I’ve never seen, because you know why? Again, they don’t care about what actually was in the transcript. They don’t actually care what happened and we heard last week from witnesses, they don’t even care that the aid was released. They’re simply looking at the facts to make it fit their narrative. What else happened? You know, this is also the chairman Schiff who also said, that he had seen collusion in plain sight, that it was already there before the Mueller Report ever came out, that all of this was going to happen.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	"But you know, I guess maybe I might need to just not stop commenting on chairman Schiff and his guidance because I may end up on the next phone records subpoena, as we go forward. You see we’ve taken a dangerous turn in this Congress. Subpoenas are fine, properly done, and should be done properly. But they should never be at the expense of a political vendetta. Professor Turley testified last week; presumption is no substitute for proof. The current legal case for impeachment is not just woefully inadequate and in some respects dangerous and the basis for impeachment of an American president. Today what we were supposed to get was like a lot of my friends on the majority of this committee said, Mueller, when we got the Mueller Report, it didn’t go real well, so we had a lot of hearings. Didn’t go real well."
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Then we finally got Bob Mueller and they said, this is going to be the movie version. In fact, what happened, they did. My colleagues on the majority had a live readings from Capitol Hill. They made dramatic broadcasts. They even wrote a comic book rendition that breathed life into the Mueller report and it didn’t work. So they brought Bob Mueller. This was the movie version. They told us. Robert Mueller’s testimony would be the thing that people watched and would be convinced. Guess what? They wasn’t convinced. In fact, it fell flat. But you know today I guess is the movie version of the Schiff report, except one thing, the star witness failed to show up. Mr. Nunez is here, his staff is here. The leading headline is there, Schiff report? But where’s Mr Schiff? And Mueller, Robert Mueller testified. The Ken Starr report, Ken Starr testified. The author of the Schiff report is not here.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Instead he’s sending his staff to do his job for him. I guess that’s what you get when you’re making up impeachment as you go. So as we look forward here, there’s going to be plenty of time to discuss the factual case for this and the statements that are not being made. What is very detrimental to me though is this. This committee is hearing from a factual witness. This committee is not doing anything past hearing from law school professors and staff. The chairman said something about the president not being able to come. Show me where he would actually have a proper process in this that’s not talking to staff and not talking to law school professors, when we could actually have witnesses that will be called by both sides?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	But I want to say this, I love this institution. I was here as a 19 year old kid, as an intern, almost 32 years ago. This institution, as we see it today is in danger. We see chairman who are issuing subpoenas for personal vendettas. We see committees such as the judiciary committee that has held many, many substantive hearings, has been the very center point of impeachment, being used as a rubber stamp because we get not our marching orders from this committee and what it should be doing, but from the speaker and the intelligence committee chairman. We’re not able to do what we need to do because we’re a rubber stamp. I love this institution. But in the last three or four days, I’ve seen stuff that just bothered me to no end, and it should bother everyone. The speaker of the house after hearing one day of testimony and the judiciary committee said, “go write articles.” Facts be damned.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Al green, another member of the house majority said, “we can keep impeaching him over and over and over and over again.” Adam Schiff, when he told us he wasn’t going to come, instead hide behind his staff. He also told us that we’re going to keep investigating because they know this is going nowhere in the Senate, and they’re desperate to have a impeachment vote on this president. The economy’s good, job creation is up, military is strong, our country is safe and the judiciary committee has been relegated to this.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Why? Because they have the means, they have the motive, and they have the opportunity, and at the end of the day, all this is about, it’s about a clock and a calendar because they can’t get over the fact, Donald Trump is president of the United States and they don’t have a candidate that they think can beat him. It’s all political, and as we have talked about before, this is a show. Unfortunately today, the witness who was supposed to be the star witness, chose to take a pass and let a staff answer for him. With that, I yield back.  Democratic Counsel Barry Berke Opening Statement
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr. Chairman, you can ask or you can-
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I’m not. He can either ask or answer, he can’t do both. [inaudible 01:09:27] You can ask or answer, you can’t do both.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	You need to call balls and strikes the right way. You don’t interrupt either one of them, Mr. Chairman. You’re the questioner or the witness. Bang it harder. It still doesn’t make it to the point that you’re not doing it right.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Well, it’s become very evident why this hearing is here. And, while the craziness of this hearing, especially not having Mr. Schiff here, but, please put back up the last slide. I have no idea what number it is. Not as good a councilor as Harping. 53.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Did we cut it off after they got through?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Okay, well, while we’re doing this, I mean, I think it’s just the most amazing statement came out that we’re proofing the tweet that said that he thought that he was getting… the Democrats were concerned about impeachment. There’s nothing the Democrats have not been concerned about for two and a half years. Since August… since November, 2016. The president is saying nothing new in that tweet, that’s now back up.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	He’s known that they had been after impeachment. That’s why Mr. Goldman is here. That’s why Mr. Burke is here. That’s why we’re going through this charade of staff having to answer staff questions. And, basically, when we don’t like how it’s going, we start asking staff on staff and getting into a staff argument. Where’s Adam? Where’s Adam? It’s his report. His name. Mr. Goldman, you’re a great attorney, but you’re not Adam Schiff and you don’t wear a pin.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	We got a problem here. And, the problem that’s developing is this. You said you were an attorney. You’re a very good prosecutor. I believe it. I’ve read your bio. You’re a good attorney. You understand what quid pro quo is, correct?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	You understand what asking for something in exchange for something actually means, correct?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	You know about the conversation of Mr. Bidden when he asked, and he said, “I’m not going to give you the billion dollars.” You know about that conversation, correct?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Do you want me to read it to you or do you know it?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	No, I’m talking about the one from the national, where you did the… I’ll read it to you, since you were having trouble. As I remember going over to the Ukraine, convincing our team, our leaders, convincing them that we should provide for loan guarantees. I went over, I guess the 12th or 13th time to Kiev. I was supposed to announce that there was a billion dollar long guarantee. And, I’d gotten a commitment from Poroshenko, and they’re saying that I would take action against… that they would take action against the state prosecutor. They didn’t. So, they said they had, they were walking out to the press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to, or we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said… I said call him. Laughter. I said, I’m telling you, you’re getting… you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the being dollars I’m getting. I’m getting ready to be leaving here in, I think, about six hours. I looked at them and said, I’m leaving here in six hours. If the prosecutor’s not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Did he ask for something, request something, and hold something of value?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	George Kent testified this. I’m asking about not George Kent. I’m asking about this question.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	It’s not. Answer this question. Did he or did he not? Either Joe Biden’s a liar telling a story to make people impressed. Or, he actually did this. Which is it?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So, he did it in holding… withholding actual dollars… actual thing, holding this out there. So, Joe Biden, of everybody that we discussed, is the only one that’s done a quid pro quo. He’s the only one that’s used taxpayer dollars to actually threaten a foreign government. And, yet, we’re sitting here pretending that this is not happening? We’re sitting here pretending that a president of the United States now would not be concerned?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Look, you look at it this way, Joe Biden’s a terrible candidate. He can destroy himself on the campaign trail, but he can’t get by this. And, it doesn’t matter who brings it up. It doesn’t matter who does it. Because, this is what happened. And, you can why wash it all you want. You can go over whatever you want. But, that’s what he did. He’s either a liar, or he did it. And, he did it.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I want to continue on. Question is, a question that you had earlier. You rely on… approximately, how many times do you rely on Gordon Sondland’s testimony? In your report.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Would you be amazed if it was 600 times or better? I wouldn’t have any idea or not?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Okay. You did. It’s over 600 times. Would you also understand if you do a simple check of your report that over 158 times Mr. Sondland said not knowing something to the best of my knowledge or I don’t know. Would that surprise you?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The deposition and the closed door testimony.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Yes. It is. The question we’re having here though is Mr. Sondland also said, and many times he said he presumed what actually happened.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Let’s go back to something else. We’ll go and continue this in just a moment. According to your report, hipsy, and, we’ll classify that and, we’ll determine that to be the intelligence committee, and the other investigation with the other two committees, we okay with that?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Issued dozens of subpoenas. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Some of the subpoenas were not publicly reported until the hipsy issued its majority report, correct?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Answer the question. Mr. Burke had so much free reign, let’s go at it. Either answer the question or elaborate. One or the other.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Did you or didn’t you? Did it come out or not?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I’ll read it again. Some of the subpoenas were not publicly reported until the hipsy issued it’s majority report, correct?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Putting aside the witnesses who have publicly been identified, did you issue any other subpoenas for testimony other than the ones publicly identified?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Okay. Thank you.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	How many subpoenas were issued for records?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Moving on to other issues here. The Wall Street Journal reported that the committee issued at least four subpoenas to Verizon and AT&T for call records. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Are we wondering?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Absolutely. Wonderful. But, answer my question. For?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Was it at least four?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Thank you. Could have saved us a lot of time there. How many of these subpoenas were issued to AT&T?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Can you check your records? This is an important… because, we just found out about this over the weekend. We got a massive document dump over the weekend preparing for this hearing in which the chairman admitted, and, the staff admitted they’re not going to be able to read it all anyway. So, for all of you writing reports about this, all that massive document dump, we’re just simply going on a Schiff report. Which, Schiff refuses to come testify about, but sends his staff. So, this is important stuff. We just found out about this. So, how many subpoenas were issued to AT&T?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	That’s fine. If you don’t know, then, again, maybe your chairman could be here to actually answer this. Was it targeted at a single telephone number or numbers?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	How many?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Okay, let’s just stop here.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Oh, we’re getting to that. We’re getting to that.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	And, you’re not going to hear anything from me about a subpoena. And, the legality of a subpoena. My problem is this. Who on the committee asked that those numbers that you actually did put into for subpoena and get those numbers back. Who was it that asked that they be crosschecked for members of the media and members of Congress? Who ordered that?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	No. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. You came out with a report that actually showed these people, such as Mr. Chairman Nunez and others, were actually on these calls.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Now, someone… and, you and I, we’re not going to play cute here. Somebody took the four records that you asked for, the at least four. Took those numbers and then said, hey, let’s play match game. Who ordered the match game for members of Congress and the press? Was it you?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Then how did you get… okay, come on, that’s the most ridiculous item I’ve ever heard. You don’t just all of a sudden pick up numbers in which you have to match those numbers to actually show where they are and you don’t come up with them. Who ordered them to actually match for members of Congress and the press?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Who ordered to find out if Nuñez’ number was on those calls?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	At this point. That’s a wonderful explanation, but not an answer to my question. Those are you looking for the four numbers you asked for and to see how they’re connected. I understand the subpoena that you issued. My question directly, was it you or was it chairman Schiff that said, “While we’re doing this, let’s see if this matches chairman Nunez’ number. Let’s see if this matches a member of the press’ number.” Somebody along the way just didn’t all of a sudden having an epiphany, unless you’re getting ready to throw a low level staffer under the bus, that these numbers might match. So, who did it? Was it chairman Schiff or was it you. Be careful. You’re under oath.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Then answer the question.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The same second that was not afforded in my witness, by the way.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Who decided to leak it, by the way? If you’re not going to tell me the other story. While you’re thinking about how you’re going to answer that question, who decided to leak it? The information. Why did you include it in the report.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	How did you include it in the report? After not saying anything else about this, not publicly known. So, two questions are hanging out that everybody’s looking for an answer for, including me. Who ordered it? Was it you or was it chairman Schiff? And, then, why was it decided, except for nothing but smear purposes, to be included in the Schiff report?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Oh no, no, no. We’re not going to play that game.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	We’re not going to play that game. You’re as good as Mr. Burke. You’re not going to play that game. You’re not answering a question. And, every member of the media, everybody here, when you start going into the decorum of this house, when you start looking at members’ telephone numbers, you start looking in reporters telephone numbers, which, they ought to be scared about. You took a subpoena for four. And, then, you decided to play match game. You found numbers that you thought were… some of them actually didn’t exist. Because, they claimed that they were for the white house budget office, and, they were not. So, we’re throwing stories out there because nobody was-
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Nobody was out there action. So, I go back to my question. Are you going to go on record, in front of everybody here today, and say that you will not tell who ordered this? You, or, Mr. Gold… Mr. Goldwin, you, or, Mr. Schiff?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	And, that’s the problem we have with this entire thing. Mr. Schiff said behind closed doors the entire time.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I’m done with you for right now. We’re done. You’re not answering the question. You’re not being honest about this answer because you know who it is. You’re just not answering. Ms. Castor.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Let’s go.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr. Castor, can I ask you a question?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr. Castor, you’ve been a veteran of a hill investigation for 15 years. And, this is crazy. I’ve never seen anything like this. You never have either. Would it be interesting to note, because, Mr. Goldman chooses not to answer because he doesn’t want to incriminate, I believe, either himself or the chairman, or, somebody else. Would it be interesting to you to find, as you’ve dealt with committee staff for a long time, somebody to just have an epiphany, just to do those match records on their own? Or, were they under direction by somebody to do that?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	That’s it. All right. One last… I’m getting ready to try… wait. I have one thing for Mr. Goldman. Mr. Goldman, we’re used to committees and people and witnesses coming, taking gratuitous shots at people they don’t like. And, earlier today in your testimony, you made a comment that really goes… but, an interesting thing, and, I’ll even go back to the chairman questioning motive.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	When your testimony, you said, as you were discussing Mr. Sondland, you made a very snide comment, your actually… your facial expression showed that he was $1 million donor to the president. The implication being he either got his job because he bought it or his implication was he was loyal to the president and didn’t say anything about it. Be very careful about how you throw around dollars in giving. Because, you and Mr. Burke are real heavy donors to the Democratic Party. And, I’m not going to say it questions your motive or your position here today. But, we need to make sure that this thing is already blown out of proportion. We’re already not answering questions. And, you are here without a pin because your chairman will not testify. That says all we need to hear. He don’t even stand behind his own report and he sends you, I hope it works out for you.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I’m done at this point. I turned it over to Ashley.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I think you understand exactly what you did. And, I called it out for just the way you did. You thought you’re going to get by with it and you didn’t. That’s all I’m saying. Just ask Ms. Cowan.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I am done.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	As you did, Mr. Goldman.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	As you did to Mr. Sondland. Now, according to the chairman’s own ruling just a few minutes ago, I’m done asking questions and I’m not asking you to elaborate. Because, I’m not asking you any more questions. I’ve asked all… you won’t answer the question on who told the committee to actually check these numbers. You won’t say if it’s you or if it’s Mr. Schiff. You won’t answer my questions. So, we’re done. We’re going to Ms. Cowan. As Mr. Burke said, you’ll have plenty of time with healthful majority counsel [inaudible 01:54:59].
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Yes.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Thank you. Mr. Castor, we’ve heard a lot. It’s always a good time I think to go back and remind people that there are four things that really haven’t changed. Would you like to at least remind us of everything that’s been discussed?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Do you find it amazing that the majority’s one of their key prongs of this whole thing is that they’re making the elected leader of the Ukraine out to be a liar? Because if he says that there’s no pressure, he’s done it on many, many occasions since then. That underlie they believe him not to be truthful. So does that strike you is a little strange, especially in this circumstance.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	It is. It’s sad that we’re calling the elected leader who is actually working on corruption and other things like that. We’re calling him a liar simply because they don’t agree with the Democrats theory of a partisan impeachment, with that I yield back.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. One quick thing before we end. It does matter when they knew and didn’t know because after they supposedly found out, it does matter because after they had two meetings with officials from the United States, it was never talked about it and no linkage was made. So it does matter. And the reason it matters is because if there is no understanding that this is being withheld, there is no threat. There is no quid pro quo. And it also goes to the state of mind of Mr. Zelensky who says, “I’m not being pressured. I’m not being… “There’s nothing here. And again, it goes back to the amazing thought of this majority who keeps calling the Ukrainian leader a liar. It’s just amazing that we continue to propagate that myth here tonight.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	But what did we learn today? Here’s some things we did learn today. This unprecedented hearing the Mr. Sensenbrenner and others talked about in which staff, basically not members gave testimony and questioned each other and got into a very heated debates with each other. This is not what the Judiciary Committee should be doing, it is not the way they should be held. Again, the reason it is, Mr. Goldman handled himself very well, but he’s not Adam Schiff. He doesn’t wear a member pin. This is ridiculous. We shouldn’t be doing this.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The Intel Committee also, what we did find out today took phone records and went on a political endeavor against the ranking member and others, but no one will take responsibility for telling the staff to use Mr. Nunes’ numbers or this or who decided to put the smear job in the report. We’ll just assume that’s Mr. Schiff. Since I do hold a member accountable.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	We also found out today which was really interesting that staff can determine what’s relevant or not, not members of Congress. It’s interesting to me that staff told members of Congress that that wasn’t relevant or that wasn’t relevant. Again, it goes back to the problem, we all have have members here to actually talk about this.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Also, this is another thing we’ve learned today that the chairman continues to just disregard House rules. Just completely blatantly disregarding House rules on not addressing the minority hearing date. And if I hear basically one more time, I’ll address that when we’re marking up impeachment articles, what is the use of a minority hearing day, if you’re going to have evidence about the markup, if you get the confirmation at the markup itself? Even your most heated debate on getting rid of this president does not show any way that can be fair. And in the end, both parties are in the minority. If you destroy the institutional integrity, which again, the staff have talked about today. If we destroy the institutional integrity, there’s nothing else for us to do.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	But while we were here, there was something that did happen. And as we were sitting here discussing whether to impeach the president over a call he had with the Ukrainian president and President Zelensky, which took place on how… there was a look at how it happened in 2016. Democrats are seeking to impeach the president over that. And we’re seeing the problems with Russia investigation play out again in front of our eyes. The fuss over the Ukraine is the same thing using the same playbook. A select group of individuals colluding against President Trump to ensure they get him. And they are blowing through every procedure and principal of fairness and honesty to ensure they get him in time.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	So what happened today? While we were stuck here, the inspector general report, the review of four FISA applications and other aspects of the FBI Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Here’s some of the top findings. The FBI included inaccurate information in the Carter Page FISA application, the FBI failed to include exculpatory information in the FISA. The FBI did not cooperate a huge amount of the information in the Page FISA. The FBI chose to defensively brief candidate Clinton, not candidate Trump. The FBI failed to disclose Bruce Orr’s information that Steele reporting was going directly to the Clinton campaign. An FBI attorney altered another agency’s email to mislead about whether Carter Page had actually been a US intelligent source.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The bottom line, the report shows the Page FISA should have never been obtained. If you don’t have the Page FISA, you don’t have a Russia investigation. If you don’t have a Russia investigation, you can’t knock out the president as a candidate at the time of 2016 election and you can’t hamstring the president’s first two years with a special counsel investigation.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I could go on, but Mr. Durham who has already weighed in has the next batch of this and we will see where it goes. But I do want to take one last thing from our side because this undoubtedly will be the last hearing because we have no desire to hear anything from our side, minority hearing or otherwise. I want to take time to thank Mr. Castor and Ms. Callan. They’re the top investigators in the intelligence and judiciary committee and they combined to have 15 to 20 years experience in the House conducting investigations to protect American interests and taxpayer dollars.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	What these public servants don’t usually do as a part of their work is field questions from others who comes before them, from Democrats, donors and pundits, Nr. Castor and Ms. Callan usually work for and alongside members of Congress and fellow public servants. I’m sorry today the majority chose to highlight their investigators and also the ones that had been brought in over these public servants.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	I’m sorry to choose that this is where we’re at, but I would like to thank them for their work today. I’d like to thank them for their work on our behalf. But also I think really for all the ones listening here, if you look around the room, this is what’s happening to the American people. By the end of the day, most in the back left, most of the members of the media are begging to go somewhere else because at the end of the day, your case isn’t made. And one thing that just keeps amazingly said from Mr. Goldman, the Chairman, to others, these facts are undisputed.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	The very nature of the fact that I say I disagree and you say you don’t is a disputed fact. These are disputed facts. It’ll be the first impeachment that is partisan on facts that are not agreed to. That is the state in which the judiciary has become. We have become a rubber stamp just as the chairman predicted almost 20 years ago when we willingly accept from someone else a project or a report that we don’t investigate ourselves. And with that, that is the problem we have and that is the farce called the Judiciary Committee impeachment scam today. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Are you going to let him answer?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	Mr. Castor, you’ve been a veteran of a hill investigation for 15 years. And, this is crazy. I’ve never seen anything like this. You never have either. Would it be interesting to note, because, Mr. Goldman chooses not to answer because he doesn’t want to incriminate, I believe, either himself or the Chairman, or, somebody else. Would it be interesting to you to find, as you’ve dealt with committee staff for a long time, somebody to just have an epiphany, just to do those match records on their own? Or, were they under direction by somebody to do that?
2019-12-09	Doug Collins	R-Collins	Republican	That’s it. And I’m not going to say a question. Is your motive though, your position here today, but we need to make sure that this thing is already blown out of proportion. We’re already not answering questions, and you are here without a pin because your Chairman will not testify. That says all we need to hear. He don’t even stand behind his own report and he sends you. I hope it works out for you. I’m done at this point. I turn it over to Ashley.
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Before I turn to our witnesses, I just wanted to say to my democratic colleagues, not a single Republican member of this committee has said that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections. As the ranking member stated, we published a report focused on Russian active measures in 2016 with policy recommendations as to how we strengthen our cyber resiliency and election security to counter Russia. I myself have worked with members of this very committee on this issue but also on the House Armed Services Committee, so to have our democratic colleagues say these untruthful statements just reeks of political desperation in their continued obsession to manipulate mainstream media coverage.
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	But the good news is the American people understand that this has been a partisan process from the start, the democratic coordination with the whistleblower, the incessant and astounding leaks, the unprecedented closed-door process closed to the majority of members, closed to the press, closed to the people. Starting this inquiry without taking a vote. And then when finally forced to take a vote, the vote was with bipartisan opposition.
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Now, with four minutes left, I?m going to turn to our two witnesses. Thank you both for your service. Thank you, Dr. Hill, for your comments on the personal attacks. I wanted to ask you each fact-based questions. Dr. Hill, you testified that you handed over your duties on the NSC to Tim Morrison on July 15th and that you physically left the White House on July 19th. Correct?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	So that means that by the time there was the July 25th call with President Trump and President Zelensky, you are no longer on the NSC. Correct?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you were not on the call?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And it?s also correct that you did not participate in the preparation of talking points or the specific coordination of setting up the call?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And the first time you actually read the transcript of the call was when it was released to the public?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Mr. Holmes, I wanted to turn to you. Good to see you again. Thank you for mentioning the bipartisan delegation that I led on behalf of the House Armed Services Committee with my friend Representative Anthony Brown from Maryland. We did have an exceptionally informative visit where we highlighted the bipartisan congressional support for Ukraine, in particular the importance of countering Russian aggression. And we discussed in the briefings at the embassy the importance of defensive lethal aid in the form of Javelins, which I think you stated today, is quote, ?an important strategic deterrent to Russia.
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	I just want to highlight on the record, I know this has been asked, the Javelins were provided by the Trump administration and not the Obama administration. Correct?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Absolutely. All of our security assistance, which I strongly support. Again, thank you for being a host on that. Dr. Hill, turning back to you, there?s been discussion about the process of scheduling the meeting between President Zelensky and President Trump. And you testified that there was hesitancy to schedule this meeting until after the Ukrainian parliamentary elections. Is that correct?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And that?s because there was speculation in all analytical circles, both in Ukraine and outside the Ukraine, that Zelensky might not be able to get the majority that he needed to form a cabinet. Correct?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you also testified that another aspect of the NSC?s hesitancy to schedule this meeting was based on broader concerns related to Zelensky?s ability to implement anti-corruption reforms, and this was in specific relation to Ukrainian oligarchs who basically were the owner of the TV company that Mr. Zelensky?s program had been a part of. Is that correct?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Just distilling this down to the key facts, I wanted to ask both of you three key questions. The fact of the matter is Ukraine ultimately did receive the aid. Correct, Mr. Holmes?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Yes. And Dr. Hill?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And there was no investigation into the Bidens. Correct, Mr. Holmes?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Correct. And Dr. Hill?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And there was in fact a meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky ultimately at the U.N. Is that correct?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	The meeting at the U.N. President Trump and President Zelensky met at the U.N.
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	But they did have a meeting at the U.N.
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And Dr. Hill?
2019-11-21	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	They did? Okay, thank you. I yield back.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order under H-Res 660.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	The point of order is will the chairman continue to prohibit witnesses from answering Republican questions as you’ve done in closed hearings and as you did this week when you interrupted our questions?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order under H-Res 660.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	So we know clearly you’re going to interrupt us throughout this hearing.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Thank you. Mr. Nunes. Ambassador Yovanovitch, thank you for being here today.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	What is the interruption for this time? It is our time.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	The ranking member yielded time to another member of Congress.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	That is accurate. Ambassador Yovanovitch, I want to thank you for being here today.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	This is the fifth time you have interrupted members, duly elected members of Congress.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Thank you. Ambassador, before I was interrupted, I wanted to thank you for your 30 years of public service from Mogadishu to Ottawa, to Moscow, to London, to Kyiv. I also wanted to thank you for hosting the numerous bi-partisan delegations. I led one of those delegations in Ukraine. My questions today will focus on three key themes. The first is the role of the president when it comes to appointing our ambassadors. The second is longstanding corruption in Ukraine and the third is aid to Ukraine.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Earlier this week, as you know, we heard from George Kent and I know that Mr. Kent is a colleague, a friend, and someone who you deeply respect. In his testimony, he stated all ambassadors serve the pleasure of the president. You would agree with that statement, correct?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in fact, he elaborated and went on to emphasize that this is without question. Everybody understands that. You would agree with that?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in your own deposition under oath, you stated quote, “Although I understand, everyone understands that I serve at the pleasure of the president,” is that correct?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And just so there’s no public confusion, you are still an employee of the State Department, correct?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in the deposition, you say that you personally asked whether it would be possible to be a fellow at Georgetown University and, “That was arranged for me and I’m very grateful.” That’s where you’re posted today, correct?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Georgetown students are lucky to have you. We’re lucky to have you in foreign service, and I again want to thank you for your tremendous public service.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Shifting gears to corruption in Ukraine. In your powerful deposition, you described quote, “We have long understood that strong anti-corruption efforts must form an essential part of our policy in Ukraine and now there is a window of opportunity to do that. And so why is this important and why is this important to us? Put simply anti-corruption efforts serve Ukraine’s interest, but they also serve ours as well.” Is that still your testimony?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And particularly at the critical time in 2014, after the Ukrainian elections, you testified that the Ukrainian people had made clear in that very election that they were done with corruption, correct?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you also testified that the Ukrainians thought it would be a good idea to set up this architecture of a special investigative office that would be all about the crimes of corruption, correct?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And I know this was before you arrived in Ukraine, but you are aware that the first case that the US, UK, and Ukraine investigators worked on was in fact against the owner of Burisma?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And that was during the Obama administration?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in your testimony, and you said today, the investigation was never formally closed because quote, “It’s frankly useful to keep that company hanging on a hook. Right?” That’s your quote.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Partnered with the US and the UK?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	But let’s take a step back. The first time you personally became aware of Burisma was actually when you were being prepared by the Obama State Department for your Senate confirmation hearings. And this was in the form of practice questions and answers. This was your deposition and you testified that in this particular practice Q&A with the Obama State Department it wasn’t just generally about Burisma and corruption, it was specifically about Hunter Biden and Burisma. Is that correct?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And the exact quote from your testimony, Ambassador, is quote, “The way the question was phrased in this model Q&A was, ‘What can you tell us about Hunter Biden’s being named to the board of Burisma?'
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	So for the millions of Americans watching, President Obama’s own State Department was so concerned about potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping this wonderful ambassador nominee before her confirmation. And yet, our democratic colleagues and the chairman of this committee cry foul when we dare ask that same question that the Obama State Department was so concerned about. But we will continue asking it. And lastly, in my 20 seconds left, I just want to get it on record, in terms of defensive lethal aid, which you were an advocate for, that was not provided by President Obama. It was provided by President Trump?
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	I yield back five seconds.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Thank you. Since the Chairman has gaveled out all of my colleagues, with their unanimous consent I am going to read for the record many of the Chairman’s comments in September of the importance of hearing from the whistleblower. Again, Ambassador, thank you for your patience, thank you for your service, but since we haven’t been able to conduct ourselves in normal procedures, I’m just going to use the five minutes for this.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	September 29th in The Wall Street Journal, quote, “The whistleblower at the center of the impeachment investigation of President Trump will testify in the House very soon.” This is a quote by the Chairman.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	USA Today, September 29th. Talking with ABC news this week, Schiff, the Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee said the whistleblower would testify very soon and the only thing standing in the way was getting security clearances for the attorneys representing the whistleblower so they could attend the testimony.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	From Vox, September 29th. Rep. Adam Schiff said Sunday, “The whistleblower at the center of a growing scandal surrounding President Donald Trump will testify before the House Intelligence Committee very soon.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	On CNN, September 29th. Schiff said Sunday on ABC as well as NBC’s Meet the Press that he expects the whistleblower to testify very soon.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	The Washington Post, September 29th. In an appearance on ABC News this week, Schiff echoed Pelosi’s message. He also said he expected the Intelligence Committee to hear from the whistleblower very soon pending a security clearance from acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph McGuire.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	In the Huffington Post, Schiff told ABC’s This Week that he expects the whistleblower to appear before this committee very soon.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	In the New York Post, quote, “We’ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	In the Washington Times, quote, “That whistleblower will be allowed to come in.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	These are all quotes from Chairman Adam Schiff. In Talking Points Memo the question was posed … Actually, this was by George Stephanopoulos, “Have you reached an agreement yet with a whistleblower and his or her attorneys about coming before the committee and providing the information firsthand?” Quote, “Yes, we have,” Schiff responded. “And as DNI Maguire promised during the hearing, that whistleblower will be allowed to come in and come in without a minder from the Justice Department or from the White House to tell the whistleblower what they can and cannot say. We’ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	In Daily Kos, “We’re ready to hear from the whistleblower as soon as that is done and we’ll keep obviously riding shotgun to make sure that the acting director doesn’t delay in that clearance process.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	In CNBC, “We’ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	In MarketWatch, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday that an agreement has been reached under which the whistleblower will testify before the committee very soon.
0201-11-15	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	I can keep going, but again, the Chairman refused to allow us to put these into the record with unanimous consent so I’ve read those out. And as we know, it is important to protect whistleblowers from retaliation and from firing, and we want to make sure whistleblowers are able to come forward. But in this case, the fact that we are getting criticized by Chairman Adam Schiff for statements that he himself made early on in this process shows the duplicity and just the abuse of power that we are continuing to see. With a minute 54 seconds left, I’ll yield to my colleague Mr. Jordan.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Thank you, Ambassador Volker and Mr. Morrison, for your years of service and your professional expertise and leadership on national security issues. And I want to particularly thank Mr. Morrison for his great work on the House Armed Services Committee on which I serve.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	I wanted to start with a July 25th call between President Trump and President Zelensky. Mr. Morrison, you were on that call, and there was no mention of withholding aid on the call, correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And there was no quid pro quo, correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	No bribery?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	No extortion?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And Ambassador Volker, I presume you got a readout of the call. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	In this terse readout of the call, Ambassador, from the US participants, was there any reference to withholding aid?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Any reference to bribery?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Any reference to quid pro quo?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Any reference to extortion?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And I presume you also got feedback from your Ukrainian counterparts as to how the call went. Did they mention the withholding of aid?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Did they mention any quid pro quo?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And did they mention any bribery?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in fact, the day after the call, you met with President Zelensky. This would be on July 26th.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in that meeting, he made no mention of quid pro quo.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	He made no mention of withholding the aid.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	He made no mention of bribery.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	So the fact is, the Ukrainians were not even aware of this hold on aid. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in the coming weeks, you were in touch with Ukrainians as part of your official duties, and this included talking to Ukrainians over the phone, in person, on text. And the Ukrainians never brought up an investigation into the Bidens. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	They never brought up the withholding of the aid.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	They never brought up quid pro quo or bribery.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	I’m going to get to that, but until the Politico article, they did not bring it up.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you said in your closed-door deposition, quote, “It never came up in conversation with them, and I believe they had trust in me that they would have asked if that was really what they were worried about.” Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And as you pointed out, the Ukrainians never even knew their foreign aid was on pause until the article was published in Politico in August.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	So they didn’t know during the call.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in fact, you had to correct Chairman Schiff on this timeline in the closed-door deposition. The chairman of this committee asked you, quote, “When they became aware that military assistance was being withheld for a reason you couldn’t explain, no one could explain, weren’t they under even greater pressure to give the president what he asked for on the call?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you answered, Ambassador Volker, quote, “To my knowledge, the news about a hold on security assistance did not get into Ukrainian government circles as indicated to me by the current foreign minister, then diplomatic advisor, until the end of August.” Is that your testimony?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And Chairman Schiff also got the facts wrong again when he asked you this, quote, “At the point they learned their aid was paused, wouldn’t that give them added urgency to meet the president’s request on the Bidens?” And you answered, Ambassador Volker, quote, “I think the Ukrainians felt like they are going in the right direction, and they had not done anything. They had not done anything on an investigation,” end quote. Isn’t it the case, Ambassador Volker, at one point, Chairman Schiff said to you when you were truthfully testifying, quote, “Ambassador, you’re making this much more complicated than it has to be,” end quote. It’s page 127 from the deposition. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	But the truth is, the facts are indeed not complicated, and I’m going to close out with two questions for the both of you. Did Ukraine open investigation into the Bidens? Mr. Morrison.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Ambassador Volker.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Did either of you ever have any evidence of quid pro quo? Mr. Morrison.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Ambassador Volker.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Any evidence of bribery?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Any evidence of treason?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	With that, I yield back.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Ms. Williams, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, thank you for being here and thank you both for your service. As millions of Americans are watching throughout the hysteria and frenzied media coverage, two key facts have not changed that are critical to these impeachment proceedings. One, Ukraine in fact received the aid and two, there was no investigation into the Biden’s. My question to both of you today will focus on the following, systemic corruption in Ukraine. Two, highlighting for the public that by-law aid to Ukraine requires anti-corruption efforts.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And three, who in our government has the decision making authority when it comes to foreign policy and national security matters? So on corruption in Ukraine, as ambassador Yovanovitch testified, one of the key reasons why president Zelensky was overwhelmingly elected by the Ukrainian people, was that they were finally standing up to ramp and corruption in their country. Would you both agree with the ambassador’s assessment?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And Ms. Williams, corruption was such a critical issue from your perspective that when you prepared the vice president for his congratulatory call with presidents Zelensky, you testified that the points you wanted to communicate on the call where the following, quote, “Looked forward to seeing president Zelensky really implement the agenda on which he had run related to anti-corruption reforms.” That’s correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, would you agree that this focus on anti-corruption is a critical aspect of our policy towards Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you are aware that in 2014 during the Obama administration, the first anti-corruption investigation, partner between the U.S. The U.K. And Ukraine was into the owner of the company Burisma?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you testified that you were aware that Burisma had questionable business dealings, that’s part of its track record?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	You also testified that regarding Burisma, money laundering, tax evasion comports with your understanding of how business is done in Ukraine. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Well, that’s page 207 from your testimony, but I’ll move on. You are aware that Hunter Biden did sit on the board of the Burisma at this time?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Well, I know that my constituents in New York 21 have many concerns about the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of the vice president, sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burisma. The Obama administration state department was also concerned and yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden despite our requests. Every witness who has testified and has been asked this has answered, yes. Do you agree that Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And Ms. Williams?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Now shifting to the legal requirements that our aid to Ukraine is conditioned on anti-corruption. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you testify that you understood that Congress had passed under the Ukrainian security assistance initiative a legal obligation to certify that corruption is being addressed?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you also testify that it is required by the national defense authorization act?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	So for the public listening, we are not just talking about president Trump focusing on anti-corruption in Ukraine, but it is so critical, so important, that hard earned taxpayer dollars when given to foreign nations that by-law overwhelmingly bipartisan support requires anti-corruption in Ukraine in order to get U.S. tax payer funded aid. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you spoke extensively about the importance of defensive lethal aid to Ukraine specifically javelins. This was in your deposition?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you testified that the javelin in particular, because of its effectiveness in terms of influencing the Russian decision calculus for aggression, it is one of the most important tools we had have when it comes to providing defensive, lethal aid?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And it is a fact that that aid was provided under president Trump and not president Obama.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And my last question, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I know you serve at the NSC in the White House. I served in the West wing of the white house for president Bush on the domestic policy council and in the chief of staff’s office, so I’m very familiar with the policy process. I also know that as a staff member, the person who sets the policy of the the United States is the president, not the staff. And you testify that the president sets the policy, correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And I respect your deep expertise, your tremendous service to our country. We can never repay those that have worn the military uniform and served our nation. But I was struck when you testified in your deposition. I would say first of all, I’m the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable, I’m the authority for Ukraine, for the national security council and the White House. I just want a clarification. You report to Tim Morrison, correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Your direct report is Tim Morrison, correct?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And the chain of command is Tim Morrison to ambassador John Bolton, the national security advisor to the president of United States.
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And do you agree that the president sets the policy as commander in chief as you testified previously?
0201-11-19	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Thank you. My time’s expired.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Thank you. For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following. Number one, Ukraine received the aid. Number two, there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Mr. Kent and Ambassador Taylor, you both spoke eloquently and passionately about the need to support Ukraine to counter Russian aggression, particularly during this very critical time. I agree with you in that assessment. And isn’t it the case that the Trump administration has, indeed, provided substantial aid to Ukraine in the form of defensive lethal aid? Correct?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And that is more so than the Obama administration, correct?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Defensive lethal aid.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in the transcript of the President’s July 25th call with President Zelensky, President Zelensky tells Trump they are ready to buy more javelins. This is, indeed, the most effective weapon for fighting insurgent armor Russian tanks. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And those javelins were not made available to Ukraine under the Obama administration.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	The javelins were not made available-
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Correct. Shifting gears to corruption, one of the themes here today is that of rooting out corruption, which is an important tool for the president as we provide taxpayer-funded aid to foreign countries. Mr. Kent, you would characterize Ukraine as having longstanding corruption issues, correct?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in fact, you testified. “I would say that corruption is part of the reason why Ukrainians came out to the streets, in both 2004 when somebody tried to steal the election and again in 2014 because of a corrupt kleptocratic pro-Russian government which eventually collapsed. The Ukrainians decided enough was enough.” Is that your testimony?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you testified that you first came to learn about Burisma in 2015 when you were the senior anti-corruption coordinator, correct?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you testified that the issue of corruption in Burisma was in the US interest because, and this is from your deposition, “We had made a commitment to the Ukrainian government in 2014 to try to recover an estimated tens of billions of dollars of stolen assets out of the country.” Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	Sure. So the first case, this was … the first case that the US, the UK, and Ukraine investigator worked on was against the owner of Burisma.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And this was during the Obama administration.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	So for the millions of Americans viewing, the first investigation against the owner of Burisma was under President Obama’s administration.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	You testified also, “We spent roughly half a million dollars of State Department money in support of the FBI and this investigation, to build capacity and track down stolen assets.” Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And in fact, by 2016, you were so concerned about corruption questions related to Burisma that when there was an effort by Burisma to sponsor an essay contest with USAID, you asked USAID to stop it.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you testified that it was because “Burisma had a poor reputation in the business,” and that you didn’t think it was appropriate for the US government to be co-sponsoring something with a company that had a bad reputation. Correct?
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	You are also aware, and you testified today, that Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And you also testified that you were indeed concerned about the appearance of conflict of interest.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And broadly, this is very important, you testified in your deposition that when the State Department evaluates for an assistance, it is appropriate for them to look at levels of corruption in countries.
2019-11-13	Elise Stefanik	R-Stefanik	Republican	And lastly, you also testified that, and this is your quote, “Issues of corruption have been part of high-level dialogue between US leaders and Ukrainian leaders, regardless of who is the US leader and who is the Ukrainian leader. And that is a normal issue of diplomatic discussion at the highest level.” Is that correct?
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Holmes, why didn?t your boss talk about it?
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Why didn?t your boss bring up the call that you overheard? The reason you?re here today. I mean you?re their closing witness. Yet their star witness, their first witness, Ambassador Taylor didn?t even bring it up. And when we deposed you, you said this was extremely distinctive experience, one of the most remarkable events of my life. You described it like this. You said, ?after the call happens, I immediately told Deputy Chief of Mission and others at the embassy about the call.? Then you said, you went on vacation, you told several friends and family about the call. Then you come back on August six and you tell Ambassador Taylor about the call. And then in your deposition statement, you said in your statement today as well, ?I repeatedly refer to the call in meetings and conversations where the issue of the president?s interest in Ukraine was relevant. I repeatedly referred to the call in meetings and conversations where the issue of the president?s interest in Ukraine was relevant.? That sounds like government speak for you told everybody. Yet their star witness, their first witness Ambassador Taylor, when he came here, he related 13 different conversations he had between July 18th when the aid is frozen and September 11th when it?s released. 13 different conversations, never once mentioning this call. July 19th, Dr. Hill and Colonel Vindman told Taylor what Sondland told them. July 19th, Sondland told Taylor about the upcoming Trump/Zelensky call. July 20th, Sondland told Taylor what Sondland told Zelensky to tell Trump. July 20th, [inaudible 00:55:00] tells Taylor what Zelensky told [inaudible 00:22:01]. July 28th, Morrison tells Taylor what happened on the Trump/ Zelensky call. August 16th, Volker tells Taylor what Yarmack told Volker. August 21st, [inaudible 00:55:12] talks to Taylor.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	August 22nd, Morrison talks to Taylor. August 29th, Yarmack talks to Taylor. September 1st, Morrison tells Taylor what Sondland told Morrison about what Yarmack told Sondland. September 2nd, Morrison tells Taylor what [inaudible 00:55:23] told Morrison. September 7th, Morrison tells Taylor what Sondland told Trump. And September 8th, Sondland tells Taylor what Trump told Sondland. Nowhere, nowhere is there a Holmes tells Taylor what the president of the United States told Sondland. 13 conversations-
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Yeah, I?ll get to you, I?ll give you a chance here in a second.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But 13 conversations. 13 conversations from their star witness. You?re their closing witness and he can?t remember a call from a guy he works with every single day. Why?
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Maybe Mr. Holmes the takeaway was, he thought it was no big deal because he already knew. He didn?t remember it because we already had the transcript.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	He didn?t remember that? We had the Trump/Zelensky transcript had been out for two months.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Even though you?re repeatedly bringing this conversation up, as you said to everybody, anytime there?s a talk about Ukraine, you recall this conversation. Maybe it was the transcript? The call happened on the July 25th, that?s four months ago. The transcript?s been out for two months. Maybe the ambassador thought, this is nothing new here. But shazam, last week you come forward with supposedly this new information. There is nothing different in there than what we had on the transcript. Maybe that?s the reason their star witness, their first witness didn?t bring it up, but they had to have something. So you?re their closing witness because you overheard the president talking to Ambassador Sondland.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	That?s not what I asked. I asked why he didn?t share with us.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But he didn?t share it with us.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And-
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And so all of a sudden last week, you?ve got to come tell us, right?
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	That he doesn?t share the one that [crosstalk 00:59:56] the guy he works with, he doesn?t share that one?
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	There wasn?t an answer, it was a filibuster.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Hill, during your deposition, I asked you ?Was Christopher Steele?s dossier a rabbit hole?? Do you remember the answer you gave to that question?
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Yeah, and you also said, couple of pages later in the deposition or in the transcript that I have here of your deposition, that you thought he got played. Is that fair?
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I was struck by a number of things you said in your statement. Number of things I thought were right on the target. One was on page seven, you said this, ?President Putin and the Russian security services weaponize our own political opposition research.? And that is exactly what happened in 2016. Exactly what happened. You called it, you knew it, you saw it. The DNC hired Perkins Coie, who hired Fusion GPS, who hired Christopher Steele, who talked to Russians, who gave him a bunch of dirt, bunch of National Enquirer garbage that he compiled in a dossier, and our FBI used it. They used it as part of their investigation that they opened in July of 2016 where they spied on two American citizens associated with the presidential campaign. My guess is that?s probably never happened in American history. And exactly what Dr. Hill talked about is what happened in 2016. Exactly what she talked about.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And for 10 months, Jim Comey and his team did an investigation. And after 10 months they had nothing, because we deposed Mr. Comey, and he told us, ?After 10 months we didn?t have a thing.? But that didn?t matter. That didn?t matter. We got the Mueller investigation, $32 million, 19 lawyers, 40 FBI agents, 500 search warrants, 2,800 subpoenas. And they came back this spring, and what did they tell us? ?No collusion, no conspiracy, no coordination.? But the guys on the other side don?t care. They don?t care.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	They?re doing what? Dr. Hill said a number of important things in her opening statement. They?re doing exactly what Dr. Hill talked about. The impact of a successful 2016 Russian campaign remains evident today. Our nation is being torn apart. Torn apart. I?ve never seen it this divided and this is not healthy. It is not healthy for our culture, our country, not healthy for our nation. But that?s what these guys are doing. No conspiracy, no coordination, no, no collusion, but they don?t care.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Now this. This whole impeachment thing, as the witness said yesterday. The witness said yesterday, ?Without an announcement from Zelensky about an investigation, they weren?t going to get a call with the president, they weren?t going to get a meeting with the president, and they weren?t going to get aid from the United States.? But guess what? Ukraine, they got the call, they got the meeting, and they got the money, and there was never an announcement of any type of investigation.
2019-11-21	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But they don?t care. They?re going to move forward. There?s going to be some kind of report. They?re going to send some, I assume, something to the judiciary committee, and the process is going to go forward and there?ll be a trial in the Senate. All based on some anonymous whistleblower who came forward with no firsthand knowledge, who?s biased against the president, who worked with Joe Biden. Now all this. Now all this. This is? Dr. Hill?s right. She said it, we?ve got to stop this. But they?re not going to, and they?re doing it all 11 1/2 months before the next election. And I think maybe the most telling thing is what the speaker of the house said Sunday. Speaker of the house said, Sunday, this is scary. Speaker of the house said Sunday, national Sunday morning TV show, she said, ?The president is an impostor.? The guy that 63 million people voted for, who won the electoral college landslide. The Speaker of the House of Representatives called the President of the United States an impostor. Sad. It is sad what the country?s going through. I wish it would stop, but unfortunately I don?t think it is. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before speaker Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry 10 weeks ago on September 24th, before the call between president Trump and president Zelensky on July 25th, before the Mueller hearing in front of this committee on July 24th. Before all that, 16 of them had already voted to move forward on impeachment. 16 democrats on the judiciary committee had already voted to move forward on impeachment, yet today we’re talking about whether the positions they’ve already taken are constitutional? It seems a little backward to me. I mean, we can’t get agreement. I mean, we got four democrats, or four people who voted for Clinton and they can’t agree. Yet today we’re talking about the constitution.
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Now, professor Turley, you’ve been great today, but I think you were wrong on one thing. You said, “This is a fast impeachment.” I would argue it’s not a fast impeachment, it’s a predetermined impeachment. Predetermined impeachment done in the most unfair partisan fashion we have ever seen. No subpoena power for republicans, depositions done in secret in the bunker, in the basement of the Capitol. 17 people come in for those depositions. No one can be in there except a handful of folks that Adam Schiff allowed. In those depositions, chairman Schiff prevented witnesses from answering republican questions. Every democrat question got answered. Not every Republican question. Democrats denied republicans the witnesses we wanted in the open hearings that took place three weeks ago. And of course, democrats promised us the whistleblower would testify and then changed their mind, and they changed their mind why? Because the whole world discovered that Adam Schiffs staff had talked to the-
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Because the whole world discovered that Adam Schiff’s staff had talked to the whistle blower, coordinated with the whistleblower. Whistleblower with no firsthand knowledge, biased against the president, who worked with Joe Biden, whose lawyer, in January of ’17, said, “The impeachment process starts then.
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	That’s the unfair process we’ve been through, and the reason it’s been unfair… Let me just cut to the chase. The reason it’s been unfair is because the facts aren’t on their side. The facts are on the president’s side. Four key facts will not change, have not changed, will never change. We have the transcript. There was no quid pro quo in the transcript. The two guys on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky both said no pressure, no pushing, no quid pro quo. The Ukrainians’ third didn’t know that the aid was held up at the time of the phone call, and fourth, and most important, Ukrainians never started, never promised to start and never announced an investigation in the time that the aid was paused. Never once. But, you know what did happen in those 55 days that the aid was paused? There were five key meetings between President Zelensky and senior officials in our government. Five key meetings. We had the call on July 25th. The very next day, July 26, we had Ambassador Volker, Taylor, and Sondland meet with President Zelensky in Kiev. He then had Ambassador Bolton, end of August, meet with President Zelensky.
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	We then had the vice president meet with President Zelensky on September 1st, and we had two senators, Republican and, more importantly, Democrat Senator Murphy with Republican Senator Johnson meet with President Zelensky on September 5th. None of those five meetings, none of those five meetings was aid ever discussed in exchange for an announcement of an investigation into anybody, not one of them, and you would think the last two, after the Ukrainians did know the aid was being held, you would think you would come up then, particularly the one where you got Senator Murphy, the Democrat they’re talking about it.
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Never came up. The facts are on the President’s side, but we got an unfair process, because they don’t have the facts. We got an unfair process, most importantly… And this gets to something else you said, Mr. Turley. This is scary. How mad the…
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	That was so well said. This is scary. The Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people. To Mr. Turley’s point, 17 days ago, 17 days ago, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives called the president of the United States an impostor, the guy 63 million Americans voted for, who won an electoral college landslide, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives called that individual an imposter. That is not healthy for our country. This is not healthy. The facts are the facts. They are on the president’s side. That’s what we need to focus on, not some constitutional hearing at the end of the process when you guys have already determined where you’re going to go. With that, I yield back.
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I thank the gentleman for yelling. Professor Karlan, context is important, isn’t it?
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Yeah because just a few minutes ago when when our colleague from Florida presented a statement you made, you said, “Well you’ve got to take that statement in context,” but it seems to me you don’t want to extend the same or apply the same standard to the president because the now famous quote, “I would like you to do us a favor.” You said about an hour and a half ago that that didn’t mean us. It meant the president himself, but that’s the clear reading of this. “I would like you to do us a favor though because,” you know what the next two words are?
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I’ll tell you, “Because our country.” He didn’t say I would like you to do me a favor though because I have been through a lot. He said, “I want you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot.” You know when this call happened? Happened the day after Mueller was in front of this committee. Of course our country was put through two years of this and the idea that you’re now going to say, “Oh, this is the Royal we and he’s talking about himself,” ignores the entire context of his statement. That whole paragraph. You know what he ends in that paragraph with? Talking about Bob Mueller and this is the basis for this impeachment, this call. It couldn’t be further from the truth.
2019-12-04	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	You want the standard to apply when representative Gates makes one of your statements, “Oh, you’ve got to look at the context,” but when the President of the United States is clear, you try to change his word and when the context is clear, he’s talking about the two years that this country went through because of this Mueller report. Somehow that standard doesn’t apply to the president. That is ridiculous.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman, Mr. Castor. I want to go to the document that started it all, the August 12th whistleblower complaint. Bullet point one, on page one, of the whistleblower’s complaint, he says this, ” Over the past four months, more than half a dozen US officials have informed me the various facts related to this effort. Mr Castor, who are these half a dozen US officials?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	We don’t know, do we? And we had no chance to know for sure who these people were because we never got to talk to the whistleblower. Is that right, Mr. Castor?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	We needed to talk to the guy who started it all. We needed to talk to him to figure out who these more than half a dozen people were who formed the basis of this complaint. And we never got to. Adam Schiff’s staff got to. Adam Schiff knows who he is, but we don’t get to know and therefore we don’t get to know the original people, the six people, who formed the basis of this entire thing we’ve been going through now for three months. But we did talk to 17 people, right, Mr. Castor?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Seventeen depositions. And you were in every single one. You were the lawyer doing the work for the Republicans in every single one. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And there is one witness who they relied on and built their report around. One witness. Who would that witness? Because I read their report, it’s obviously one witness. Who’s that witness Mr. Castor?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Ambassador Sondland. I think you said earlier, his name was mentioned, I don’t know, six? What’d you say?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	611 times. More than Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, the guy who was on the call. More than Ambassador Taylor, their first witness, their star witness, the very first hearing in the intelligence committee, they relied on Sondland, not the whistleblower, not the more than half a dozen people who informed the whistleblower. They relied on Ambassador Sondland. And why’d they pick Sondland, Mr, Castor?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Because that’s the best they got? The guy who had to file an addendum to his testimony? The guy that had to file the clarification? The guy who said, two weeks ago, sitting in the same chair you’re sitting in Mr. Castor, in his 23 page opening statement, he said this, “Unless President Zelensky announces an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens, there would be no call with President Trump. There’d be no meeting with President Trump. There’d be no security assistance money going to Ukraine. That’s what Ambassador Sondland said. Mr. Castor, was there an announcement by President Zelensky about investigating the Bidens or Burisma?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	No announcement?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Did President Zelensky get a call from President Trump?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Did President Zelensky get a meeting with President Trump?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Did President Zelensky get the money from the United States?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	They got the call on July 25th. They got the money on September 11th. They got the meeting on September 25th, is that right?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But the guy who said no that was going to happen is the guy they build their case around?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Is that right, Mr. Sondland?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Let me go to one other thing they built their case around, they built their case around a lot of hearsay, didn’t they?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And the best example, the hearsay, surprisingly enough is Ambassador Sondland. It’s amazing, they built a case around this ambassador, and they built a case around hearsay. And the best example of both is Mr. Sondland, Ambassador Sondland, because he filed his addendum, his clarification, where he says this. We read this a couple of weeks ago. We pointed this out a couple of weeks ago. He says this in bullet point number two, in his clarification, he says, “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak, on a September 1st, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw, and a meeting with President Zelensky.” That’s his clarification.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Amazing, six people, as I said before, having four conversations in one sentence. “Ambassador Taylor recalls the Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1st, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence’s visits to Warsaw, and a meeting with President Zelensky.” That’s the clarification. That’s their star witness who they built their case around. So- and-so tell so-and-so what somebody said to someone else and there you have it, that’s their case. They forget the four key facts. They forget the fact that we have the call transcript and there was no quid pro quo. They forget the fact that two guys on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, have said repeatedly there was no pressure, no linkage, no pushing. They forget the fact Ukraine didn’t even know aid was held at the time of the call. And they forget the fact, most important, they did nothing to get the aid released. No announcement of any type of investigation whatsoever. They forget all that, those key facts. And they build their case around the guy who had to clarify his testimony with that amazing sentence. Mr. Goldman, did the Democrats publish phone records of the President’s attorney?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Did the Democrats publish phone records of a number of the press?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Did the Democrats publish phone records of a member of Congress?
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Did the Democrats, is that member of Congress also happens to be your bosses political opponent, that those phone records were published up. So the Democrats, they run this kind of investigation, ignoring the facts, not letting the whistleblower come in, and therefore not letting us know if we’ve talked to the more than half a dozen original sources for the whistleblower’s complaint in the first place. The guy has to file an addendum with that clarification sentence.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But one thing they did do in their report is they published the phone records of the President’s personal lawyer, the phone records of a member of the press, and the phone records of the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee’s political opponent, Representative Nunes. That’s what these guys did, and that’s their effort to impeach the President of the United States, 11 months before an election.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. The majority’s witness was wrong when he said that we were able to subpoena people and get our witness here.
2019-12-09	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	We were not. So I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the two letters sent to Chairman Nadler and the other one to-
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I have a point of order though.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I have a point of order.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Chairman, there are four transcripts-
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	That have not been released.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Holy cow.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I want you to release the four transcripts of depositions-
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	That’s my point of order.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Geez.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I have a unanimous consent request that an article entitled Whistleblower is Expected to Testify Soon, House Intelligent Chairman Schiff Says, Wall Street Journal, September 29, 2019, be included in the record
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I have a unanimous consent request that an article entitled Whistleblower Reaches Agreement to Testify, Will Appear Very Soon, Representative Adam Schiff Says, USA Today, September 29, 2019.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I have a unanimous consent request. Article entitled Shift Confirms Tentative Agreement for Whistleblower to Testify Before House Intelligence Committee, CNN, September 29, 2019.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I have a unanimous consent request. Intelligence Panel Has Deal to Hear Whistleblower’s Testimony, Says Schiff, Washington Post, September 29, 2019.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I have a unanimous consent request. An article entitled Whistleblower Reportedly Agrees to Testify Before House Intelligence Committee Reported by Schiff, Huffington Post, September 29, 2019
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I have a unanimous consent request. An article entitled Schiff: Panel Will Hear from Whistleblower, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, September 29t, 2019.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I would also add that the Chairman has promised we’ll get to see the transcripts. But there’s still four people we’ve deposed that we have not been able to see their transcripts, have their transcripts released, and therefore the testimony they provided, we’re not able to use in these open hearings. If it’s an open hearing, all the available testimony from depositions that has been taken by the committee should be available to be discussed for the American people to see. But no, no, no, Mr. Morris and Mr. Hale and Miss Williams, two others and another one have not yet been released. So, I hope the Chairman releases that.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	One of the point I would make in the last minute of Miss Stefanik’s time, the Democrats have asserted that this whole thing with Ambassador Yovanovitch was part of some sinister scheme by the White House to get President Zelensky to do an investigation. If for calling Ambassador Yovanovitch was part of some scheme by Trump and Pompeo and Giuliani to get President Zelensky to do an investigation, why would they replace her with the Democrat’s first witness, their star witness Bill Taylor?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I mean, if that’s the plan, not the best plan I’ve ever seen put together. Their star witness, their first witness, Mr. Taylor was here Wednesday. That’s what they were up to? I think that just demonstrates that that is not what went on here. Mr. Zelensky never undertook any investigations, and the reason the aid was released as we discussed on Wednesday was because Vice President Pence, Ambassador Bolton and US Senators all talked with President Zelensky and they were convinced he was the real deal as the Ambassador has alluded to in her testimony. That’s why the money was released. With that, I yield back.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Ambassador, thank you for being here. Thank you for your service to our country. Ambassador, should ambassadors ever try to influence host-country elections?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I think you said in your opening statement, “Partisanship of this type is not compatible with the role of a career foreign service officer.” Is that right?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But that’s exactly what happened in 2016. In August of 2016, the very month you went to Ukraine as our Ambassador, the Ukrainian ambassador here in the United States, Ambassador Chaly, wrote an op-ed in The Hill, said this, “Trump’s comments send wrong message.” So the very month you’re over there as our ambassador, Ukraine Ambassador Chaly writes that op-ed.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And it wasn’t just that attack, as Mr. Castor got into earlier. It wasn’t just that attack on the President. We had former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk who criticized Candidate Trump. We had Mr. Avakov. I believe earlier you said, Ambassador, that Mr. Avakov was the individual who first alerted you to the efforts of Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Avakov, back during this same time period in the months just prior to the 2016 election, called then-Candidate Trump all kinds of names, called him a terrorist.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	"And of course we have Mr. Leshchenko, a member of Parliament who was a source for Fusion GPS in the now somewhat-famous dossier that flowed from Fusion’s work; he said this in the Financial Times, again in August of 2016 when you first arrive in Ukraine, he said this: “The majority of Ukrainians, the majority of Ukrainian politicians, are on Hillary Clinton’s side."
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	So you had several high-ranking officials in the Ukrainian government, when President Poroshenko is President of Ukraine, criticize President Trump, then-Candidate Trump, all in the late summer and fall of 2016. What I want to know, Ambassador, when this was all happening, did you go talk to anyone in Ukrainian government about this?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Did you go say to some of these officials, “Hey you guys, you guys need to knock this off. This perception that we’ve got,” as Mr. Leshchenko said, “the majority of Ukrainian politicians on Hillary Clinton’s side. That’s not good.” Did you have that conversation?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Didn’t talk to anyone in the government? Did you talk to President Poroshenko?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Didn’t alert anyone in the government?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Well one of the things we’ve heard so much over the last six weeks in depositions, and frankly in the hearing on Wednesday, is how important bipartisan support is for Ukraine. Democrats and Republicans agree that we want to help Ukraine.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	In fact, the Democrats’ first witness, their star witness on Wednesday, Mr. Taylor, said, “Ukraine’s most important strategic asset is this bipartisan support.” And you would agree with that, right?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	He said this in his testimony on Wednesday: “On September 11th, I learned that the hold had been lifted the next day.” Ambassador Taylor said, “I conveyed this news to President Zelensky and the Ukrainian Foreign Minister. And I reminded Mr. Yarmak of the high strategic value of bipartisan support for Ukraine and the importance of not getting involved in other countries’ elections.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	"So what I’m wondering is: This is the day after the aid’s been lifted that Ambassador Taylor made this statement to the Ukrainian government; and he makes this after there’s nothing been done by Ukraine to influence our election… because President Zelensky didn’t announce he was doing an investigation, and the aid was lifted… but he felt he needed to say that."
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But in 2016, when we know that the majority of Ukrainian politicians want Clinton to win because it was said by a member of Parliament when the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine writes an op-ed criticizing then-Candidate Trump, when Mr. Avakov calls Candidate Trump all kinds of names, nobody goes and talks to him and tells him to knock it off.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Did you have any conversations, Ambassador, with Victoria Nuland or Secretary of State Kerry about what was going on in 2016 and this majority of Ukrainian politicians being for Candidate Clinton and opposed to President Trump?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	No one did anything. No one did anything. Do you see why maybe the president was a little concerned about what went on in Ukraine? And you couple that with the corruption level that we know exists in Ukraine, you add to that this idea that he’s not a big fan of foreign aid, why he might be a little concerned about sending the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people to Ukraine?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	There was.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I’m asking-
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m asking… Maybe we can kind of see why the President was a little concerned, when you have the highest-ranking officials in the government, the ambassador, criticizing him; Parliamentary Member Leshchenko criticizing him; when you have Avakov, the guy who first told you about Giuliani, criticizing…"
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	All this going on, and when you couple that with the concerns he has about corruption, the concerns he has about Europe not doing enough, the concerns he has about reluctance to send in the hard-earned tax dollars to any country-
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I appreciate it.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I appreciate it.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Our indulgence wore out with you a long time ago, Mr. Chairman. I’ll tell you that.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I’m asking her: Do you think there’s maybe a reason that President Trump’s concern was justified?
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I didn’t say that.
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Would you ever write an op-ed-
0201-11-15	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	… critical of a presidential candidate in Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I thank gentleman. Ambassador Volker, you were the Special Representative to Ukraine, is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And prior to that, in your diplomatic service, you worked at the NSC, you were a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, you were Ambassador to NATO, Senate confirmed Ambassador to NATO in your distinguished diplomatic career. So it may not bother you when you’re referred to as the irregular channel, but it bothers representative Turner, it bothers me. You were the special envoy to Ukraine. And in that role you said in your opening statement, you were the administration’s most outspoken public figure highlighting Russia’s invasion and occupation of Ukraine and calling out Russia’s responsibility in the war. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And in that capacity, you strongly advocated for lifting the ban on sale of lethal defensive arms to Ukraine. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And President Trump did it, didn’t he?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But in spite of that, President Trump was still skeptical of giving hard earned tax dollars to Ukraine, right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	That’s one reason. And then Ukraine’s history of corruption is another.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	One of the third most corrupt countries on the planet, and Europe isn’t doing enough, and oh, by the way, in the president’s mind, he did think Ukraine was trying to influence the 2016 election, because things happened. The Democrats want to deny it, but when the ambassador from Ukraine here to the United States writes an op ed on August 4th, 2016 criticizing then candidate Trump, that’s certainly trying to influence the election. When Mr. [inaudible 00:53:15], a key minister in their government says all kinds of negative things about candidate Trump, that certainly looks like it’s trying to influence the election and when Mr. Leschenko states in the Financial Times during the campaign, the majority of Ukrainian political figures want Hillary Clinton to win, that probably sticks in a candidates mind. I know we all run campaigns, and when people say bad things about us in the course of the campaign, we don’t necessarily think great things about them. But you were convinced Zelensky was the real deal, right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Because you spent a lot time with the guy. And guess what? When aid was frozen, you knew if you could get these two guys together, it would work out. When aid was frozen, what did you say? You told the Ukrainians don’t worry about it. Well you didn’t say it. You said don’t be alarmed.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And guess what happened, when aids frozen, and when it’s released, all kinds of interactions between President Zelensky and senior US officials. Right? Starts with a call. Starts with a call with President Trump and President Zelensky. Next day, you meet with President Zelensky in Ukraine. Then we have Ambassador Bolton meeting with him, then we have Vice President Pence meeting with him. Then we have US Senators Johnson and Murphy meeting with him. And guess what? In none of those meetings, not a single one, did security assistance dollars in exchange for an investigation, not once did they come up, did that conversation come up, is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Not once. No discussion of aid for investigations, and as you testified, you never believed aid for investigations was ever being talked about either, in any of these conversations.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But what happened in those meetings? They all became convinced of the same thing you knew. They all saw the same darn thing. This guy was the real deal. He is a legitimate reformer, and they all came back. They all came back and told the president, Hey, Mr. President, this guy’s real. Go ahead and release the dollars. Oh, by the way, in that same timeframe, you know what else happened? Their parliament, their newly elected parliament, as Mr. Morrison testified to, stayed up all night to pass the reform measures, to get rid of the prosecutor, to put in the Supreme High Anti-Corruption Court, to get rid of this ability that no one in their Congress, in their parliament could ever be hit with a crime, I mean that’s Unbelievable. All that happens, and they come back and tell President Trump, hey, guess what, time to release the dollars. And he did it, right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Yeah, you did your job. You did your job, and you got to put up with all this because the Democrats are out to get this president. You did your job, just the way Mr. Turner described, you did your job over all these years. All these years, and the Democrats put you through this. You have served our country well the kind of diplomat we want serving. And here’s one of the saddest things about all this, what the Democrats are putting us through, you two guys who are here telling it straight, you’ve both decided you’re going to step out of government, because of what these guys are doing, and that’s the sad thing. People like ambassador Volker and Tim Morrison who have served our country so well are now stepping out of our government, because of what these guys are doing. And that’s why Mr. Turner got so fired up a few minutes ago, and why I’m so fired up to, because we appreciate what you guys did. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Volker in the now famous call transcript, the bottom of page three president Trump said this, “I heard you had a prosecutor and he was shut down and that’s really unfair”. Just for clarification, do you believe President Trump was talking about Lutsenko or Shoken?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Shoken, all right, thank you so much. That’s what I thought as well. Mr. Morrison, you testified in your deposition that you had issues with Colonel Vindman’s judgment. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And you said specifically that you had concerns with Colonel Vindman exercising, “appropriate judgment as to whom he said what”, is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	You testified that Dr. Hill, your predecessor at NSC told you that she had concerns about Colonel Vindman’s judgment. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And you testified that Colonel Vindman did not always adhere to the chain of command, is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	You testified that you were aware of issues with Colonel Vindman trying to access information outside his lane. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Okay, thank you. You testify that Colonel Vindman was not included on certain trips, is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And you testified that colleagues express concerns to you about Colonel Vindman leaking information. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Now when I asked Colonel Vindman why he didn’t go to you with his concerns about the call, even though you, his boss, had no concerns about anything being, I think your language was nothing improper, nothing illegal on the call. I asked Colonel Vindman earlier this morning why he didn’t go to you and instead went and talked to the lawyers, his brother, Secretary Kent, and one other person that he wouldn’t tell us and Chairman Schiff wouldn’t allow him to tell us. When I asked him why he did that, he indicated that the lawyers had instructed him to do that and he tried to get ahold of you. Is that fair?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Okay. Well, one thing that Chairman Schiff brought up at the end of this morning’s hearing, he said, he pointed out that you, Colonel Vindman’s boss, also went to the lawyers, but your reason for going to the lawyers was a little different, wasn’t it?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Yeah. I think you had a few things that Mr. Caster and you talked about earlier in today’s hearing, but I think at the top of your list was you were concerned about the contents of the call leaking out. Is that fair?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And that’s exactly what happened, isn’t it?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Well, it seems to me you were prophetic, Mr. Morrison, because you said in your statement today, “as I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how the disclosure of the contents of the call would play in Washington’s political climate. My fears have been realized”. It seems to me you saw what might happen and it sure enough did, fair to say?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And we get all this and that’s the part that gets me, we get all this, these hearings, these weeks, basement and the bunker in the basement of the Capitol and four facts that we keep coming back to have never changed. Will never change. We’ve heard from both of you today. I confirmed these fundamental facts.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	We’ve got the call transcript as you’ve both said, no linkage to security assistance dollars and investigations in the call transcript. We’ve got the two individuals who were on the call, they’ve both said no linkage, no pressure, no pushing. We’ve got the fact that the Ukrainians didn’t even know aid had been withheld until August 29th and most importantly the Ukrainians did nothing as far as starting, promising to start, announcing they were going to start investigation, did nothing and the aid got released. And I believe it got released because of what we’ve been talking about. The good work of Ambassador Volker and others. I believe that’s why it happened and yet here we are. And you called it all. You saw this coming, that’s why you went to the lawyers. That’s why the concern was there and that’s the part that’s most troubling. I yield back Mr. Chairman. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sunday, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives called the President of the United States and impostor. Speaker of the House called the President an imposter. The guy 63 million people voted for, the guy who won an electoral college landslide, the speaker calls an impostor. That’s what’s happened to our country, to this Congress. The speaker’s statement says it all, the Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people, Democrats don’t trust the American people. The American people who wanted to send someone to this town who was willing to shake it up a bit, they don’t trust that and they have tried to do everything they can to undo what the American people decided on November 8th, 2016.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	They’ve been out to get the President since the day he was elected. The whistle blowers lawyer, the whistle blowers legal team said this January 30th, 2017, President had been in office about a week, “Coup has started, first of many steps.” Next sentence, “Impeachment will follow ultimately.” I guess we’re in the final step started three and a half years ago. Congressman Tlaib started this Congress, first day of Congress said, “Impeach the President.” Representative Green said, “If we don’t impeach him, the President’s going to win reelection. We got to do it.” Most importantly, five Democrat members of this committee voted to move forward with impeachment before the phone call ever happened.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	The truth is the attacks actually started before the inauguration, even before the election. A ranking member talked about this. His opening statement July 2016, “FBI opens an investigation so-called Trump, Russia Coordination Collusion,” which was never there. Opened an investigation, spied on two American citizens associated with the Presidential campaign. My guess is that’s probably never happened in American history, but they did it. And for 10 months, Jim Comey’s FBI investigated the President. Guess what? After 10 months they had nothing and you know why we know that? Because when we deposed Mr. Comey last Congress, he told us they didn’t have a thing. No matter, Special Counsel Mueller gets appointed and they do a two year, $40 million, 19 lawyer unbelievable investigation and guess what? They come back and they got nothing, but the Democrats don’t care.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	So now we get this, a bunch of depositions in the bunker, in the basement of the Capitol, witnesses who aren’t allowed to answer questions about who they talked to about the phone call. We get this all based on some anonymous whistleblower, no firsthand knowledge, bias against the president. These facts have never changed, we learned these right away. Who worked with Vice President Biden, who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, but waited 18 days to file a complaint. 18 days to file a complaint, what did he do in those 18 days? We all know, ran off and talk with Chairman Schiff’s staff and then hired the legal team that I just talked about. One of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	This is scary what these guys are putting our country through. It is sad, it is scary, it is wrong. And the good news is the American people see through it all. They know the facts are on the President’s side as Representative Stefanik said, “Four facts will never change.” We got the transcript, which they never thought the President would release, shows no coordination, no conditionality, no linkage. We got the two guys on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, who have said nothing wrong, no pressure, no pushing here. We got the fact that Ukrainians didn’t even know aid was held up at the time of the call, and most importantly, we have yet to have one witness tell us that any evidence from anyone that that President Zelensky did anything on investigations to get the aid released.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Those facts will never change. The facts are on the President’s side, the process is certainly not. It has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the American people understand that those 63 million Americans, they understand it. And frankly, I think a lot of others do as well. They see this for what it is and they know this is wrong. Especially wrong just 11 months before the next election. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I thank the ranking member. Colonel, I want to thank you for your service and sacrifice to our great country. This afternoon, your former boss, Mr. Morrison, is going to be sitting right where you’re sitting and he’s going to testify. And I want to give you a chance, I think we’re bringing you a copy, I want to give you a chance to respond to some of the things Mr. Morrison said in his deposition, page 82 of the transcript from Mr. Morrison.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Morrison said this: “I had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s judgment. Among the discussions I had with Dr. Hill in the transition with our team, its strength, its weaknesses, and Fiona and others had raised concerns about Alex’s judgment.” When Mr. Morrison was asked by Mr. Castor, “Did anyone ever bring concerns to you that they believe Colonel Vindman may have leaked something,” Mr. Morrison replied, “Yes.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	So your boss had concerns about your judgment. Your former boss, Dr. Hill, had concerns about your judgment. Your colleagues had concerns about your judgment. And your colleagues felt that there were times when you leaked information. Any idea why they have those impressions, Colonel Vindman?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	So it was-
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Okay, I’m sorry.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And Colonel, you never leaked information?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Okay. Colonel, it’s interesting, we deposed a lot of people in the bunker, in the basement of the Capitol, over the last several weeks, but of all those depositions, only three of the individuals we deposed were actually on the now-somewhat-famous July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. There was you, the individual sitting beside you, Ms. Williams, and then there, of course, was your boss, Mr. Morrison, who I just read from his deposition.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	When we asked Ms. Williams who she spoke to after the call, about the call, she was willing to answer our questions and Chairman Schiff allowed her to answer our questions. When we asked Mr. Morrison who he spoke to after the call, about the call, he was willing to answer our question and Chairman Schiff allowed him to answer our question. But when we asked you, you first told us three individuals at the NSC, your brother and the two lawyers. And then you said there was a group of other people you communicated with, but you would only give us one individual in that group, Secretary Kent. And the Chairman would only allow you to give us that name. When we asked you who else you communicated with, you would not tell us. So I want to know first, how many other people are in that group of people you communicated with outside the four individuals I just named?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Two individuals.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Chairman, can you first stop the time so I don’t lose the time?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I don’t see how this is outing the whistleblower. The witness has testified in his deposition that he doesn’t know who the whistleblower is. You have said, even though no one believes you, you have said you don’t know who the whistleblower is. So how is this outing the whistleblower to find out who this individual is?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And I’d like to-
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Well, okay. Colonel Vindman, there’s another thing Mr. Morrison told us in his deposition, he said he was not concerned about the call itself. He said there was nothing illegal or improper on the call. But he was concerned about the call leaking, the contents of the call leaking. He said this, he was concerned how it would play out in Washington’s polarized environment, how the contents would be used in Washington’s political process.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Morrison was right.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Page 44.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Morrison was right. The call leaks, the whistleblower goes to Chairman Schiff’s staff, then he runs off to the lawyer, the same lawyer who said in January of 2017, “The coup has started against President Trump.” The one thing the Democrats didn’t, the one thing they didn’t count on, one thing they didn’t count on was the president releasing the call transcript and letting us all see what he said. They didn’t count on that. The transcript shows no linkage. The two individuals on the call have both said no pressure, no pushing, no linkage, [inaudible 00:06:41] security assistance dollars to an investigation.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Ms. Williams, after the call on the 25th, we know that Colonel Vindman talked to several people, after the call on the 25th, how many people did you talk to about the call?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Didn’t speak to anybody?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I yield back.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I thank the gentleman for yielding. Colonel Vindman, why didn’t you go, after the call, why didn’t you go to Mr. Morrison?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	So the lawyer, you not only didn’t go to your boss, you said you tried, but you didn’t go to your boss, you went straight to the lawyer and the lawyer told you not to go to your boss?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I’m going to read from the transcript here. “Why didn’t you go to your direct report?” Mr. Morrison. Your response was, this is page 102, “Because Mr. Eisenberg had told me to take my concerns to him.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	“And I ask you, did Mr. Eisenberg tell you not to report, to go around Mr. Morrison?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And you said, “Actually, he did say that I shouldn’t talk to any other people.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Enough time to go to talk to someone that you won’t tell us who it is, right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Well, here’s what I’m getting. The lawyer told you, “Don’t talk to any other people,” and you interpret that as not talking to your boss, but you talk to your brother, you talk to the lawyers, you talk to Secretary Kent, and you talk to the one guy Adam Schiff won’t let you tell us who he is. Is that right?
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I’m not saying you didn’t. All I’m saying is the instructions from the lawyer was, “You shouldn’t talk to anybody,” and you interpret that as, “Don’t talk to my boss, but I’m going to go talk to someone,” that we can’t even ask you who that individual is.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Well, I just read what you said.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	“I shouldn’t talk to any other people.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I’m reading from your transcript, Colonel Vindman.
0201-11-19	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Oh, so that’s when it happened. That’s when you talked with someone.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	-aids held up on July 18th, is that right?
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Then it’s then it’s released, Ambassador Taylor on September 11th, and we know that from your deposition, in those 55 days that aid is delayed you met with president Zelensky three times. The first one was July 26th, the day after the famous call now between president Trump and President Zelensky. President Zelensky meets with you, Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sondland and again according to your deposition and your testimony, there was no linkage of security assistance dollars to investigating Burisma or the Biden’s. Second meeting’s August 27th. Again in this 55 day timeframe. Second meeting is August 27th, President Zelensky meets with you and Ambassador Bolton and others and again, there’s no linkage of dollars, security assistant dollars to an investigation of the Bidens.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Then of course the third meeting is September 5th. President Zelensky meets with you and Senators Johnson and Murphy, and once again there is no linkage of security assistance dollars to an investigation of Burisma or the Bidens. Three meetings with the president of Ukraine, the new president and no linkage. That’s accurate.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	The Politico article.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	No linkage.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Three meetings face to face with President Zelensky no linkage. Yet in your deposition, you said this and you said it again the first hour of the majority. “My clear understanding was security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the investigation. My clear understanding was they weren’t going to get the money until President Zelensky committed to pursue the investigations.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Now, with all due respect, ambassador, your clear understanding was obviously wrong because it didn’t happen. President Zelensky didn’t announce he was going to investigate Burisma or the Bidens. He didn’t do a press conference and say, “I’m going to investigate the Bidens. We’re going to investigate Burisma. He didn’t tweet about it and you just told the ranking member he didn’t do the CNN interview and announce he’s going to investigate Burisma or the Bidens.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	So three face to face meetings, it doesn’t come up. No linkage whatsoever. President Zelensky does it announce it before the aid is released on the 11th. And yet you said you have a clear understanding that those two things were going to happen. The money was going to get released, but not until there was an investigation, and that in fact didn’t happen. So what I’m wondering is where’d you get this clear understanding?
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Can you hold one second, ambassador? I’m going to bring you a piece of paper from Ambassador Sondland’s statement. And you can take a look at this. Go ahead though. I’m going to let you finish.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	No. I just want you to have it because I’m going to read it.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	But I want you to go on and finish. You said ambassador, you got this from Ambassador Sondland.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Morrison talked to you, right?
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	I understand. All right. So again, just to recap, you had three meetings with President Zelensky, no linkage in those three meetings came up. Ambassador Zelensky didn’t announce that he was going to do any investigation of the Bidens or Burisma before the aid was released. He didn’t do a tweet, didn’t do anything on CNN. Didn’t do any of that. President Zelensky, excuse me.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And then what you have in front of you is an addendum that Mr. Sondland made to his testimony that we got a couple of weeks ago. It says “Declaration of Ambassador Gordon Sondland, I Gordon Sondland do hereby swear and affirm as follows.” I want you to look at point number two ,bullet point number two, second sentence. “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1st, 2019 in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	This is his clarification. Let me read it one more time. “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1st, 2019 in connection with Vice President Pence’s visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	We’ve got six people having four conversations in one sentence and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding. Even though you had three opportunities with President Zelensky, for him to tell you, “You know what, we’re going to do these investigations to get the aid.” Didn’t tell you three different times. Never makes an announcement, never tweets about it. Never does a CNN interview. Ambassador, you weren’t on the call, were you? You didn’t listen in on President Trump’s call and President Zelensky’s call.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	You never talked with chief of staff Mulvaney.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	You never met the president.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	You had three meetings again with Zelensky that didn’t come up.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And President Zelensky never made an announcement. This is what I can’t believe. And you’re their star witness. You’re their first witness, but you’re the guy, based on this, based on… I mean, I’ve seen church prayer change that are easier to understand than this. Ambassador Taylor recalls, and Mr. Morrison told. Now again, this is, I hereby swear and affirm from Gordon Sondland. “Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1st 20 … this all happens by the way, this all happens by the way, in Warsaw when Vice President Pence meets with President Zelensky and guess what? They didn’t talk about any linkage either.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	They do.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	We got that.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And it’s real clear, right?
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Turn to Mr. Jordan.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	Mr. Ambassador, thank you. Thank you gentleman for yielding. Ambassador Taylor, the gentleman asked if you could be wrong, were you wrong when you said you had a clear understanding that President Zolinsky had to commit to an investigation of Biden’s before the aid got released and the aid got released and he didn’t commit to an investigation?
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	And that’s the point. What you heard did not happen. It didn’t happen. You had three meetings with the guy. He could have told you. He didn’t announce he was going to do an investigation before the aid happen. It’s not just, could it have been wrong? The fact is it was wrong because it didn’t happen. The whole point was you had a clear understanding that aid will not get released unless there’s a commitment. Not maybe, not I think the aid might happen, and it’s my hunch is going to get released. You used clear language, clear understanding and commitment and those two things didn’t happen. So you had to be wrong.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	That’s not what this proceedings about Ambassador Taylor. [crosstalk 00:01:20] That’s not what this whole thing started on.
2019-11-13	Jim Jordan	R-Jordan	Republican	No, that’s good, Mr. Chairman.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to pick up where my colleague across the aisle, Congressman Himes, left off earlier. Respectfully, Dr. Hill, he was not defending you. He was defending himself and Democrats. I want to make sure the record?s very clear. Ranking member Nunes was correct. He correctly noted in his opening that Republicans, not Democrats on this committee, were the first ones to raise the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	The disagreement wasn?t about Russian meddling. The disagreement was about whether or not President Trump conspired with Russia, a false allegation pedaled by the Democrats generally and specifically by some Democrats on this committee. With that, Mr. Holmes, I want to turn to you and the part of the conversation, your testimony, where you said you heard President Trump say, ?Is he going to do the investigation?? And Ambassador Sondland said, ?He?s going to do it. He?ll do anything you ask him to.? Is that right?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	What did President Trump say next?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	He said what?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	What did President Trump say next?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Good. What about Sweden? Good. What about Sweden? Why isn?t that in your statement.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	But it?s the most important part of the conversation.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Respectfully, Mr. Holmes, this impeachment inquiry is based on the call the day before, where President Trump, as part of a bribery scheme, as part of an extortion scheme, as part of a quid pro quo according to the Democrats, demanded investigations in exchange for either military aid or a White House meeting. And the next day, you were witness to President Trump receiving word that the bribery scheme was successful. The extortion scheme was successful. And his response was, ?Good. What about Sweden?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	What was the first thing the president said on the call?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	[crosstalk 01:11:26] you had a clear recollection of his conversation?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	How?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	You think he said, ?I think you?re in Ukraine?? He said what?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	What did you hear President Trump say about ASAP Rocky?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	You said ? How did we go from the conversation was very loud and his voice was recognizable to, as you say here, ?When the conversation shifted, I could only hear Ambassador Sondland?s side of the conversation.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	What did change? It?s important. This was memorable.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	That?s what it was?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Okay. How did the conversation end?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Okay. So to be clear, when President Trump received word that President Zelensky had agreed to the investigations, he said, ?Good. What about Sweden?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Okay. When exactly did Gordon Sondland ask President Zelensky about the investigations?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	When did he ask about the investigations?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Yeah.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Well, it was raised the day before on a call. And the next day, Gordon Sondland said the answer to that was he?s going to do the investigation. So when did he ask about the investigation?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Well, I don?t want to ?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I appreciate that, but I want to make sure the record?s clear that yesterday, Ambassador Sondland testified ?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	? that the topic of conversations did not come up on that day.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I yield back.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thank you, Chair, want to return the favor and recognize my colleague, yield to my colleague, Congressman Conaway.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Mr. Chairman, two quick housekeeping matters. Ask unanimous consent to enter into the record an ABC News story. This one?s from my friend, Mr. Stewart, entitled ?70% of Americans say Trump?s actions tied to Ukraine were wrong,? dated November 18th, 2019.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a New Yorker story entitled ?The invention of the conspiracy theory on Biden and Ukraine: How a conservative dark money group that targeted Hillary Clinton in 2016 spread the discredited story that may lead to Donald Trump?s impeachment,? Jane Marrow, October 4th, 2019.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Good afternoon. Thank you for being here. Dr. Hill, first of all, I thought that was some epic mansplaining that you were forced to endure by my colleague, Mr. Turner, and I want you to know some of us think it was inappropriate, but I appreciate your forbearance.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Let me ask something. I?m fascinated by this meeting, two meetings, really, on July 10th. You have the meeting in Mr. Bolton?s office. Sondland says this thing about investigations, Bolton ends the meeting. Photo. There?s a follow on meeting in the Ward Room and you get there a little late and Vindman is talking to Sondland and they?re already going at it about Sondland?s desire to assert that the meeting?s going to happen if there?s these investigations. Does that sum, in substance, what?s going on?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And what I want to understand is, this isn?t a policy disagreement, right?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	The source of your concern is not a policy disagreement, and it?s not purely a procedural disagreement either [crosstalk 02:34:35] right? About how? Excuse me.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	It?s neither policy nor is it procedure that?s bothering you or, for that matter, the National Security Advisor, Mr. Bolton, right?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I mean it?s not why he sends you down there to see how the meeting?s going.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And in fact he instructs you to go to the lawyer. Ever been instructed to go report something to the NSC lawyer before?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And why did he send you to report this to the lawyer?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Yes, I understand. And you of course, did you concur with this concern that Mr. Bolton had?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And I think you under-
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Right. I think you described it as a political errand and you were doing national security policy is how you distinguish those two channels. Is that fair?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Right, and so is it fair to say that you felt it was improper, what was occurring by Mr. Sondland in the Ward Room?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Here?s my point, if it was improper and you went so far as to report this to the lawyers, what was the nature of your disagreement with Mr. Sondland? Who has come here and said he had no idea that Burisma meant Bidens until much, much later than July 10th. And of course, we know that he and Ambassador Volker had a blizzard of interactions with Mr. Giuliani. They were amending statements, proposed statements for the Ukrainian president. This went on all summer. And yet, how is it that you had this disagreement in front of the Ukrainians, would send him out in the hallway. At some point did he ask, ?I?m just talking about an investigation of corruption generally. What are you getting so worried about?
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	But I thought you said it was pretty obvious to you? Excuse me, I thought-
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I thought it was obvious to you that Burisma meant Bidens.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And you actually treated that as a pretty easy thing to understand. In fact, Mr. Morrison figured it out with a single Google search. But is it credible to you that Mr. Sondland was completely in the dark about this all summer? I mean, you had an argument about it. [crosstalk 02:37:51] Didn?t he say-
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I?m sorry, I couldn?t hear your answer.
2019-11-21	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Well, I want to thank you both for your appearance here today. Yield back, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thanks to Chairman. Professor Turley, I’d like to start where you started, because you said something that, I think, bears repeating.
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	You said, “I’m not a supporter of President Trump. I voted against him in 2016, and I have previously voted for Presidents Clinton and Obama.
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	But despite your political preferences and persuasions, you reached this conclusion: “The current legal case for impeachment is not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects dangerous as the basis for impeachment of an American president.
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So let me start by commending you for being the kind of example of what, hopefully, everyone on this committee will do as we approach the tasks that we have of determining whether or not there were any impeachable offenses here. One of the problems that you’ve articulated as leading you to the conclusion of calling this the, should it proceed, the shortest impeachment proceeding with the thinnest evidentiary record and the narrowest grounds ever attempted to impeach a president is the fact that there has been this ever-changing, constantly evolving, moving target of accusations, if you will.
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	The July 25th phone call started out as an alleged quid pro quo and briefly became an extortion scheme, a bribery scheme. I think it’s back to the quid pro quo. Now, besides pointing out that both Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schiff waited until almost every witness had been deposed before they even started to use the term bribery… I think you’ve clearly articulated why you think the definitions that they have used publicly are flawed, if not unconstitutional, both in the 18th century or in the 21st century. But would you agree with me that bribery, under any valid definition, requires that a specific quid pro quo be proven?
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So, if military aid or security assistance is part of that quid pro quo, where in the July 25th transcript does President Trump ever suggest that he intends to withhold military aid for any reason?
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So, if it’s not in the transcript, then it’s got to come from witness testimony, and I assume you’ve reviewed all the witness testimony. So, you know that no witness has testified that they either heard President Trump or were told by President Trump to withhold military aid for any reason, correct?
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So, let me turn to the issue of obstruction of justice quickly. I think you assumed, as I did, that when Democrats had been talking about obstruction, it was specifically related to the Ukraine issue, and I know you’ve talked about that a lot today. You’ve clearly stated that you think that President Trump had no corrupt intent on page 39 of your report. You said something else, I think, that bears repeating today. You were highlighting the fact that the Democrats appear to be taking the position that if a president seeks judicial review over executive branch testimony or documents subpoenaed by Congress, that rather than letting the courts be the arbiter, Congress can simply impeach the president for obstruction based on that. Did I hear you say that if we were to proceed on that basis that that would be an abuse of power?
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So, if I were to summarize your testimony, no bribery, no extortion, no obstruction of justice, no abuse of power. Is that fair?
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Gentleman’s time has expired. Mr. Richmond.
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Ms. Karlan?
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thank you, gentleman, for yielding. Professor Turley, in the last few days we’ve been hearing that despite no questions to any witnesses during the first two months of the first phase of this impeachment inquiry, that the Democrats may be dusting off the obstruction of justice portion of the Muller report. It seems to me that we all remember how painful it was to listen to the special counsel’s analysis of the obstruction of justice portion of that report. I’d like you to address the fatal flaws from your perspective with regard to the obstruction of justice portion of that-
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I thank my colleague from Florida for yielding. Professor Turley since we last talked based on questioning from my colleagues across the aisle, it does in fact appear that the Democrats do intend to pursue articles of impeachment for obstruction of justice based on the Mueller report. I asked you a question about that. You didn’t really get a chance to give a complete answer in your statement today. You make this statement. I believe an obstruction claim based on the Mueller report would be at odds with the record and the controlling law. The use of an obstruction theory from the Mueller report would be unsupportable in the House and unsustainable in the Senate. Do you remember writing that?
2019-12-04	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Why did you write that?
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thank you chairman. The 299 page Democratic Majority Report mentions the Intelligence Community Inspector General, Michael Atkinson, on pages 26, 33, 138, 140, and 143. Mr. Goldman, you were present for the October 4, 2019, transcribed interview of the Inspector General, Michael Atkinson, correct?
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	On pages 53 to 73 of that transcribed interview, the Inspector General’s testimony confirms the following: That the whistleblower made statements to the Inspector General under penalty of perjury that were not true and correct. That the whistleblower first made statements in writing under penalty of perjury that were not true and correct. The whistleblower then made statements under penalty of perjury that were not true and correct in his or her verbal responses to the Inspector General’s investigative team. Because of the whistleblower’s statements, in writing and verbally, to the Inspector General that were neither true, correct, or accurate. Pages 53 to 73 of that sworn testimony reveal that the Inspector General was not able to answer any questions. None from me about the whistleblower’s contact or communication with Chairman Schiff’s staff, of which Mr. Goldman is a member.
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Mr. Castor, do you remember anywhere in this 299 page report that makes reference to the fact that when the whistleblower started this inquiry, he or she did so by making statements under penalty of perjury that were neither true or correct in writing, and then did so again verbally?
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	After the Inspector General testified on October 4th, and after media reports revealed that the whistleblower and Chairman Schiff did not disclose their prior contacts or communications with one another, the whistleblower contacted the Inspector General to explain why he or she made statements under penalty of perjury in writing and verbally that not true, correct, and accurate. Mr. Castor, is that communication, from the whistleblower to the Inspector General, to explain prior inconsistent statements reflected anywhere in the 299 page report?
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	On October 2nd, Chairman Schiff’s spokesman, Patrick Boland, acknowledged publicly that the outlines of the whistleblower’s accusations against the President had been disclosed to the house intelligence staff, and shared with Chairman Schiff. Mr. Castor, is that disclosure and Mr. Boland’s admission of that disclosure, anywhere in this report?
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	It’s not. I think all members of Congress should be held accountable during this impeachment process, and to that end, if I have made any false statements about the whistleblower or the Inspector General’s testimony today, then I should be held accountable. The way to do that would be to release the Inspector General’s testimony, or even just pages 53 to 73. I would add that there’s nothing in those pages that would in any way identify or place at risk the whistleblower’s identity, nor would it reveal any information that in any way relates to, much less jeopardizes national security.
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Look, maybe there’s a believable explanation for why the whistleblower made statements that weren’t true or accurate about his contact or her contact with Chairman Schiff in writing and then again, verbally. Maybe there’s a good explanation for why the words Congress or congressional committee was confusing or not clear to the whistleblower.
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Maybe there’s a good explanation for why the whistleblower also misled the Inspector General in writing on August 12th, by stating, “I reserve the option to exercise my legal right to contact the committees directly when the whistleblower had in fact already contacted Chairman Schiff’s committee two weeks before he or she wrote that. Maybe there’s a believable reason why Chairman Schiff was not initially truthful about his staff’s communications with the whistleblower. Maybe there’s a good reason that explains all of these statements, in writing and verbally, that just weren’t true and correct. Maybe there is, but there is no good reason for voting to impeach and remove from office and American President without allowing a single question to be asked of a single witness to get an explanation for why the Inspector General was not told the truth about contacts between the whistleblower and Chairman Schiff.
2019-12-09	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	The bottom line is we should all be held accountable. And next November, every member of the House will be asked this question, did you vote to impeach the President without allowing any investigation into why the whistleblower, that started it all, did so by making statements, in writing and verbally, under penalty of perjury that were not true. Democrats may not care if that question ever gets answered, but the voters will. I yield back.
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I thank the Chairman, and Ambassador Yovanovitch, I’d like to join all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in thanking you for your service.
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I’d like to ask you about your earlier testimony about your Senate confirmation, and congresswoman Stefanik had asked you how the Obama/ Biden State Department had prepared you to answer questions about Burisma and Hunter Biden specifically. You recall that?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And she mentioned that you had been asked or been prepared for questions about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Burisma, but I don’t think that you gave us the answer or answers that the Obama/Biden State Department prepared you to give in response to that question. Do you remember what those answers were?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So did they, in the course of that, brief you about the amount of money that Hunter Biden was being by Burisma?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	In preparation for your confirmation. And they thought that a Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma might be significant enough that it would come up during your confirmation, is that correct?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Well, hundreds of questions, but were there hundreds of companies? How many companies other than Burisma did the Obama/Biden State Department prepare you to give answers for? And if so, if there were others, which ones?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	You don’t recall that there were any other companies, is that correct?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	But you specifically recall Burisma?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	All right. Out of thousands of companies in the Ukraine, the only one that you recall, the Obama/Biden State Department preparing you to answer questions about was the one where the Vice President’s son was on the board, is that fair?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	You understood from Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent’s testimony as it’s been related to you that he testified a few days ago, do you understand that that arrangement, Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board caused him enough concern that as he testified in his statement that, “In February of 2015, I raised my concern that a Hunter Biden status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest.” And he went on to talk about the Vice President’s responsibilities over the Ukraine, or over Ukrainian policy as one of those factors. Do you recall that?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Do you agree with that?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	That it was a legitimate concern to raise?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And did you discuss that ever with Mr. Kent?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Shortly before your confirmation in August of 2016, Prosecutor General Shokin was fired by President Poroshenko, correct?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And Prosecutor General Shokin was the one who had opened the investigation into Burisma, correct?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	He was in charge of it at least, at that point in time as the Prosecutor General.
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And are you aware of the very public statements by the Vice President that that firing of the prosecutor general occurred in March of 2016, six hours after the Vice President told President Poroshenko that he needed to fire the prosecutor general or that he wouldn’t receive $1 billion from the United States? Do you recall that?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	All right. And do you think that that raises a potential concern or conflict of interest that the Vice President of the United States was ordering the firing of the prosecutor in charge of a company that has been identified as one that is substantially corrupt?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	But the legitimate concern about Hunter Biden’s role was legitimate, correct?
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Well, based on your testimony Ambassador, I’d like to renew my request, Mr. Chairman, that Hunter Biden’s testimony that has been requested-
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Requested by the Republicans be considered-
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	As legitimate rather than as a sham-
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	As referred to by the Chairman.
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I have a unanimous-
0201-11-15	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I have a unanimous consent request.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thank you chairman. Gentleman, I appreciate both of you being here today. I know it’s been a long day for you. Mr. Morrison I’m going to try and summarize some of what we’ve heard to shorten this. You were on the July 25th call, Colonel Vindman was on the July 25th call, correct?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And I will tell you that he testified earlier today that he heard what he thought was a demand on that call that was improper and felt that he had a duty to report that. I think we’ve established already that he did not discuss or report any of that to you, correct?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	But you did have a discussion with Colonel Vindman about other concerns that he had with the call, and I believe you said the fidelity of the translation, and the fact that you both shared a discussion about there not being a full throated embrace of the Ukrainian reform agenda. Is that fair?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Okay. But with respect to his concern about something improper, specifically at no point did he come to you and say, I heard something that I thought was improper and was a crime.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	No bribe, no extortion, no quid pro quo. All the things that Miss Stefanik asked you?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	All right. And as you were listening, did you hear President Trump make a demand of anything that would constitute a crime?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	You have a law degree?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So you’re at least generally familiar with bribery and extortion, generally.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	All right. But is it fair to say that as you were listening to the call, you weren’t thinking, wow, the President is bribing the President of Ukraine? That never crossed your mind.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Or that he was extorting the President of the Ukraine.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Or doing anything improper?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	All right, and have you heard or read in the media where President Zelinsky agrees with you, and said repeatedly and consistently that he didn’t hear any demand, he didn’t hear any conditions, he didn’t feel any pressure, he didn’t experience anything improper or corrupt on the call?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So did anyone on the national security council after this call express to you that some crime, bribery, extortion, quid pro quo, anything had occurred?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I want to ask you, Mr. Morrison, about the whistleblower complaint. I don’t want to ask you to speculate as to the identity, but I want to ask you about the accusations that started this as to their veracity. First of all, the whistleblower who apparently was not on the call advised the ICIG that he or she was concerned that the President’s conduct constituted under Title 50 USC Section 30.33, “A serious problem, abuse or violation of law or executive order”. Again, to be clear, you didn’t hear a violation of law or executive order as you listened to the call.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	The whistleblower also reported in starting this inquiry, asserted that President Trump, “sought to pressure the Ukrainian leadership to take actions to help the President’s 2020 reelection bid”. President Trump does not mention 2020 during the call, does he?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	President Trump doesn’t mention his reelection bid during the call does he?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And you did not hear President Trump pressure or have a demand of any kind as we’ve already established, correct?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	A whistleblower like Colonel Vindman also uses the word demand.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	No, I said, I’m sorry.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Yeah, the whistleblower, like Colonel Vindman, also uses the word demand. On page four, the whistleblower asserted, “Ambassador Volker and Sondland purportedly provided advice to Ukrainian leadership about how to navigate the demands the President had made of Mr. Zelinsky”. Again, there were no demands from your perspective, Mr. Morrison.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	All right, so speculations about the whistleblower aside with regard to motivations, the fact is that the whistleblower was wrong about many of the facts as well, correct?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I yield back.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thank the gentlemen for yielding. In a press conference last Thursday, speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi said that president Trump committed the impeachable offense of bribery evidenced in his July 25th call transcript with president Zelensky. In concert with that, multiple democratic members of this committee gave TV and radio interviews over this past week discussing how the president’s conduct supported his impeachment for committing bribery.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	All of which struck me as very odd because for the longest time, this was all about quid pro quo according to the whistleblower complaint. But after witness, after witness began saying there was no quid pro quo, or even that quid pro quo was not even possible, we saw a shift from the Democrats. They briefly started to refer to the president’s conduct on the July 25th call as extortion. And now it’s shifted again last week to bribery.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Ms. Williams, you used the word “unusual” to describe the president’s call on July 25th. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman used the word “inappropriate” improper.” I’ve word searched. Each of your transcripts and the word “bribery” or “bribe” doesn’t appear anywhere in that. Ms. Williams, you didn’t. You’ve never used the word “bribery” or “bribe” to explain president Trump’s conduct, correct?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Colonel Vindman, you haven’t either?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	The problem is in an impeachment inquiry or that the speaker of the house says is all about bribery, where bribery is the impeachable offense. No witness has used the word “bribery” to describe president Trump’s conduct, none of them. These aren’t all of the deposition transcripts. These are just the 10 that had been released.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Six weeks of witness interviews in this impeachment inquiry. Hundreds of hours of testimony, thousands of questions asked, thousands of answers given. The number of times that witnesses have been asked any question about whether or not president Trump’s conduct constituted bribery before ambassador Yovanovitch was asked by my colleague Congressman Stewart last Thursday is zero. The number of times witnesses have used the word “bribery” or “bribe” to describe president Trump’s conduct in the last six weeks of this inquiry is zero.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	In fact, in these 3500 pages of sworn deposition testimony and just these 10 transcripts released thus far, the word “bribery” appears in these 3500 pages exactly one time, and ironically it appears not in a description of president Trump’s alleged conduct. It appears in the description of vice president Biden’s alleged conduct.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	This is important because as early as next week, my democratic colleagues are going to say, “We need to vote on the evidence from this impeachment inquiry on the impeachment of the president for bribery.” And they’re going to send a report to the judiciary committee. And because there’s more Democrats than Republicans, it’s going to likely pass.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And when that happens, the American people need to be clear that when the Democrats, what they are describing as bribery, not a single witness is describing as bribery. We’ve heard many times in the course of this proceeding that the facts of the president are not in dispute, but the American people are asking if the facts are the same why do the crimes that the president is being accused of keep changing? Why do we go from quid pro quo to extortion, now to bribery? Chairman Nunez told you the answer. The answer is polling.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Washington Times asked Americans what would be the most damning accusation and it didn’t come back quid pro quo. It didn’t come back extortion, it came back bribery. So this case is all about bribery. Look, it’s bad enough that the Democrats have forbidden white house lawyers from participating in this proceeding. It’s hard enough to defend yourself without your lawyers present.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	But what’s even worse is trying to defend yourself against an accusation that keeps changing in the middle of the proceeding. If Democrats accused the president of a high crime or impeachable offense, he at least ought to know which one it is. And when speaker Pelosi says, “this is all about bribery,” she’s promised us evidence of bribery that would be compelling and overwhelming, and instead it’s invisible. I yield back.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thank you, Chairman. Ms. Williams, you testified that what you noted as being unusual about the call that took place on July 25th was that the president raised what appeared to be a domestic political issue, correct?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	But raising an issue, even one that you thought was unusual, is different than making a demand. Would you agree?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	And as I read your deposition, it didn’t sound like, from your testimony, that you heard what took place on that call as a demand for investigations. Is that fair?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	You didn’t hear a demand?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, you’ve testified and explained to us why, in your mind, it was a demand. And you’ve given us reasons, a disparity of power between the two presidents. And because you did feel that way, you also felt that you had a duty to report what you thought was improper. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Okay. So two different people, two impartial observers. One felt the need to report the call because there was a demand that was improper, and one that didn’t report it to anyone. You didn’t report it to anyone, right, Ms. Williams?
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	So while all this might seem as clear as mud, I think your honest and candid assessments of what you heard on the call tells us what we need to know. We have two independent folks, non-partisans, and I’m not hearing a consensus between the two of you about what exactly you both heard on the call that you heard at the exact same time. And if you can’t reach an agreement with regard to what happened on the call, how can any of us? An impeachment inquiry is supposed to be clear. It’s supposed to be obvious. It’s supposed to be overwhelming and compelling. And if two people on the call disagree honestly about whether or not there was a demand, and whether or not anything should be reported on a call, that is not a clear and compelling basis to undo 63 million votes and remove a president from office.
0201-11-19	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I yield my remaining time to Mr. Jordan.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Mr. Chairman.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Mr. Chairman.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	May I make a parliamentary inquiry?
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Mr. Chairman, this is our first hearing under these new set of rules. House Resolution 660 gives you the discretion to allow yourself and the ranking member periods of extended questions of up to 45 minutes each before other members are allowed to ask questions. If possible, we’d like to know the rules of engagement before we get started. Have you made a decision yet as to how many 45 minute rounds you will allow yourself and the ranking member?
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Mr. chairman, point of order.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Chairman, I sat here through the first 45 minutes and literally had an objection to almost the foundation of every question that Mr. Goldman asked regarding facts not in evidence, leading, but House Resolution 660 does not say that we are under the federal rules of evidence. If it is your position that I should be asserting objections to questions that violate the federal rules of evidence, let me know now, because this hearing’s going to change significantly.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Respectfully, Mr. Chairman, you haven’t answered my question whether or not I should be asserting assumes facts not in evidence or leading objections to questions that are posed from this point forward. That’s my question.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Thank you both for being here. It’s obvious from your testimony today that you both care a great deal about U.S, Ukraine relations. It’s also very clear that you’re optimistic about president Zelensky. Ambassador Taylor, you relayed one of his first acts in office was to remove immunity from deputies, which had long been a source of corruption. I know you had a number of personal dealings with him. Has he given you any reason to question his honesty or his integrity?
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	In your prior deposition, I asked you, and I’ll read it directly, “If nobody in the Ukrainian government is aware of a military hold at the time of the Trump, Zelensky call then as a matter of law, and as a matter of fact, there can be no quid pro quo based on military aid. And to your knowledge, nobody in the Ukrainian government was aware of the hold.” And your answer was, that is correct. Is that still your testimony?
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I’m talking about on July 25th.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	All right. And as it turns out, president Zelensky agreed with you. On October 10th president Zelensky held a press marathon with over 300 reporters where he said repeatedly and consistently over hours and hours that he was not aware of a military hold during the July 25th call. In fact, in his official press release from the Ukrainian government, available on his website that I’ll be introducing into the record, he said, “Our phone conversation bears no relations to arms. They blocked the provision of military assistance prior to our telephone conversation, but the issue had not been discussed during our conversation. I mean, I didn’t even know.” Now, in addition to confirming that because he had no knowledge of it, there was no quid pro quo involving military aid during that call. President Zelensky went on to confirm a number of things that there was no pressure, that there were no conditions, that there were no threats on military aid. There were no conditions or pressure to investigate Burisma or the 2016 election. That there was no blackmail. That there was no corruption of any kind during the July 25th call, again, from his official press release.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Therefore, there was no blackmail because it was not the subject of our conversation with the president of the United States. There were no conditions on the investigation, either because of arms or the situation around Burisma company. He told [inaudible 00:02:35] there was no blackmail. He told the L.A. Times there was no pressure or blackmail from the United States. He told Japan’s Kyoto news, “I was never pressured and there were no conditions being imposed.” He told ABC news and the BBC, “I’m against corruption. This is not corruption. It was just a call.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	The Ukrainian president stood in front of the world press and repeatedly, consistently over and over again, interview after interview said he had no knowledge of military aid being withheld. Meaning no quid pro quo, no pressure, no demands, no threats, no blackmail, nothing corrupt. And unlike the first 45 minutes that we heard from the Democrats today, that’s not secondhand information. It’s not hearsay, it’s not what someone overheard ambassador Sandlin say, that was his direct testimony. Ambassador Taylor, do you have any evidence to assert that president Zelensky was lying to the world press when he said those things? Yes or no?
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	My time is short, yes or no.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Okay, very good. In this impeachment hearing today where we impeach presidents for treason or bribery or other high crimes, where is the impeachable offense in that call? Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call? Shout it out. Anyone?
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I’ve got one minute left.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Let me just make this point.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	I withdraw the question. Let me just make this point …
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Let me ask this question …
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Suspend the time please.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Suspend the time please. I withdrew the question.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Suspend the clock in one minute please.
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Will you restore time to the clock to one minute?
2019-11-13	John Ratcliffe	R-Ratcliffe	Republican	Fine. Mr. Ambassador, I think everyone knows that house Democrats have made up their mind to impeach one president. The question that we’ve just learned is whether or not they’re prepared to impeach two. Because to be clear, if house Democrats impeach president Trump for a quid pro quo involving military aid, they have to call president Zelensky a liar. If they impeach him for abusing his power, or pressuring, or making threats or demands, they have to call president Zelensky a liar to do it. If they impeach president Trump for blackmail or extortion, or making threats or demands, they have to call president Trump a liar to do it.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield to Mr. Ratcliffe five minutes.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Ratcliffe, please let Mr. Holmes answer.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Hill, I don?t think there?s a lot of questions that one of Putin?s primary objectives within the United States is to foment unrest within our nation to cause us to have lost, lose confidence in our elections and the results of the elections, those kinds of things. There is tension though and conducting our business as the way we should and thought playing into Putin?s hands, as an example, while I disagree with what we?re doing here today, it?s under our constitution and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that they are functioning under that constitution. These hearings, this issue, has very divisive within our country and is continuing to push that way.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	I think that plays into Putin?s hands inadvertently. Maybe nothing we can do about that, but there are certain things we can do as individuals that wouldn?t play into his hands and one of them would be that the loser in the 2016 election has, for three years, continued to argue that because she won the popular vote, as she and her friends, she won the popular vote, that somehow the election was inappropriate and that we shouldn?t trust it, that the electoral college victory, which was resounding, shouldn?t be trusted. Does that help Putin or play into the narrative that he would like for us to do that our elections are somehow rigged and shouldn?t be trusted?
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	So the RT, Putin?s? Would you agree with me that RT is a Putin?s propaganda machine here in the United States?
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	So is it appropriate for the RT to be used to affect public policy on our nation? As an example, there?ve been a long series of advertisements, or programs on RT going against fracking, that to saying that?s bad and trying to affect public policy in the United States. Is that appropriate use? Or is that should be, should Americans be paying attention to that?
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Just that the fracking is a controversial issue within our nation. If we did away with fracking, the United States would not be in a position today to dominate the oil production within the world and would play into strengthening Putin?s hands with respect to the oil-
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	So they said that Americans pay attention to RT and are misguided by whatever propaganda he?s going. It?s not in our nation?s best interest.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Holmes, in your role, you?re privileged to an awful lot of stuff. Official things and things that are best kept between you and the official folks that you deal with. Is there an expectation among the principals that you represent that you will exercise some discretion and what you share with others about what goes on?
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	In your deposition, you made the? Well, first off, we had a hard time pinning down the number of people that you?ve actually had this conversation with about the conversation that you overheard. Now our ambassador had no expectation of privacy. He?s blustering around it and what it?s done, but we couldn?t figure out how many people you actually shared that information with. And I would argue that the information is unflattering to the president, unflattering to the ambassador. And that your discretion is at odds here. I mean your testimony or deposition said that you shared that with folks who you thought would find it interesting. Well, I?d argue that everybody on the back row would find it interesting, but I don?t know that that?s necessarily a criterion.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	So on a go forward basis, can you articulate that in the future when you?re privileged to certain circumstances that would be embarrassing to the principal, that if it?s official that you share it with the ambassador, that?s fine, but the folks outside the embassy, or folks even within the embassy, that don?t have a need to know, that you wouldn?t regale them with your recounting of those instances?
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	No, no. You?re? Well-.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	[crosstalk 02:17:04].
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Excuse me, Mr. Holmes. Let me clarify the question.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	It?s my question. You?re exactly right. And I get to clarify my question to get the answer, and I?m hopeful I get a few more seconds because of the interruption from the Chairman. His patience is growing thin. I was working hard not to irritate him again, but I failed again.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	The question is of you, Mr. Holmes. Your discretion. Gordon Sondland did not expect to have privacy, we got that. But you?re going to be in rooms [inaudible 00:02:17:37], you?ve been in room 17 years where people trust that when whatever went on in that room had left, that you kept it to official channels, that you didn?t share all that information with other folks. I?m just asking you to argue for on your own behalf, that ?interesting? is not some sort of a criterion that you would use when you share information from meetings. Simple straightforward question.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	But you did use the word ?interesting? in your deposition [crosstalk 02:18:09]-
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Chairman, that?s patently unfair.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	As you?ve run this entire investigation.
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	But you?re certainly willing to interrupt me during my five minutes. [crosstalk 00:06:40]. You?re the only person on this dais has limited time. You have absolutely unlimited time. You?re the only one that has abused that power and you?re continuing to do that-
2019-11-21	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Does that apply to you as well?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Speaker, I have a… Mr. Chairman, I have a-
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a unanimous dissent request.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a unanimous dissent request.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry, please.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry, please.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Chairman, [inaudible 00:00:58] inquiry.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Thank you, sir. It appears that counsel for the witness this morning has paper copies of the slides that were used during the questioning. If that’s true, does that mean that you and/or your team has been in coordination with him and/or her with respect to her testimony this morning? And if that’s true, how does that comport with H.Res.660 in the fairness that is purportedly associated with that resolution?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Excuse me, you said that the screen in front of them was not working?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, [inaudible 01:02:37] consent to enter the record. Dear Colleague, letter from Speaker Pelosi dated September 23rd. Relevant part reads, “We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate intelligence committees as required by law.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Thank you. I look forward to you honoring that statement from the speaker. Turning this to the ambassador. Ambassador, I, for one, want to thank you so very much for a long service, exemplary service to our country and on behalf of our nation. [inaudible 01:03:07] said about what was going on around the phone call. I’d like to focus more on what’s happened since then to you and your career and what’s going on.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	So when you got the word … Anytime a ambassador changes post there’s a process you go through to depict what you do next, and that happened in this instance. Can you give us a quick statement as to how … what happened when you came back here as to what your next assignment would be at the state?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Sure.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Was that your only choice?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Last [inaudible 01:03:59] Georgetown is fertile ground for State Department recruitment, a future fledgling for service officers, and so they now benefit from your experience and your inspiration to inspire them to spend their professional life in service to our nation.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	You’re a fellow there, you teach classes. How many classes are you teaching?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Defer on that.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	How many students in your class? Approximately.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	All right. Any other responsibilities to the state other than the fellowship at Georgetown?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Okay, I got that. But no necessarily day-to-day things that you’d be responsible for?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Other than not qualifying for overseas stipends and other things, has your compensation been affected by being recalled the way you were?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Okay. I’m worried about the way you might be treated by your fellow employees of the state. Any negative … Do they hold you in less high regard than they used to as a result of this? Do they shun you at the lunch counter? I mean, did they treat you badly as a result of the way you were treated by the president?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Okay, so the folks that you respect the most still respect you and appear to hold you in high regard and high affection?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Okay. George Kent was in here a couple of days ago. He made some exemplary statements about you, really glowing. All of us, I think, would like to be the recipient of something that worthy, and I believe you are as well. Any reason on earth that you can think of that George Kent would be saying that because of some reason other than the fact that he believes it in his heart of hearts?
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Well, I mean, like somebody paid him to do it.
0201-11-15	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	So you and I agree that we think he was sincere in that bragging on you, and that’s all post recall episode that was very much in the discussion this morning. Well, I’m glad that your colleagues … I would have expected nothing … any different from your colleagues at state to continue to treat you with the high regard that you’ve earned over all these years of great service. I hope that whatever you decide to do after the Georgetown fellowship, that you’re as successful there as you’ve been in the first 33 years. With that, I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Jordan.
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. This morning we heard much about July 25th call in which president asked for a favor, at least in Lieutenant Colonel Denman’s mind, that was equivalent to a demand, an order, a requirement. And yet in the last part of the conversation between the two heads of state, President Trump talks about a prosecutor he’s particularly in favor of, and would like to see stay there. And Zelensky though says, Mr. President, no, since we’ve won the absolute majority in our parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate. Does that, to either one of you, does that sound like a Head of State who’s been cowed or bullied, and is under the thumb of the President of the United States?
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	All right. The impact of the pause that occurred, the 55 day pause in the lethal assistance, or the security assistance, none of us had really understood exactly what happened during that timeframe. No one knew about it other than internal US folks until late August, and so the Russians would not necessarily have known about it. The potential impact, and I agree with on Russia’s interpretation of our support for Ukraine wasn’t known until those last 14 days, but the impact on the lethal aid that they already had, should Russia had tried to move the line of contact further West with their tanks, would the lethal assistance that we’d already given been available to them to push back on that?
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Mr. Morrison, comments?
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Okay. So the most lethal weapon that President Trump provided to the Ukrainians that President Obama and his national policy which he set was available to them, should the Russians have pushed their tanks west. The javelins?
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Throughout that process, even with the pause, even with all the stuff that was going on?
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	Okay. Associated Press reporting that, Ambassador Volker, you mentioned it earlier, that the Russians in an act of war took two gunships, and a tug, and 24 sailors last November. And yet the Russians have now given the 24 sailors back in September, and the Associated Press is reporting today that the they’ve given the gunboats and the tug back, does that sound like Ukraine is inept at being able to negotiate with the Russians because they’re wounded in some way by our actions?
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	All right, thank you sir. Mr Chairman, I would like as a personal request, a request at you and or one of your lawyer members on the committee that are lawyers to put into the record the federal statute that provides for the absolute immunity or right to an immunity that you’ve exerted over and over and over. I don’t think it’s there, but if it is in fact a federal statute and or a brief that you can cite, put that into the record so that we all know that, and before you get mad and accuse me of wanting to out the whistleblower, you get upset every time somebody accuses you personally of knowing who the whistleblower is. I get upset every time you, anonymity, excuse me, anonymity every time you accuse me of simply, because I want to know the whistle blower, we want to know what’s going on, that we want to out that interviewer, that’s unfair for you to make that accusation, and I get just as mad.
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	This is about leveling the playing field between our two teams. Your team knows the whistle blower, they have intimate knowledge of who he or she is, the IGIC, ICIG even even mentioned NDCA biases. Your team fully understands that, our team should fully understand that, it is simply leveling the playing field. And I know that you’ve overrun my request for a closed door subpoena. I understand that, but I do think that it’s important that you put into the record the basis on which you continue to assert this absolute right to anonymity. Excuse me, I misspoke earlier. Anonymity by the whistle blower. Also, the speaker on September the 23rd issued a, Dear Colleague, that’s a document that we all use to talk to each other. It’s went to 434 other members of Congress. It was intended to be the truth. It was intended to be straight forward.
0201-11-19	M. Conaway	R-Conaway	Republican	She says in that Dear Colleague that the whistleblower has by law, is required to testify to the House and the Senate intelligence committees. Now you’re defining the speaker in this regard, understand that’s between you and her, but if she’s correct, and you’re defining the law, if on the other hand she misled us into thinking something that was not true, then I think you need to tell the speaker that she needs to retract that Dear Colleague letter, at least set the record straight is the whistleblower required by law as the speaker said to testify to us or not, and what is this absolute right to anonymity that you question? With that I yield back.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	The will the American people also elected Donald Trump to be the president of the United States in the 2016 election and there’s one party that can’t seem to get over it. Now, we understand the fact that in 2018 you took the house of representatives and we haven’t spent our time during your tenure in power trying to remove the speaker of the house, trying to de-legitimize your ability to govern. Frankly, we’d love to govern with you. We’d love to pass USMCA. We’d love to put out a helping hand to our seniors and lower prescription drug prices. It’s the will of the people you ignore when you continue down this terrible road of impeachment.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Professor Gaetz, you gave money to Barack Obama, right?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Four times?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a series of unanimous consent requests relating Professor Feldman’s work. The first, Noah Feldman, Trump’s wiretap tweets raised the risk of impeachment-
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	We can provide it to you as it’s typical first terms.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Very well. Thank you.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Feldman wrote articles entitled, “Trump’s Wiretap Tweets Raise Risk of Impeachment.” He then wrote, “Mar-a-Lago ad belongs in impeachment file.” And then Mr. Jake Flanagan wrote, “A Harvard law professor thinks Trump could be impeached over fake news accusations.” My question, Professor Feldman, is since you seem to believe that the basis for impeachment is even broader than the basis that my Democrat colleagues have laid forward, do you believe your outside of the political mainstream on the question of impeachment?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Did you write an article entitled it’s hard to take impeachment seriously now?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	And in that article, did you write-
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Hold on I’m limited on time.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	So did you write-
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	… “Since 2018 mid-term election house, Democrats have made it painfully clear that discussing impeachment is primarily or even exclusively a tool to weaken President Trump’s chances in 2020.” Did you write those words?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Thank you. I appreciate your testimony. Professor Karlan, you gave 1000 bucks to Elizabeth Warren, right?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	You gave 1200 bucks to Barack Obama?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	And you gave 2000 bucks to Hillary Clinton?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Why so much more for Hillary than the other two?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Those aren’t the only folks that you’ve been giving to. Have you ever been on a podcast called Versus Trump?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	On that, do you remember saying the following, “Liberals tend to cluster more, conservatives, especially very conservative people tend to spread out more perhaps because they don’t even want to be around themselves?” Did you say that?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Do you understand how that reflects contempt on people who are conservative?
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Professor, hold on. Again, I’m very limited on time, Professor.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	And so I just have to say when you talk about how liberals want to be around each other and cluster, and conservatives don’t want to be around each other and so they have to spread out, it makes people … You may not see this from the ivory towers of your law school, but it makes actual people in this country feel like-
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Excuse me, you don’t get to interrupt me on this time. Now, let me also suggest that when you invoke the president’s son’s name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump, that does not lend credibility to your argument. It makes you look mean. It makes you look like you’re attacking someone’s family, the minor child of the president of the United States. So let’s see if we can get into the facts to all of the witnesses.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	If you have personal knowledge of a single material fact in the Schiff report, please raise your hand. And let the record reflect no personal knowledge of a single fact. And you know what? That continues on the tradition that we saw from Adam Schiff, where Ambassador Taylor could not identify an impeachable offense. Mr. Ken never met with the president. Fiona Hill never heard the president reference anything regarding military aid.
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr. Hale was unaware of any nefarious activity with aid. Colonel Vindman even rejected the new Democrat talking point that bribery was invoked here. Ambassador Volker denied that there was a quid pro quo and Mr. Morrison said there was nothing wrong on the call. The only direct evidence came from Gordon Sondland who spoke to the president of the United States and the president said, “I want nothing. No quid pro quo.” And you know what? If wiretapping the political opponents is an impeachable offense-
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	… I look forward to reading that inspector general’s report-
2019-12-04	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	… because maybe it’s a different president we should be impeaching.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr. Chairman, could we get a copy of the slide deck? We can’t see… I just want to see-
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	But we can’t see the stuff. Can we just get a copy of them?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr. Chairman. I can see now. I appreciate the accommodation. Well the monitor was turned. Now we can see, thank you.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	The last public opinion poll I saw showed Congress had an approval rating at about 9% by contrast. Muammar Gaddafi had an approval rating at 13% and his own people dragged him in the streets and killed him. This impeachment process demonstrates the worst in us and it is depriving us the opportunity to raise our gaze and meet the needs of the American people. Unless you have bipartisan consensus, impeachment is a divisive issue in the country, many people would think it’s being done for political reasons, Nancy Pelosi May, 2018.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Here we are in the most partisan presidential impeachment in American history. Matter of fact, when we opened the inquiry, no Republicans voted with the Democrats and you even had Democrats voting with us in the only bipartisan vote to shut down this impeachment. That brings us to your role, Mr. Goldman, are you here as a partisan advocate for the Democrat position or are you here as a nonpartisan investigator of the facts?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Are you a partisan?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr. Castor, how long have you worked for the house?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	And same question Mr. Goldman.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr. Castor, do you make political donations?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr. Goldman, same question. Do you make political donations?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	As a matter of facts you’ve given tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Right?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Have you given over 100,000 to-
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	I just want to know the number, I don’t really care the basis. Have you given more than a 100,000 bucks to democrats?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	The basis. I just want the number. So it’s tens… I think Mr. Burke-
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Do you know how much money Mr. Burke has given Democrats.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Would it surprise you if it’s more than a 100,000?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	So you gave tens of thousands-
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	… and Mr. Burke gave a whole more than a 100,000. Do you think if you’d given more money, you might’ve been able to ask questions and answer them like Mr. Burke did? I guess it’s something you’re still pondering. Mr. Castor, have you ever tweeted anything at the president?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Mr Goldman, same question.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	As a matter of fact this is one of those tweets, right? And you said nothing in the dossier is proven false, but in fact the dossier said that there was a Russian consulate in Miami when there isn’t. The dossier said that Michael Cohen had a meeting in Prague when he didn’t. The dossier said that Michael Cohen’s wife was Russian, she’s in fact Ukrainian. So as we sit here today where you’ve, I guess got a tweet mentioning a pee tape presenting yourself not as a partisan hired by the Democrats to pursue the president. Do you regret this tweet?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	I just want to know if you regret the tweet Mr. Goldman?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	Do you regret it?
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	You either regret it or you don’t regret it-
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	I guess you don’t want to answer the question. You know what, Mr. chairman, earlier in this hearing you said in your opening statement that there is nothing more urgent than impeachment right now. This is the most urgent thing we could possibly do. Well, you know what? If you’re a senior right now and you can’t afford your prescription drugs, that’s more urgent than this. If you’re a manufacturer wanting to dominate the Western hemisphere with the passage of the US MCA, that is more urgent.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	If you’re a farmer who wants to open markets so that your family can survive and thrive, that is a lot more urgent than this partisan process. If you’re a desperate family member watching someone succumb to addiction, solving the opioid problem, probably more urgent than this partisan impeachment. If you’re a member of the next generation dealing with the challenges of extinction and climate change, a budget that’s out of control, driving up the credit card of young people in this country and what they’ll have to pay back as a consequence of our poor decisions, likely more urgent.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	But house Democrats have failed at all of these things. Matter of fact, I’d say the only thing under the Christmas tree for most Americans would be a lump of coal, but I think they’re against coal too. The only thing under the Christmas tree for Americans would be impeachment and investigations. I’ve heard over and over Democrats say that this is all about the president’s personal interest and that he abandoned the national interest and it begs an analysis of how the nation is doing. In November 266,000 jobs created, 80,000 over the average. Half a million more manufacturing jobs in the Trump presidency, 700,000 construction jobs. We are doing better than ever before. The American people are thriving. Why won’t you help us move along the critical issues that are far more important than your partisan impeachment.
2019-12-09	Matt Gaetz	R-Gaetz	Republican	The implication is that we want Schiff in that chair, not you. The implication is the person that wrote the report is the person that should come and present it and you weren’t elected by anybody, and you’re here giving this testimony in place off the Chairman. I hope that clears up the implication.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The president has regularly and recently solicited foreign interference in our upcoming elections. Professor Turley warns that this is an impulse buy moment and suggest that the house should pause. Professor Karlan, do you agree with professor Turley?
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you. Professor Karlan, In 30 seconds or less, tell us why you believe the president’s misconduct was an abuse of power so egregious that it merits the drastic remedy of impeachment?
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you very much. One of the framers of our constitution, Edmund Randolph, who, at one time, was mayor of Williamsburg, Virginia. Warren does that quote, “The executive will have great opportunities of abusing his power.” Professor Feldman, people like mayor Randolph rebelled because of the tyranny of a king. Why were the framers so careful to avoid the potential for a president to become so tyrannical and abusive? And what did they do to protect against it?
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you professor Feldman. I now want to discuss how the framers concerns about abuse of power relate to president Trump’s misconduct. On July 25th, president Trump said to president Zelensky quote, “I would like you to do us a favor, though.” Professor Feldman, when president Trump made use of the words ‘favor, though’, do you believe that the president was benignly asking for favor? And how is the answer to that question relevant to whether the president abused his power?
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Other witnesses have also testified that it was their impression that when president Trump said, ” I would like you to do us a favor, though,” that he was actually making a demand and not a request. Professor Feldman, how does Lieutenant Colonel Vindmans testimony that the president’s statement was a demand because of the power disparity between the two countries relate back to our framers concerns about the president’s abuse of power?
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you. We’ve also heard testimony that the president withheld a White House meeting and military aid in order to further pressure Ukraine to announce investigations of vice president Biden and the 2016 election. Professor Karlan, is that why your testimony concluded that the president abused his power?
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	All right, thank you. A president holding an American ally over a barrel to expect to extract personal favors is deeply troubling. This is not an impulse buy moment, it’s a break the glass moment, and impeachment is the only appropriate remedy. And with that I will yield back.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you. I was struck this morning by the same thing as all my friends and colleagues on this side of the room. Chairman Nadler actually began this morning with the outrageous statement that the facts before us are undisputed. Of course, everyone here knows that that’s simply not true. Every person here, every person watching at home knows full well that virtually everything here is disputed from the fraudulent process and the broken procedure to the Democrats unfounded claims, and the full facts are obviously not before us today.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	We’ve been allowed no fact witnesses here at all. For the first time ever, this committee, which is the one in Congress that has the actual jurisdiction over impeachment is being given no access to the underlying evidence that Adam Schiff and his political accomplices claim supports this whole charade. This is just a shocking denial of due process.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	And I want to say to our witnesses, I’m also a constitutional law attorney and under normal circumstances, I really would greatly enjoy an academic discussion with your debate about the contours of Article 2 Section 4, but that would be an utter waste of our time today because as it has been highlighted so many times this morning, this whole production is a sham and a reckless path to a predetermined political outcome.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	And I want you to know it’s an outcome that was predetermined by our Democrat colleagues a long time ago. The truth is, house Democrats have been working to impeach President Donald J. Trump since the day he took his oath of office. Over the past three years, they’ve introduced four different resolutions seeking to impeach the president. Almost exactly two years ago, as one of the graphics up here shows, December 6 2017, 58 house Democrats voted to begin impeachment proceedings.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Of course, that was almost 20 months before the famous July 25th phone call with Ukraine’s president, Zelensky. And this other graphic up here is smaller, but it’s interesting too. I think it’s important to reiterate for everybody watching at home that of our 24 Democrat colleagues and friends on the other side of the room today, 17 out of 24 have already voted for impeachment. Let’s be honest. Let’s not pretend that anybody cares anything about what’s being said here today or the actual evidence or the facts.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	As Congresswoman Lofgren said, “We come with open minds.” That’s not happening here so much for an impartial jury. Several times this year, leading Democrats have frankly admitted in various interviews and correspondence that they really believe this entire strategy is necessary because, why? Because they want to stop the president’s reelection. Even Speaker Pelosi said famously last month, “It is dangerous to allow the American people to evaluate his performance at the ballot box.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Speaker Pelosi has it exactly backwards. What is dangerous here is the precedent, all this is setting for the future of our Republic. I love what Professor Turley testified to this morning. He said, “This is simply not how the impeachment of a president is done.” His rhetorical question to all of our colleagues on the other side is still echoing throughout this chamber. He asked you to ask yourselves, where will this and where will you stand next time when this same kind of sham impeachment process is initiated against a president from your party? The real shame here today is that everything in Washington has become bitterly partisan and this ugly chapter is not going to help the that. It’s going to make things really that much worse. President Turley said earlier that we are now living in the era that was feared by our founders. What Hamilton referred to as a period of agitated passions. I think that says it so well. This has indeed become an age of rage.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	President Washington warned in his farewell address in 1796 that, “Extreme partisanship would lead us to the ruins of public liberty.” Those were his words. This hyper-partisan impeachment is probably one of the most divisive and destructive things that we could possibly do to our American family. Let me tell you what I heard from my constituents in multiple town halls and meetings back in my district just two days ago, the people of this country are sick of this.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	They’re sick of the politics of personal destruction. They’re sick of this toxic atmosphere that is being created here, and they’re deeply concerned about where all this will lead us in the years ahead. Rightfully so. You know what the greatest threat is? The thing that ought to keep every single one of us up at night is the rapidly eroding trust of the American people in their institutions.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	One of the critical presuppositions and foundations of a self-governing people in a constitutional republic is that they will maintain a basic level of trust in their institutions, in the rule of law, in the system of justice, in the body of elected representatives, their citizen legislators in the Congress. The greatest danger of this fraudulent impeachment production is not what happens this afternoon or by Christmas or in the election next fall.
2019-12-04	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	The greatest danger is what this will do in the days of head to our 243-year experiment in self-governance. [inaudible 01:26:40] foolish new precedent. This Pandora’s box will have, upon our beleaguered nation six or seven years from now, a decade from now in the ruins of public liberty that are being created by this terribly shortsighted exercise today. God help us. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Mr. Chairman, point of order.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Under Resolution 660 we’re supposed to follow the Federal Rules of Evidence, is that right? What is it-
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	What are the rules? What are the objections that we’re able to me.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	It is a point of order. There’s no rules here.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Where’s the list of rules?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	We allow for virtually anything then.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to get us back to the undisputed facts of the president’s abuse of power. Mr Goldman, as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, when you prosecuted drug conspiracy cases, was it standard practice for drug kingpins to try to beat the case by distancing themselves from the conspiracy and blaming their accomplices for the crime?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Okay. I’d like to ask some questions about the president’s role in what Ambassador Bolton referred to as a drug deal. Did the testimony and evidence compiled by the intelligence committee established the fact that with respect to Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani was at all times working on behalf of President Trump?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you. And on May 9, 2019, Rudy Giuliani on behalf of his client, President Trump, spoke with a New York Times reporter about his planned trip to Ukraine and on that trip he planned to meet with president Zelensky, he said, and urge him to pursue investigations relating to the Bidens and to the debunked theory that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Isn’t that correct?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	And Mr. Giuliani told the reporter that his trip was not about official US foreign policy and that the information he sought would be very, very helpful to his climate client, meaning it would be helpful to President Trump. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	That’s correct. And there is no doubt, Mr. Goldman, that investigations of the Bidens and the 2016 election meddling were in fact not about us policy, but were about benefiting Trump’s reelection. Correct?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	And on July 25, President Trump placed that fateful phone call to President Zelensky and he asked President Zelensky to investigate the Biden’s. Correct?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	And on that call, President Trump told Zelensky, “I will have Mr. Giuliani to give you a call.” Correct?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	And on October 2 and October 3, President Trump once again made explicit that he and Mr. Giuliani were intent on making these investigations happen. Correct?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Mr Goldman, the evidence shows a course of conduct by President Trump and his agents. Does it not?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	It shows a common plan. Correct?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	It shows a common goal?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	And the goal was to get foreign help for the 2020 election. Correct?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	And, Mr. Goldman, who was the kingpin of that plan?
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you, Mr Goldman. Ambassador Bolton called it a drug deal. As a kingpin, President Trump tried to force a foreign government to interfere in the upcoming presidential election. The evidence is undisputed and overwhelming that Rudy Giuliani acted as part of a conspiracy with President Trump to obtain Ukrainian help for President Trump in the 2020 election. This was not just a hurtful drug deal. This was an attempt to undermine the very fabric of our democracy. The framers feared most how foreign influence could turn a president into.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	… most. How foreign influence could turn a President into a despate, so they adopted impeachment as a backstop to protect our democracy. The facts, ladies and gentlemen, demand that we use that remedy today. And with that yield back.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. This has been a truly extraordinary and historically unprecedented hearing. It has frankly been an outrageous violation of due process. A series of violations of due process. In fact, let me review the past seven and a half hours. In the beginning of our proceedings today, I asked chairman Nadler if Mr. Burke was appearing here as a staff member or as a witness, but the chairman gave strangely conflicting answers to that important question.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	When I objected under house rule 17 that Mr. Burke was repeatedly embracingly steamrolling over house decorum rules and using language that impugn the motives of the president of the United States and suggested he is disloyal to his country. Chairman Nadler insisted that those words could not be taken down and stricken from the record saying, “The rules don’t apply here because Mr. Burke is merely appearing as a staffer.” But later chairman Nadler stated the opposite and declared that Mr. Burke was appearing to present the Democrat members report as their representative, which would of course mean that the member rule should apply.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Then Mr. Burke was allowed to switch places and turned from witness to questioner. That’s extraordinarily bizarre of course, but it’s entirely consistent with this whole impeachment circus. As everybody knows, until chairman Adam Schiff was allowed in the opening act of this circus to serve as the judge, jury, prosecutor, witness coach and case strategy chief all in one. So much for due process.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Under the Democrats haphazardly drawn special parameters for these special hearings. House resolution 660 Mr. Burke was then allowed to join the elected members of Congress on this dias and ask 45 minutes of questions of his fellow witness Mr. Castor. When he was argumentative, assumed critical facts is not an evidence, engage in speculation and committed countless other violations of regular house rules and the federal rules of civil procedure. I objected. But was then ruled out of order by our chairman Nadler who informed all of us that while house resolution 660 specifically provides for objections, it lists none of them.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	The Democrats have ignored every request of ours to obtain a list of what rules and objections would be enforced and applicable today. Again, so much for due process and fairness. A month ago, listen, a month ago, the Republican members of this committee formally requested all documents related to the impeachment investigation, but chairman Nadler and Schiff withheld everything until you know when? Saturday afternoon. That’s right, less than 48 hours before this hearing, they dumped approximately 8,000 pages of documentation on us while we were back home in our districts. They intentionally made it literally impossible for us to review all material in any meaningful way, mere hours before this fateful hearing.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	What’s worse is that the documents they decided to dump on us are not all of the underlying records we need to review, but rather only a partial redacted and bias subset of information that they think will advance their false narrative. And as has been mentioned here, we’re being allowed no minority day hearing, which is required by regular house rules. Now, I’d love to cross examine Mr. Burke himself, but chairman Nadler’s special and mysterious rules for this hearing won’t allow it. I notice he’s disappeared from the hearing room.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	I would love to ask him under oath about his own biases, because he hammered here over and over today the importance of fairness and objectivity and accuracy and he insisted that everything here has to be unbiased. But if he was under oath here, he would be forced to admit that FEC records show that he has personally donated approximately $99,000 to the Democrat candidates over the years, including sizable donations to Hillary Clinton for president and also donated to pass Trump opponents including Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	Mr. Burke appeared here as a fact witness and a finder of fact, but in our system, a finder of fact is supposed to be fair and impartial. He’s supposed to be an umpire. The problem with all this and the problem that everybody at home can see with their own eyes is that the umpires in this high stakes game are parading around the field in the majority team’s jerseys. The report of evidence released by Republican committee staff on December 2nd carefully documents that in the hearings that led us to this point today, chairman Schiff directed witnesses called by the Democrats not to answer Republican questions.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	He rejected witnesses, identified Republicans who would have injected some semblance of fairness and objectivity, and he denied Republican subpoenas for testimony in documents violating the Democrats own rules to vote down those subpoenas with no notice to Republicans. Chairman Schiff also publicly fabricated evidence about president Trump’s July 25th phone call and he misled the American public about his interactions with the anonymous whistle blower to selectively seek information to paint misleading public narratives.
2019-12-09	Mike Johnson	R-Johnson	Republican	The anonymous whistleblower reportedly acknowledged having a professional relationship with vice president Biden and obviously his motives, biases, and credibility are central to this case, but we can’t question it. This is not new process. This is not the rule of law. This is not how to impeach an American president and this is not how we’re supposed to run a country. It can’t be. 17 out of 24 of our colleagues over there already voted to proceed with impeachments before we started all this. They’ve already made up their minds. They were prejudice before he walked in, but the American people are not. Fairness still matters, truth matters and the people can see clearly that this is a sham. I yield back.
2019-12-04	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Oh, it’s just past five o’clock and a lot of families are just getting home from work right now. They’re turning on the TV and they’re wondering what they’re watching on TV. They’re asking themselves, “Is this a rerun, because I thought I saw this a couple of weeks ago?” But no, this is not a rerun, unfortunately. This is act two of the three-part tragedy, the impeachment of President Trump. And what we’re seeing here is a several very accomplished Constitutional scholars attempting to divine the intent, whether it’s of the president or of the various witnesses who appeared during the Schiff hearings, and it’s very frustrating to me as a member of the Judiciary Committee, why we are where we are today.
2019-12-04	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	I asked to be a member of this committee because of its storied history because it was the defender of the Constitution, because it was one of the oldest committees in the Congress established by another Virginian, John George Jackson. It’s because two of my immediate predecessors, Congressman Bob Goodlatte, who chaired this committee and Congressman Caldwell Butler also served on this committee, but the committee that they served under, served on, is dead. That committee doesn’t exist anymore. That committee is gone.
2019-12-04	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Apparently now we don’t even get to sit in the Judiciary Committee Room. We’re in the Ways and Means Committee Room. I don’t know why. Maybe because there’s more room maybe because the portraits of the various chairman whose … would be staring down at us might just intimidate the other side as they attempt what is essentially a sham impeachment of this precedent. You know, looking at where we are, the lack of the use of the Rodino rules in this process is shameful. The fact that we got witness testimony for this hearing this morning is shameful. The fact that we got the Intelligence Committee report yesterday, 300 pages of it, is shameful.
2019-12-04	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	I watched the Intelligence Committee hearings from the back, although I couldn’t watch them all because the Judiciary Committee actually scheduled business during the Intelligence Committee hearings, so the Judiciary Committee members weren’t able to watch all of the hearings. But I didn’t get to … I get to read the transcripts of the hearings that were held in private. I was not able to be a part of the Intelligence Committee hearings that were in the SCIF. We haven’t seen the evidence from the Intelligence Committee yet. We’ve asked for it. We haven’t received it. We haven’t heard from any fact witnesses yet before we get to hear from these Constitutional scholars about whether or not the facts rise to the level of an impeachment impeachable offense. Mr. Turley, it’s not just your family and dog who are angry. Many of us on this committee are angry. Many of us watching at home across America are angry because this show has degenerated into a farce.
2019-12-04	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	And as I said, the Judiciary Committee of my predecessors is dead. I look to a former chairman, Daniel Webster, who said, “We are all agents of the same supreme power, the people.” And it’s the people who elected this president in 2016 and it’s the people who should have the choice as to whether or not to vote for this president in 2020, not the members of this committee, not Speaker Nancy Pelosi and not the members of this House of Representatives. It should be the people of the United States who get to decide who their president is in 2020.
2019-12-04	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	I asked several questions about obstruction of justice to Mr. Mueller when he testified. Mr. Turley, I know that you mentioned obstruction of justice several times in your testimony. I want to yield to Mr. Ratcliffe to ask a concise question about that issue.
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last week, I expressed concern regarding the deeply flawed and partisan process the Democrat majority has been undertaking during this impeachment inquiry. Mr. Chairman, I am particularly reminded of your quote, “There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment substantially supported by one of our major political parties and largely opposed by the other. Such an impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come and will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions.” You made that statement back in 1998.
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Now, I’m glad we’re moving on to presenting the “evidence” gathered in this report. Not to hear from direct fact witnesses, but a 300-page report that’s built largely on hearsay, opinion, and speculation. And I’m especially outraged that the purported author of it, Chairman Schiff, is not here to answer our questions today. Now that we have the report and can discuss the facts within or the lack thereof, there are four facts that will never change. Both President Trump and President Zelensky say there was no pressure. Second, the call transcript shows no conditionality between aid and an investigation.
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Three, Ukrainians were not aware that aid was withheld when the President spoke and fourth, Ukraine didn’t open an investigation but still received the aid and a meeting with President Trump. I want to move on to the idea of hearsay and the fact that this report contains so much of it and relies on so much of it. Mr. Castor, did the Democrats’ impeachment report rely on hearsay to support their assertions?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	How many times were you able to find assertions based on hearsay?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Can you give us some of the examples of the hearsay being relied on by the majority to make their case?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Did you also find instances where the Democrats’ report used witnesses, speculations and presumptions?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Castor, I want to move onto foreign policy and the idea that somehow, the President was abusing foreign policy. Repeatedly, witnesses came before the Intelligence Committee and talked about how the President was operating outside the bounds of the process for using norms. The President sets foreign policy, correct?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	And from where does he derive that power?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Article II, Section II, in fact.
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Can you give us examples of these members of the foreign policy establishment who took issue with the President’s foreign policy direction and choices?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Is it safe to say there’s another reason the President’s skeptical of relying on some of these individuals to carry out his foreign policy goals like rooting out corruption in Ukraine?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Is that maybe why he instead relied on Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and others?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Would it be appropriate in any investigation of corruption in Ukraine to exempt or remove say, a political supporter?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Would it be inappropriate to remove a political opponent?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Would it be appropriate to remove the son of a political opponent from any investigation involving Ukrainian corruption?
2019-12-09	Ben Cline	R-Others	Republican	Thank you for those answers. Mr. Chairman, I go back to what you said this morning about the facts being undisputed. I would argue that the facts in fact are disputed, and what you contend are facts are in fact, not. They are witness presumptions, hearsay and speculation. And the facts here are in fact that this is the shortest impeachment in US history based on the thinnest of evidentiary records and on the narrowest grounds. Mr. Chairman, this impeachment process is a farce and a stain on the committee, and on the House of Representatives and I yield back.
2019-12-04	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the record a letter I wrote and sent to you asking, calling on you to cancel any and all future impeachment hearings and outlining how the process-
2019-12-04	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Thank you. During an interview, Mr. Chairman, on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on November 26, 2018, Chairman Nadler outlined a three pronged test that he said would allow for a legitimate impeachment proceeding. Now I quote Chairman Nadler’s remarks, and this is what he said.
2019-12-04	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	There really are three questions, I think. First, has the President committed impeachable offenses? Second, do those offenses rise to the gravity that’s worth putting the country through the drama of impeachment? And number three, because you don’t want to tear the country apart. You don’t want half of the country to say to the other half for the next 30 years, “We won the election. You stole it from us.” You have to be able to think at the beginning of the impeachment process that the evidence is so clear of offenses so grave that once you’ve laid out all of the evidence, a good fraction of the opposition, the voters will reluctantly admit to themselves they had to do it. Otherwise, you have a partisan impeachment which will tear the country apart. If you meet these three tests, then I think you do the impeachment.
2019-12-04	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	And those were the words of Chairman Nadler. Now, let’s see if Chairman Nadler’s three prong test has been met. First, has the President committed an impeachable offense? No. The evidence and testimony has not revealed any impeachable offense. Second, do those offenses
2019-12-04	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	… offense. Second, do those offenses rise to the gravity that’s worth putting the country through the drama of impeachment? Again, the answer is no. There is nothing here that rises to the gravity that’s worth putting the country through the drama of impeachment. And third, have the Democrats laid out a case so clear that even the opposition has to agree? Absolutely not. You and House Democrat leadership are tearing apart the country. You said the evidence needs to be clear. It is not. You said offenses need to be grave. They are not. You said that once the evidence is laid out that the opposition will admit. They had to do it. That has not happened. In fact, polling and the fact that not one single Republican voted on the impeachment inquiry resolution or on the Schiff report reveal the opposite is true. In fact, what you and your Democratic colleagues have done is opposite of what you said had to be done.
2019-12-04	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	This is a partisan impeachment and it is tearing the country apart. I take this all to mean that Chairman Nadler, along with the rest of the Democratic caucus is prepared to continue these entirely partisan unfair proceedings and traumatize the American people, all for a political purpose. I think that’s a shame. That’s not leadership. That’s a sham. And so I ask, Mr. Turley, has Chairman Nadler satisfied his three-pronged test for impeachment?
2019-12-04	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Thank you. And I want to correct something for the record as well. Repeatedly today and other days, Democrats have repeated what was said in the text of the call. Do me a favor though … And they imply it was against President Biden … to investigate President Biden. It was not. It was not. In fact, let me read what the transcript says. It says, the President Trump, “I would like you to do as a favor though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your own wealthy people.” It says nothing about the Biden, so please stop referencing those two together and I yield back.
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. chairman. My first two questions are for the American people. America, are you sick and tired yet of this impeachment sham? And America, would you like Congress to get back to work and actually get something done? Cause I sure would. Mr. Castor, the rest of the questions are for you and I would like yes or no answers if possible. Mr. Castor, my first question is important. Did any of the Democrats back witnesses establish that the President had committed bribery, extortion, or a high crime or misdemeanor?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Castor, the deputy assistant to the President of the National Security, Mr. Morrison, listened in on the phone call. He testified that he was not concerned that anything discussed on the phone call was illegal or improper. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Several Democrat witnesses testified that it is fairly common for foreign aid to be paused for various reasons, including concerns that the country is corrupt and taxpayer dollars may be misspent. Ambassador Volker testified that this hold on security assistance to Ukraine was not significant. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, testified that in Ukraine, and I quote, “Corruption is not just prevalent, but frankly is the system.” Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Castor, Ukraine energy company, Burisma Holdings, had a reputation in Ukraine as a corrupt company. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	According to New York times, Hunter Biden was part of a broad effort by Burisma to bring in well connected Democrats during a period when the company was facing investigations. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Obama’s deputy assistant secretary of state, George Kent, testified that he raised concerns directly to Vice President Biden’s office about Hunter Biden’s services on Burisma’s board. Is that correct? Yes or no?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Castor, in the July 25th call, President Trump referenced Joe Biden bragging about how we stop the prosecution. We all saw that video earlier today where Joe Biden bragged about how he told Ukraine if the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Mr. Castor, is this the same prosecutor that looked into Burisma?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	In a similar scheme, Obama assistant attorney general said, and I quote, “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption plain and simple.” Mr. Castor, here is another key question.
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Given that one, Burisma had a reputation of being a corrupt company, two Obama’s own State Department was concerned about Hunter Biden serving on Burisma’s board at the same time that Vice President Biden was acting as the point person to Ukraine, and three, Obama’s assistant attorney general said in a similar scheme that there was corruption, plain and simple, do you think then it is understandable, reasonable, and acceptable for President Trump to ask the Ukrainian president to look into the Hunter Biden/Burisma potential corruption scheme?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Castor, there are four indisputable facts that will never change that prove there is no impeachable offense. There was no quid pro quo on the July 25th call. Ukraine leadership did not know the aide was held up at the time of the July 25th telephone call. Ukraine received the White House meeting, phone call, and aid, even though four, Ukraine didn’t initiate any investigations. Do you agree?
2019-12-09	Debbie Lesko	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Castor, did Mr. Turley testify in the past hearing that this impeachment inquiry has not passed Chairman Nadler’s three prong tests?
2019-12-04	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ve only been in Congress since January of this year, and on the very first day of my swearing in, a Democrat in my class called for the impeachment of the president on day one, using much more colorful language than I would ever use. Since then this committee focused on the Mueller report and the Russia collusion theory. We all sat and listened to Mr. Mueller state unequivocally that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. So that didn’t work for the Democrats. So they then changed their talking points and move to the obstruction of justice theory, that the president obstructed justice and that fizzled. Then after coordinating with chairman shift staff, a whistleblower filed a complaint based completely on hearsay and overhearing other people that weren’t on a phone call talk about a phone call between two world leaders, which led to the Intel Committee, so-called impeachment inquiry, which violated all past historical president, denied the president basic due process rights and fundamental fairness by conducting this so-called inquiry in secret.
2019-12-04	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Without the minority’s ability to call witnesses and denied the president the ability to have his lawyers cross-examined witnesses. A right afforded to President Clinton and every defendant in our justice system including rapists and murderers. The Republicans on this committee have repeatedly requested all evidence collected by the Intel Committee. As we sit here today, we still don’t have the underlying evidence that we’ve been requesting. Again, a right afforded every criminal defendant in the United States. So instead we sit here getting lectures from law professors about their opinions. Their opinions, not facts. I guess the Democrats needed a constitutional law refresher course. The Republicans don’t. Mr. Chairman, you have acknowledged, and I quote, the House’s “power of impeachment demands a rigorous level of due process.” Due process means the right to confront witnesses against you, to call your own witnesses, and to have the assistance of counsel.
2019-12-04	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Those are your words, Mr. Chairman, not mine. What are you afraid of? Let the minority call witnesses. Let the president call witnesses. Clinton alone called 14 witnesses to testify. Let the president’s counsel cross examine the whistleblower. Let the president’s counsel cross examine the Intel staff who colluded with the whistleblower. In your own words, those are the rights that should be afforded to the president. Rights every criminal defendant is afforded, even terrorists in Iraq were afforded more due process than you and the democratic majority have afforded to the president. I know because I served in Iraq and I prosecuted terrorists in Iraq and we provided terrorist Iraq more rights and due process in the central criminal court of Iraq than you and Chairman Schiff have afforded the President of the United States. No collusion, no obstruction, no quid pro quo. No evidence of bribery except opinion. No evidence of treason.
2019-12-04	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	No evidence of high crime or misdemeanors. We have a bunch of opinions from partisan Democrats who have stated from day one that they want to impeach the president and not on this theory, but on multiple other different theories. The American people are smarter in your ABCs of impeachment that you’ve had on the screen that were laid out today and it’s extremely demonstrative of your lack of evidence giving you called law professors to give their opinions and not fact witnesses to give their testimony today to be cross-examined and the rights afforded to the President of the United States.
2019-12-04	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, when can we anticipate that you will choose a date for the minority day of hearings? Mr. Chairman, I’m asking you a question. When can we anticipate that you will choose a date for the minority day of hearings?
2019-12-04	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Well then I’ll do that after my time. I yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Ratcliff.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	So are you going to recognize him after for his parliamentary inquiry after my questioning?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	I’ve never seen a more partisan spectacle than what I’ve witnessed here today. Democrats want the rules to apply when it benefits them, and not to apply when Republicans invoke them. Nine hours ago now, Mr. Burke, a hired gun for the Democrats, got 30 minutes to spread his partisan rhetoric, and then 45 minutes to cross examine witnesses. That’s 70 minutes more than most of the members of this committee, who have been elected by their districts to serve in the United States Congress. Mr. Burke is an unelected New York lawyer specifically brought in by the Democrats to give his opinion, a politically biased consultant who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal elections to the likes of ActBlue, Hillary Clinton, Obama and Biden. Mr. Burke gave over $5,000 alone to Hillary Clinton for her presidential race. No wonder why he has an ax to grind. Mr. Burke is a white collar criminal defense lawyer who brags on his website of getting New York financial brokers deferred prosecution for tax fraud, and fund managers off their insider trading charges.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	And Mr. Burke was able to say whatever he wanted to say without swearing an oath to his testimony that it would be truthful. So he can sit before this committee not as a fact witness and directly lie to the American people without any threat of criminal prosecution. Make sense? He’s a white collar criminal defense lawyer. I’m sure he didn’t want to incriminate himself.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	This is the same Mr. Burke who authored a series of reports as early as October 2017, two years ago, on his opinion as to whether President Trump obstructed justice and colluded with Russia. He also represented Mayor Bill de Blasio in a federal investigation of de Blasio’s fundraising activities.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	For my fellow Americans and Floridians watching this charade, this is who was sitting at the top of the dais, next to the chairman, acting like a member of this committee. A partisan New York Laurier with written bias against President Trump who gave thousands to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	In all of this spectacle, all of it, not a single fact witness has appeared in front of this committee. We have been denied a minority hearing day, which I asked for the last hearing. All we have had testify are partisan lawyers giving their opinions.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	So let’s talk about the facts that we do have before us. We heard from Mueller. No evidence that the Trump campaign colluded or conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. No obstruction of justice. After denying the president to call witnesses in closed door secret proceedings, and denying Republicans from calling all their witnesses in closed door proceedings, denying the President’s counsel to cross examine witnesses in intel hearings, the facts are this: Sondland stated when questioned, “Did the president tell you about any preconditions for anything?” His answer? No. For the aid to be refused? No. For a White House meeting? No. Ambassador Sondland also testified that President Trump wanted nothing from Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Tim Morrison, when questioned, “and there was no quid pro quo” answered “correct.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	The aid was released. Four facts never change. Both President Trump and President Zelensky say there was no pressure. The call transcript shows no conditionality between aid and an investigation, no quid pro quo. Ukrainians were not aware that aid was withheld when the President spoke. Ukraine didn’t open investigation, but still received aid and a meeting with President Trump.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Castor, has any committee heard from the whistleblower either in closed door hearings or an open hearings?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Did Chairman Schiff state that he would call the whistleblower to testify?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Has that happened?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Is it going to occur?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Have other countries aid also been held up?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Goldman, on October 2nd, the New York Times reported that the whistleblower, quote, “approached a House Intelligence Committee aide with his concerns about Mr. Trump.” Is that accurate?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	On October 2nd, the New York Times reported that the whistleblower approached a House Intelligence Committee aide with his concern about Mr. Trump. Is that accurate?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	No, that’s not what I’m asking. I’m asking did the whistleblower approach a House Intelligence Committee … Let me ask you a different way. Have you had any communications with the whistleblower?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	So you’re refusing to answer whether you’ve communicated with the whistleblower?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	He’s the whole basis of the beginning of this investigation. His acts absolutely relevant to this committee and to the American people.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	So as you sit here today, do you know the identity of the whistleblower?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	Because you’re also refusing to answer whether you’ve had communication-
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	That’s my time, not yours. You’re refusing to answer whether you had communications with the whistleblower. Has any other staff in the intel committee had communications with the whistleblower?
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	And you’re refusing to answer that question.
2019-12-09	Greg Steube	R-Others	Republican	And unfortunately the American people want to know those answers, and unfortunately my time has expired.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I seek recognition.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Me, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a motion pursuant to Rule 11, specifically 2K6. I move to subpoena the individual commonly referred to as the whistleblower. I asked to do this in executive session-
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, roll call vote.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m starting off today doing something that I don’t normally do and I’m going to quote speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. In March, the speaker told the Washington post, and I’m going to quote this, “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path because it divides the country.” Well, in that, the speaker and I both agree. And you know who else agrees? The founding fathers. The founding fathers recognized that crimes warranting impeachment must be so severe, regardless of political party, that there is an agreement that the actions are impeachable. But let’s go back to Speaker Pelosi’s words just one more time. The speaker says a case for impeachment must be also compelling.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Well, after last months Schiff show, this is what we learned. There is no evidence that the president directed anyone to tell the Ukrainians that aid was conditioned on investigation. Aside from the mirror presumptions by Ambassador Sondland, there is no evidence that Trump was conditioning aid on investigation. And if you doubt me, just go back to the actual transcript, because never in that call was the 2020 election mentioned and never in that call was military aid mentioned. In fact, President Trump told Senator Johnson on 31 August that aid was not conditioned on investigation. Rather, President Trump was rightfully skeptical about the Ukrainians. Their country has a history of corruption and he merely wanted the Europeans to contribute more to a problem in their own backyard. But I think we can all agree that it’s appropriate for the president, as a steward of taxpayer dollars, to ensure that our money isn’t wasted.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	I said I wasn’t going to go back to Speaker Pelosi, but I do want to go back because I forgot she also said that impeachment should be only pursued when it’s “overwhelming.” So it’s probably not good for the Democrats that none of the witnesses who testified before the intel committee were able to provide firsthand evidence of a quid pro quo. But I forgot, we’re calling it bribery now after the focus group last week. And there’s no evidence of bribery either. Instead, the two people who did have firsthand knowledge, the president and President Zelensky, both say there was no pressure on the Ukrainians.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	And again, the transcript of July 25th backs this up. And to go back to Nancy Pelosi one more time, she said that the movement for impeachment should be “bipartisan,” which is actually the same sentiment echoed by our chairman, Jerry Nadler, who in 1998 said, and I quote, “There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment supported by one of the major political parties and opposed by another.” Well, when the House voted on the Democrat’s impeachment inquiry, it was just that. The only bipartisan vote was the one imposing the inquiry. The partisan vote was the one to move forward with the inquiry. So we’re 0 for three.
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Let’s face it, this is a sham impeachment against President Trump. It’s not compelling, it’s not overwhelming, and it’s not bipartisan. So even by the speaker’s own criteria, this has failed. Rather, what this is, is nothing more than a partisan witch hunt, which denies the fundamental fairness of our American justice system and denies due process to the President of the United States. The Democrats case is based on nothing more than thoughts, feelings and conjectures and a few … the thoughts and feelings of a few unelected career bureaucrats, and the American people are absolutely fed up. Instead of wasting our time on this, we should be doing things like passing USMCA, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and working on our failing infrastructure in this country. With that said, Mr. Turley, I’ve watched as your words had been twisted and mangled all day long. Is there anything that you would like to clarify?
2019-12-04	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. In the Navy, we had a saying. BLUF, which is bottom line up front. Let me give everybody the bottom line. We’re here because Democrats are terrified that President Trump is going to win re-election. That’s really what this all comes down to. Let me get into the specifics. We’re here dealing with impeachment because Democrats don’t want to talk about the red hot Trump economy. They don’t want to talk about the fact that we have the lowest unemployment rates in 50 years. We’re dealing with impeachment because Democrats don’t want to talk about how the President has worked to protect American companies from Chinese aggression. How he’s renegotiated trade deals to benefit American workers, how he’s eliminated burdensome regulations that hurt the economy and that help job creators.
2019-12-09	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	Congressional Democrats don’t want to be reminded that the American people, that the Democrat agenda includes such laughable ideas like banning airplanes, giving illegal immigrants taxpayer-funded healthcare, and taking private health insurance away from the American people. That’s really why we’re here. This whole process is just a distraction. It’s an attempt to hide the far-left radical agenda. So let’s talk about the facts. Schiff’s report claims the administration froze military aid for Ukraine without explanation. Yet the facts are that Trump gave more military aid to Ukraine than President Obama. President Obama gave Ukraine well wishes and blankets. President Trump gave the Ukrainians Javelin missiles. That’s the difference, and those are the facts. Let’s go over some more facts. House Democrats want to claim it’s a conspiracy that Ukrainian officials attempted to interfere with the 2016 election. Yet Ukrainian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election are well documented by Politico, by Financial Times, and The Hill.
2019-12-09	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	There was an attempt to influence our elections, and that’s troubling and that’s why President Trump brought it to attention of President Zelensky. Again, those are the facts. But at the end of the day, those facts don’t seem to matter to my Democrat colleagues. House Democrats don’t care that President Zelensky has repeatedly said there was no pressure. It’s not important that the call transcript was the best evidence we have. It is the best evidence we have, it’s the actual primary document. And that transcript shows there was no quid pro quo, no bribery. I got to remember we’re calling it bribery after an old Latin phrase didn’t poll well or test well in a Democrat focus group.
2019-12-09	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	My Democrat colleagues seem to really care about focus groups and polling. Unfortunately, again they don’t care about the facts, because the fact is that Democrats were calling for impeachment before this investigation even began. Representative Tlaib said in January, I don’t even think we were sworn in yet. She said in January, “Impeach the mother.” Representative Green said in May, and I quote, “I’m concerned that if we don’t impeach this President, he will get re-elected.” These proceedings, this entire process is nothing more than a political hit job. Well, unlike my Democrat colleagues, I actually do care about the facts, which is why I’m troubled that our committee did not hear from a single fact witness this entire time. We should be hearing from Hunter Biden. We should be hearing from Schiff’s staff. We know that Schiff’s staff coordinated with the whistleblower.
2019-12-09	Guy Reschenthal	R-Others	Republican	And again, we need to hear from the whistleblower. Last week, I offered a motion to subpoena the whistleblower to testify in executive session, meaning that he or she could testify behind closed doors. My Democrat colleagues voted my motion down in a partisan fashion. Mr. Castor, can you walk us through the inaccuracies in the whistleblower’s complaint?
2019-12-04	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, how am I recorded?
2019-12-04	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I’m a veteran of impeachments. I’ve been named by the house is an impeachment manager in four impeachments, Clinton and three judges; that’s more than anybody else in history. And one of the things in every impeachment, whether it’s the ones that I was involved in or others that have come before the committee where I was not a manager, is a debate on what is a high crime and misdemeanor and how serious does that have to be in order for it to rise to a level of an impeachable offense. About 50 years ago, then Republican leader, Gerald Ford, made a comment that saying a high crime and misdemeanor is anything in majority of the house of representatives deems it to be on any given day. I don’t agree with that."
2019-12-04	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	That sits either a very low bar or non-existent bar, and it certainly would make the presidents serve at the pleasure of the house, which was not what the framers intended… When they rejected the British form of parliamentary democracy, where the prime minister and the government could be overthrown by a mere vote of no confidence in the House of Commons. So, I am looking at what we’re facing here. This whole inquiry was started out by a comment that president Trump made the president Zelensky, in the July 25th call of, “Do me a favor.” There are some who have said it’s a quid pro quo, there are some who have implied that it’s a quid pro quo that both Trump and Zelensky have said it wasn’t, and Zelensky has said, “There was no pressure on me,” and, “The aid came through within six weeks after the phone call in question was made.
2019-12-04	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Now you can contrast that to where there was no impeachment inquiry to vice president Biden. When he was giving a speech and said, “You know, I held up $1 billion worth of aid unless the prosecutor was fired within six hours. And son of a bleep, that’s what happened.” Now, it seems to me that if you’re for a quid pro quo and looking for something that was really over the top, it was not saying, “Do me a favor.” It was saying, “Son of a bleep, that’s what happened in six hours.” Now, the Republicans who are in charge of Congress at the time Biden made that comment, we did not tie the country up for three months, and going on four now, wrapping everybody in this town around the axle rod. We continued attempting to do the public’s business. That’s not what’s happening here.
2019-12-04	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	And I think the American public are getting a little bit sick and tired of impeachment, impeachment, impeachment. When they know that less than a year from now, they will be able to determine whether Donald Trump stays in office or somebody else will be elected. And I take this responsibility extremely seriously. It is an awesome and very grave responsibility, and it is not one that should be done lightly, it is not one that should be done quickly, and it is not one without examining all of the evidence, which is what was done in the Nixon impeachment and what was done largely by Kenneth Starr in the Clinton impeachment. Now I’d like to ask you, professor Turley, because your mind is the only one of the four, who up there, that doesn’t seem to have it made up before you walk into the door. Isn’t there a difference between saying, “Do me a favor,” and, “Son of a bleep, that’s what happened in six hours time.
2019-12-04	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Thank you.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I object to the question that requests opinion-
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	I object to the question. Rule on whether the question is in order or not.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Why?
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Point of order. He’s entitled to answer the question fully, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	The point of order is the gentleman from Florida is complain that he can’t see what the questioner is relying on and would like to see if and-
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Only half of it was read to him.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Now let’s slow down a bit here.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Let’s slow down a bit here so that members are able to fully see what is being put in in support of what you’re trying to do. We can’t do that without being able to see it or read it.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Gaetz has said that. Now, let’s slow down so that we can see or hear what he is referring to. And you’re not letting that happen. And that goes to the privileges of the members and you are asking to sit in on this meeting and the vote.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman I make the point of order that he’s badgering the witness.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman can you rule on my point of order that he’s badgering the witness because he’s doing that.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	A point of order the committee is not in order and the chairman is not in order.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Well, would you rule on my original point of order?
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	The lawyer is badgering the witness. We have to have some decorum in here and you have your rules of decorum, which aren’t comporting with everybody else’s rules of decorum.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	It is if it’s by another witness.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to follow up on the two series of questions that the ranking member Mr. Collins directed at Mr. Goldman relative to the telephone company subpoenas and the inclusion of certain information in the majority report from the Intelligence Committee. Let me say that there are two issues involved. One that is not involved is the legality of the subpoena. I believe that that was a subpoena that is fully authorized under the law and under congressional procedures. Where I do have a problem and a really big problem, however, is the fact that somebody made a decision to match certain data, mega data, meta-data that had been collected through the subpoena with phone numbers of journalists and members of Congress.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	And that is the beginning of a surveillance state, which I think is outrageous, particularly since with the Freedom Act in 2013 we curtail the NSA’s ability about that. Now had chairman Schiff decided to man up and come here and talk rather than hiding behind Mr. Goldman, his chief investigator, as his surrogate or lead gate, if you will, I think we could have gotten to the bottom of this and we could have taken action to make sure that this never happens again. I do not want to see members of Congress through their subpoena power being able to subpoena the telephone records of private citizens Willy nilly without any kind of cause or to match the numbers up with somebody else to see who they were talking to.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	And then going the next step and publishing the results of that match in a report that the minority hadn’t seen until it was released. That I think is an abuse of power. We’re talking a lot about abuses of power here in the White House and in the executive branch. Here, we see a clear abuse of power on the part of the people who are prosecuting this impeachment against the president of the United States. They should be ashamed of themselves. Now I come from the state where Joe McCarthy came from. I met Joe McCarthy twice when I was first getting into politics as a teenager.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Folks, you have made Joe McCarthy look like a piker with what you’ve done with the electronic surveillance involved. It is something that has to be put a stop to now. It is something that has to be fessed up to now. Whether it’s you, Mr. Goldman, that authorized the matching and the publication or whether it was Chairman Schiff. I would’ve loved to put Chairman Schiff under oath so that he could be required to answer the same way you have, Mr. Golden, on how this all happened. But as one who has spent quite a bit of time curtailing the excesses of the Patriot Act, which I authored, with the Freedom Act, which I all also authored, the surveillance state can get out of control.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	This is a major step in the surveillance state getting out of control in the hands of the Congress and in the hands of a majority party that wants to influence political decisions relative to politicians, in this case President Donald Trump that they don’t like and they haven’t liked him from the beginning of his term. They have tried to talk about impeachment since the beginning of his term. They thought that the Mueller report was going to be the smoking gun. It ended up being a cap pistol, now they’re working on this.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	And the steps that they have gone, the violation of common sense, the precedent that they have started and looking at the way the chairman has conducted this hearing today and in the previous hearings, not even to allow Mr. Gaetz To make a point of order that he can’t see what you put on the screen, I think goes against the entire fabric of American democracy. Shame on those who have done it. And if we want to get back to something objective, maybe it’s time to push the recess button. I yield back.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I yielded back.
2019-12-09	Jim Sesenbrenne	R-Others	Republican	I didn’t ask him a question. I made a statement.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. You know, all day long we’ve been sitting here and listening to my friends across the aisle and their witnesses claim that the president demanded Ukraine do us a favor by assisting in 2020 reelection campaign before he would release the military aid. This is like everything else in the sham impeachment, purposefully misleading and not based on the facts. So let’s review the actual transcript of the call. They never mentioned the 2020 election. They never mentioned military aid. It does, however, clearly show that the favor the president requested was assistance with the ongoing investigation into the 2016 election.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Those investigations, particularly the one being run by U.S. Attorney Jeff Durham, should concern Democrats. And the transcript of this call shows that the president was worried about the efforts of Ukraine relating to the 2016 election. We know this, and notice I’m using the word know and not the word infer, from reading the transcript and because he spoke about it ending with Mueller.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	We know this because he wants the attorney general to get in touch with the Ukrainians about the issue. We have a trade deal with Ukraine governing these sorts of international investigations. But like so many other things, these facts are inconvenient for Democrats. They don’t fit the impeachment narrative so they’re misrepresented or ignored. And I think it’s important when we talk about this and whatever the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, clear and convincing evidence, whether it’s a judicial hearing, a quasi-judicial hearing or a Congressional hearing, when we are talking about this issues, I think we need to start with how we look at it.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And I’m not a Constitutional law professor, I’m just an old criminal defense attorney. But when I walk into a courtroom, I think of three things. What’s the crime charge, what’s the conduct, and who’s the victim? And we’ve managed to make it till five o’clock today before we’ve talked about the alleged victim of the crime and that’s President Zelensky. And three different times President Zelensky, at least three different times, has denied being pressured by the president.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	The call shows laughter, pleasantries, cordiality. September 25th, President Zelensky states, “No, you heard that we had a good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things. I think you read it and nobody pushed me.” October 10th, President Zelensky had a press conference and I encourage everybody to watch it. Even if you don’t understand it, 90% of communication’s nonverbal. You tell me if you think he’s lying. There was no blackmail.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	December 2nd, this Monday. ” I never talked to the president from the position of quid pro quo.” So we have the alleged victim of quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, whatever we’re dealing with now today, repeatedly and adamantly shouting from the rooftops that he never felt pressure, that he was not the victim of anything. So in order for this whole thing to stick, we have to believe that President Zelensky is a pathological liar, or that the Ukrainian president and the country are so weak that he has no choice but to parade himself out there, demoralize himself for the good of his country.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Either of these two assertions weakens their countries and harms our efforts to help the Ukraine and also begs the question of how on earth did President Zelensky withstand this illegal and impeachable pressure to begin with? Because this fact still has not changed. The aid was released to Ukraine and did not take any action from them in order for it to flow. And with that I yield to my friend, Mr. Jordan.
2019-12-04	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	The action from them in order for it to flow and with that I yield to my friend Mr. Jordan.
2019-12-09	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Consent requests before we start.
2019-12-09	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	I would request that we enter into the record the FISA applications and other aspects of the FBI’s crossfire hurricane …
2019-12-09	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	I think if we’re going to …
2019-12-09	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	The FISA report that just came out.
2019-12-09	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	The Inspector General’s report, the [inaudible 00:00:24] this whole thing.
2019-12-09	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Castor, it’s been a long day. It’s been a long-
2019-12-09	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And Mr. Castor, it’s been a long day. Been a long couple months. You’ve been in the middle of this and I know previously you wanted to say something.
2019-12-09	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	You’ve worked hard and you deserve it. I just want to end it and summarize with this: that because you cannot prove a crime. And chairman went on TV yesterday and said they’d get a conviction in three minutes, but my question is for what crime? The Mueller conspiracy fell flat. The obstruction charge was abandoned when the public hearing was over. Campaign finance is a nonstarter. The victim of conspiracy or the victim of bribery and extortion says he’s not a victim. Because you can’t prove any of it, does not mean you can use all of it. And that’s no way to prosecute a case and it is no way to proceed with impeachment. Thank you.
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Did you say whistleblower like Colonel Vindman? I don’t think that’s a fact that’s in evidence.
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, I’m sorry. And all due respect Congressman. I believe you just said a whistleblower like Colonel Vindman.
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	That’s not in evidence.
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	I think we had some discussion that, you know, Mr. Giuliani was promoting a negative narrative about the Ukraine and certain officials were trying to help the President understand that with Zelensky, it was a new day and Ukraine is going to be different. Is that your understanding?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And to the extent that you’re aware of what Ambassador, you know, Sondland’s goals were here and Ambassador Volker’s goals were here, you think they were just trying to do the best they could and try to advocate in the best interest of the United States?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And so to the extent Mr. Giuliani may have had differing views, they were trying to help him understand that it was time to change those views?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And you never conferred with Mr. Giuliani?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	You never had any meetings, phone calls, or anything of that sort?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And did you have any-
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	America’s mayor.
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	I want to move now to that July 10th meeting that you referenced Colonel Vindman. What exactly did Ambassador Sondland say when the Ukrainian officials raised the idea of a white house meeting?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And what happened-
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	What happened to the broader meeting after he made that reference?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Did you have any conversations with Ambassador Bolton about this meeting?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Did you follow Ambassador Sondland and the others to the ward room for a meeting follow up?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Were the investigations, the specific investigations that Ambassador Sondland referenced in the larger meeting also discussed in the ward room meeting?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And what did Ambassador Sondland say?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	How did you respond, if at all?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Was Ambassador Volker in this meeting as well?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Was this statement made in front of the Ukrainian officials?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	The senior White House Staff you’re referring to, does that include Fiona Hill, your immediate supervisor at the time?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Now you said you also reported this incident to the NSC lawyers, is that right?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And what was their response?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	Why did you report this meeting and this conversation to the NSC lawyers?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	So am I correct Colonel Vindman that at least no later than that July 10th meeting, the Ukrainians had understood, or at least heard that the Oval Office meeting that they so desperately wanted was conditioned on these specific investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election?
0201-11-19	Kelly Armstrong	R-Others	Republican	And directly linking the White House meeting to the investigations?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Professor Turley. I want to direct these first few questions to you. The other three witnesses have identified this amorphous standard for impeaching a president. They’ve said that if a president abuses his power for personal or political gain, it’s impeachable conduct. You agree with me?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	I got a long ways to go here.
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Okay?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	So, let me go with a few examples and see if you agree with me.
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Lyndon Johnson directed the Central Intelligence Agency to place a spy in Barry Goldwater’s campaign. That spy got advanced copies of speeches and other strategy, deliver that to the Johnson campaign. Would that be impeachable conduct according to the other panelists?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	How about when President Johnson put a wire tap on Goldwater’s campaign plane? Would that be for political benefit?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Okay, well I’m going to go with a few other presidents. We’ll see where we go. Congressman Deutch just informed us that FDR put country first. Now, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he was president, directed the IRS to conduct audits of his political enemies, namely Huey Long, William Randolph Hearst, Hamilton Fish, Father Coughlin. Would that be an abuse of power for political benefit according to the other panelists? Would that be impeachable conduct?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	How about when president Kennedy directed his brother, Robert Kennedy, to deport one of his mistresses as an East German spy? Would that qualify as impeachable conduct?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And how about when he directed the FBI to use wire taps on congressional staffers who opposed him politically? Would that be impeachable conduct?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And, let’s go to Barack Obama. When Barack Obama directed… Or made a finding that the Senate was in recess and appointed people to the National Labor Relations Board and lost nine to zero, Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted against the president on this issue, would that be an abuse of power?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Okay, and how about when the president directed his national security advisor and the Secretary of State to lie to the American people about whether the ambassador to Libya was murdered as a result of a video or was murdered as a result of a terrorist act, would that be an abusive power for political benefit 17 days before the next election?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Well, you’ve heard their definition. You can apply those facts to their definition.
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	How about when Abraham Lincoln arrested legislators in Maryland so that they wouldn’t convene to secede from the Union, and Virginia already had seceded, so it would have placed Washington, DC, the nation’s Capitol in the middle of the rebellion. Would that have been an abuse of power for political benefit?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And you mentioned George Washington a little while ago as perhaps having met the standard of impeachment for your other panelists. In fact, let me ask you something, Professor Turley, can you name a single president in the history of the United States, save President Harrison, who died 32 days after his inauguration that would not have met the standard of impeachment for our friends here?
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Isn’t what you and I and many others are afraid of is that the standard that your friends, to the right of you, and not politically, but to the right of you sitting in there, that your friends have decided that the bar is so low that when we have a Democrat president in office and a Republican house and a Republican Senate, we’re going to be going through this whole scenario again in a way that really puts the country at risk.
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Now isn’t the difference, Professor Turley, that some people live in an ivory tower and some people live in a swamp, and those of us that are in the swamp are doing our very best for the American people, but it’s not pretty.
2019-12-04	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	I yield back.
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Castor, I want to direct your attention to page three of the telephone call dated July 25th between President Trump and President Zelensky. On page three, President Trump states, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.” Later he says, “I would like to have the Attorney General call you, or your people, and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	The majority report, on page 13, says the US intelligence community had unanimously determined that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election to help the candidacy of President Trump. Mr Castor, it appears to be a conflict there. President Trump is asking the Ukraine to investigate something the majority has decided that it’s an illegitimate request, because there was no interference in an election by the Ukraine. Is that how you read this?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And the press release from the majority, on their report says, “As part of this scheme, President Trump, acting in his official capacity, and using his position of public trust, personally and directly requested that the President of Ukraine, that the government of Ukraine publicly announce investigations into subsection two, a baseless theory promoted by Russia, alleging that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 US election. Is that true?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And Mr. Castor, I want to ask you something. Have you seen this article from Politico dated January 11, 2017?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And the title of that article is Ukrainian Efforts To Sabotage Trump Backfire. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	I want to read you the second paragraph. “Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide and corruption, and suggested they were investigating the matter only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisors. A political investigation found.” Isn’t it true that President Trump had a legitimate reason to request help from the Ukraine about the 2016 election? And I’m not suggesting for a minute that Russia didn’t interfere, of course they interfered. But the Ukraine officials tried to influence the election.
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Let’s move on to Ambassador Sondland. I only have 10 fingers and 10 toes, so I can’t count above 20, Mr. Castor. But you know how many times ambassador Sondland said that he did not know, did not recall, had no recollection, had limited memory, or failed to remember something in his October 17th testimony? You know how many times? 325. Does that surprise you? 325.
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And then he files a clarifying statement, and he clarifies a few things I guess. But did you have any influence? Do you have any contact with Ambassador Sondland between the time of his deposition and the time of his clarifying statement?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Did the majority?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	You have no idea? So they may have had influence on his testimony?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And that would be evidence of bias. That would be evidence of credibility. That would be evidence that we should take into account before, but we’ll never know will we? Because the Majority Counsel has a right to assert a privilege, as to information that’s relevant to this committee’s decision. The Majority Council has a right to assert a privilege in any communications he has with the Chairman, Adam Schiff, doesn’t he?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	As does Minority Council. That’s a privilege that we reserved here in Congress, isn’t it?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	And the same thing is true of FOIA, the Freedom Of Information Act, does not apply to memos the Majority Council writes. Isn’t that true?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	So we’ve demanded that of the executive branch, but we have allowed ourselves not to be part of FOIA, correct?
2019-12-09	Ken Buck	R-Others	Republican	Okay. So the majority has a privilege. The President also has a privilege, it’s called executive privilege. He can meet with the Secretary Of State, and that’s a privileged conversation. He can meet with the Secretary Of Defense, that’s a privileged conversation. He can meet with the Secretary Of Energy, that’s a privilege conversation. Now when the majority has subpoenaed those witnesses, and the President has refused to produce those witnesses or relevant documents, or what they consider relevant documents, they are charging him with an article of impeachment for obstruction. In fact, their report says, “President obstructed the impeachment inquiry by instructing witnesses to ignore subpoenas.” Why?
2019-12-04	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Thank you. I’m afraid this hearing is indicative of the indecency to which we’d come. When instead of the committee of jurisdiction bringing in witnesses to get to the bottom of what happened, and not even having time to review the report, which, as professor Turley indicated, is wafer thin when compared to the 36 boxes of documents that were delivered to the last impeachment group. But… Then to start this hearing with the chairman of the committee saying that the facts are undisputed. The only thing that is disputed more than the facts in this case is the statement that the facts are undisputed. They are absolutely disputed and the evidence is a bunch of hearsay on hearsay, that if anybody here had tried cases before of enough magnitude, you would know you can’t rely on hearsay on hearsay, but we have experts who know better than the accumulated experience of the ages.
2019-12-04	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	"So, here we are, and I would submit we need some factual witnesses. We do not need to receive a report that we don’t have a chance to read before this hearing. We need a chance to bring in actual fact witnesses; and there are a couple I can name that are critical to us getting to the bottom. They worked for the national security council, Abigail Grace, Sean Misko, that were involved in the US Ukraine affairs, and they worked with vice president Biden on different matters involving the Ukraine. They worked with Brennan Masters. They have absolutely critical information about certain Ukrainians involvement in our US election. Their relationships with the witnesses, who went before the intel committee and others involved in these allegations, make them the most critical witnesses in this entire investigation. And their records, including their emails or text messages, their flash drives or computers, have information that will bring this effort to remove the president to a screeching halt."
2019-12-04	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	So we have an article here from October 11, Kerry Picket points out that house intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff recruited two former national security council aides who worked alongside the CIA whistleblower at the NSC during the Obama and Trump administrations. Abigail Grace, who worked at the NSC until 2018, was hired in February, while Sean Misko, NSCA until 2017, joined Schiff’s committee in August, the same month the whistleblower submitted his complaint. And goes on to point out that Grace was hired to help shifts committee investigate the Trump White House. That month, Trump accused Schiff of stealing people who were working at the White House, and chairman Schiff said, “If the president’s worried about our hiring any former administration people, maybe you should work on being a better employer.” No, he should have fired everybody just like bill Clinton did all the US attorneys on the same day. That would have saved us a lot of what’s going on here.
2019-12-04	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	"So, anyway, we need those two witnesses; they’re critical. And then we also need someone who was a CIA detail aid of the Ukraine, NSC desk. State department [inaudible 00:24:55] shows that he was at an Italy state luncheon, there’s Italy ramifications in the last elections. He speaks Arabic and Russian, reported directly to Charles Kupchan, “who’s a friend of the Clinton’s aid,” said Blumenthal. He did policy work for Ukraine corruption. Close continuous contact with the FBI state Ukrainian officials, had a collateral duty to support vice president Biden; and Biden was Obama’s point man on Ukraine. He was associated with DNC operative Allie Chalupa, who we also need. Met with her November 9th, 2015 with Ukrainian delegation. And there’s all kinds of reasons we need these three witnesses and I would ask pursuant to section four, house resolution 660, ask our ranking member to submit the requests for these three witnesses, because we’re not having a factual hearing until we have these people that are at the bottom of every fact of this investigation."
2019-12-04	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	I yield back. [crosstalk 00:26:11] Thanks for bringing down the gavel hard. That was nice.
2019-12-04	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Yes, Mr. Chairman. I would ask unanimous consent to all for article by Daniel Hough.
2019-12-04	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Thank you.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	We’ve been told that counsel for the Democrats was a witness, and that’s why he didn’t have to comport with the rules of decorum. And now he’s sitting up here-
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	I’ve been a judge, and I know that you don’t get to be a witness and a judge in the same case. That’s my point of order. He should not be up here.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	We’re going to ignore the rules and allow [crosstalk 00:52:33] witnesses to ask the questions, then-
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	… how many other rules are you just going to disregard?
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	How about a point of order [crosstalk 00:52:45]? This is not appropriate to have a witness be a questioner of somebody that [crosstalk 00:52:51] was a witness when he was.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	It’s just wrong.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Well, I made a point of order, and you won’t rule on it.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	There is no rule nor precedent for anybody being a witness, and then getting to come up-
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	… and question. And so-
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	The point of order is he’s inappropriate to be up here asking questions.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	How much money do you have to give to get to do that?
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	It was a legitimate question.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Will this witness be able to cross examine Mr. Berke like he’s being able to cross examine the opposing witness?
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	That a point of inquiry.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Well I had some questions for the witness, Mr. Burke, but he is absconded, so I’m going to use my five minutes but not to ask questions. It is interesting though to have heard Mr. Goldman refuse to answer question about the investigation, yet he comes in here and the very reason that he wants to see the president for the first time any president’s ever been removed from office, why he’s been obstructing, he didn’t answer our questions. So perhaps if we’re going to apply his sense of justice to him, it would be time to have him removed from his position.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	But that’s only if we apply his own standards. And as [inaudible 00:22:01] says if it weren’t for double standards, some of these folks wouldn’t have standards at all. But we were told also at the beginning that we would hear lawyers present evidence. Lawyers are going to come in here. Now what normally happens, and I’ve been in some kangaroo hearings and courts, not my own when I was there, but I have been mistreated in hearings before, but I have never seen anything like this where we don’t allow the fact witnesses to come in here.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	We have the lawyers come in and tell us what we’re supposed to know about those witnesses and about their testimony and about their impression and what the law is. This is outrageous. My friend Jim Sensenbrenner said in 41 years, he’s never seen anything like what we have going on here to try to oust a sitting president. And it’s also outrageous to hear people say, well, this man thought he was a king because he said he could do anything he wanted when they know that that statement was in the context of whether or not he could fire Mueller.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	And of course he could fire Mueller, he could fire or not fire Mueller. He could appoint a special prosecutor to invest my Mueller and Weissmann. I think he should have, but that’s his prerogative and he could’ve done anything about that he wanted. To take that out of context, he thinks he’s a king. Let me tell you what a king is. A king is someone who says over 20 times I can’t do that. Congress has to change the law on immigration. And then he decides, you know what, I got a pen and I got a phone. I’ll do whatever I want and by golly he does.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	He makes new law with a pen and a phone. Now that is more like a monarchy, not somebody saying they can fire a special prosecutor if they want to. And regarding treason, The Constitution itself says you got to have two witnesses and that’s not hearsay witnesses. None of this stuff that wouldn’t be admissible in any decent court. No. That’s two direct evidence witnesses that can come in and positively identified themselves, not something they overheard or something, but actually be witnesses to treason. And yet this group comes in here, they toss treason out in a report like it’s no big deal.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	We can bring in a bunch of hearsay witnesses and then we’ll have the lawyers testify and then throw a president out of office. This is so absurd. It’s so absurd. Now we have a witness come in and we’re told he’s going to be a witness. That’s why he doesn’t have to follow under the rules of decorum. And then I’ve never seen this. He gets to come up and grill his opposing adversary witness. I feel like to be fair, if we were going to make this thing fair, Mr. Castor would be able to come up and grill Mr. Burke. But this isn’t about being fair. It’s not about due process.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	This is about a kangaroo system. And let me tell you, those that think you’ve done something special here. You have set the bar so low, I’m afraid it’s irreparable. I mean, just think we’ve had people already mention the next president Joe Biden. We’re told, gee, he may be the next president. Well, we’ve already got the forms. All we have to do is eliminate Donald Trump’s name and put Joe Biden’s name in there because he’s on video, he and his son. He basically has admitted to the crime that’s being hoisted on the president improperly. So I’m scared for my country because I’ve never seen anything like this.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	This is supposed to be the Congress. I came up here from a court where we had order and we had rules and I’ve seen nothing of the kind in here today. And it’s outrageous that we’re trying to remove a president with a kangaroo court like this. I yield back
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Yeah, and it is mentioned in the report we got. Thank you very much.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I have-
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	… unanimous consent.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	And I ask you now that’s consented that you report by the majority staff of the house committee on the judiciary constitutional grounds for Presidential impeachment. It talks about treason and bribery be admitted for the record.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Be made part of our record.
2019-12-09	Louie Gohmert	R-Others	Republican	Thanks.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	We’re fighting all the subpoenas.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Then I have in Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Very quickly, Professor Turley, would you like to respond?
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	So this leads to my statement that I’d like to make. Of course, the United States House of Representatives has initiated impeachment inquiries against the president of the United States only three times in our nation’s history, prior to this one.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Those impeachment inquiries were done in this committee, the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment matters. Here, in 2019, under this inquiry, fact witnesses that have been called were in front of the intelligence committee. We have been given no indication that this committee will conduct substantive hearings with fact witnesses. As a member serving on the judiciary committee, I can say that the process in which we are participating is insufficient, unprecedented and grossly inadequate.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Sitting before us is a panel of witnesses containing four distinguished law professors from some of our country’s finest educational institutions. I do not doubt that each of you are extremely well versed in the subject of constitutional law, and yes, there is precedent for similar panels in the aforementioned history, but only after specific charges had been made known and the underlying facts presented in full due to an exhaustive investigation.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	However, I don’t understand why we are holding this hearing at this time with these witnesses. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have admitted they don’t know what articles of impeachment they will consider. How does anyone expect a panel of law professors to weigh in on the legal grounds for impeachment charges prior to even knowing what the charges brought by this committee are going to be?
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Some of my Democrat colleagues have stated over and over that impeachment should be a nonpartisan process, and I agree. One of my colleagues in the Democratic Party stated, and I quote, “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there is something so compelling and overwhelming and bi-partisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	My democratic colleagues have stated numerous times that they are on a truth seeking and fact finding mission. Another one of my democratic colleagues said, and I quote, “We have a responsibility to consider the facts that emerged squarely and with the best interest of our country, not our party and our hearts.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	These types of historic proceedings, regardless of political beliefs, ought to be about fact finding and truth seeking, but that is not what this has turned out to be. Again, no disrespect to these witnesses, but for all I know this is the only hearing that we will have, and none of them are fact witnesses.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	My colleagues are saying one thing and doing something completely different. No member of Congress can look their constituents in the eye and say this is a comprehensive, fact finding, truth seeking mission. Ranking member Collins and members of the minority on this committee have written six letters over the past month to Chairman Nadler asking for procedural fairness for all the underlying evidence to be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee to expand the number of witnesses, and have an even more bipartisan panel here today, and for clarity on today’s impeachment proceedings, since we haven’t received evidence to review.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	The minority has yet to receive a response to these letters. Right here today is another very clear example for all Americans to truly understand the ongoing lack of transparency and openness with these proceedings. The witness list for the for this hearing was not released until late Monday afternoon. Opening statements from the witnesses today were not distributed until late last night, and the Intelligence Committee’s finalized report has yet to be presented to this committee.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	You hear from those in the majority that process is a Republican talking point, when in reality it is an American talking point. Process is essential to the institution. A thoughtful, meaningful process of this magnitude with such great implications should be demanded by the American people. With that, I yield back.
2019-12-04	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	… the American people. With that, I yield back.
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Then I have an article to, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they’d start a major investigation into the Bidens’. It’s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens’.
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	I’m actually stunned by the process or lack thereof that is taking place in this institution. I have many democratic friends that I know to be thoughtful, deliberative members of Congress, even though we may disagree vehemently on policy, but these proceedings being led by the majority, like I said, it’s stunning. I cannot for the life of me, figure out why the majority would approach this in such a way that will forever cast doubt on why and how they chose to affect history with the impeachment of a president of the United States.
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Now, to what is taking place here today. This is just bizarre. As a member of Congress serving on the house judiciary committee, I’m asking questions to staff his witnesses before us in an impeachment evidentiary hearing. I mean, no disrespect to staff. We have the most dedicated, hardworking staff and without these individuals, we most certainly couldn’t do our jobs effectively, but we have not and we will not hear from any fact witnesses. Whether you identify as a Republican, a Democrat or an independent, whether you agree or disagree with the president, whether you like or dislike a president.
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	The American people should feel cheated, by the way, this is all taking place. This process is more than incomplete and the American people deserve better. Today history is being made and I too believe it is a dangerous precident for the future of our Republic. It is worth a deeper explanation of the issue of a minority hearing. The minority members of this committee have frequently asked the chairman for a minority day hearing and all members on this side have signed onto a letter to the chairman asking for a minority day hearing.
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	I’d like to quote house rule 11 clause two whenever a hearing is conducted by committee on a measure or a matter, the minority members of the committee shall be entitled upon the request to the chair by majority of them before the completion of the hearing to call witnesses selected by the minority to testify with respect to that measure or matter during at least one day of hearing there on. The wording here is that the minority shall be entitled, not if the chairman deems the minority worthy, but shall be entitled.
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Castor with all of your experience in investigations here in the Congress, is it your belief based on that experience that ignoring the minority’s stated rights for a hearing under the rules of the house severely undermines the future of this institution?
2019-12-09	Martha Roby	R-Others	Republican	I like to quote what we heard from the democratic staff, Mr. Burke in his opening comments, it is the hope that in these discussions we can put aside political rancor, disagreements, and have a fair discussion. That is far from what has happened here today or the days leading up to this. The American people deserve better than this and I yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Collins.
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Kent, Ambassador Taylor. Thank you for your service. I have a great deal of appreciation for your profession. You have very little direct contact with decision makers, a tremendous amount of responsibility. And not a lot of authority to affect U.S. policy, bilateral engagements or multilateral engagements, you’re trying to shepherd through issues with our allies.
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	One example of that, Ambassador Taylor, is that you who testified in your prior testimony that you have not had any contact with the President of the United States. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Taylor, Mr. Kent, have you had any contact with President of the United States?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	So not only, no conversations with the President of the United States about Ukraine. You’ve not had any contact with the President of the United States, correct?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Okay, so you both know that this impeachment inquiry is about the President of the United States, don’t you? I mean, the man that neither one of you have had any contact with, you’re the first up witnesses. I just find that a little amazing, that the first up, would be two people who have never had any contact with the President himself.
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Now, Kurt Volker did have contact with the President, and contact with President on Ukraine. Mr., Ambassador Taylor, you said that he’s a man of highest integrity. Well, I know Kurt Volker, and I know he served as the NATO ambassador. He served as the Director of the McCain Institute. He’s of the highest professional ethics, one of the most knowledgeable people about Europe. He’s absolutely a truthful man. Mr. Kent, would you agree with Ambassador Taylor, that he’s of the highest integrity?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Do either of you have any evidence that Mr. Volker committed perjury, or lied to this Committee in his testimony to this committee? Do either of you have any evidence that Kurt Volker perjured himself, or lied to this Committee, in his testimony? Ambassador Taylor, any evidence?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	But you have no evidence that he lied or perjured himself, correct, Mr. Kent?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Great. Well, we’re not in a court, gentlemen, and if we were, the Sixth Amendment would apply, and so would rules on hearsay and opinion. And most of your two testimonies would not be admissible, whatsoever. But I understand, in your profession, you deal in words of understanding. Words of beliefs and feelings, because in your profession, that’s what you work with to try to pull together policy, and to go in and out of meetings to try to formulate opinions that affect other people’s decision making.
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Ambassador Taylor, have you ever prepared for a meeting with a President or a Prime Minister of a country, where you were told one thing before you went into the meeting as to what it was to be about, and the meeting be about another thing? Or you get in there, and the beliefs or opinions of the President or the Prime Minister, were other than you believed?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Right, have you ever walked in with a belief that you thought about the country that you were serving in, and find out that they were wrong?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Well, Ambassador Taylor, the reason why the Sixth Amendment doesn’t allow hearsay, is because it’s unreliable. It’s unreliable because frequently, it’s untruthful. It is not factual. It might be beliefs or understandings. Ambassador, you testified about a number of things that you heard. Isn’t it true, possible, that the things that you heard were not true? That some of the beliefs and understandings that you had, are not accurate? That in fact, you’re mistaken about some of the things that you testified today, on a factual basis, versus a professional assessment?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	But since you learned it from others, you could-
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	… you could be right, you could be wrong, right-
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	… Mr. Taylor?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	But since you learned it from others, you could be wrong. Correct?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	And they could be wrong, or they could be mistaken, or they could have heard it incorrectly. Right, Ambassador Taylor?
2019-11-13	Michael Turner	R-Others	Republican	Right. So you could be wrong.
2019-12-04	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s pretty clear to me that no matter what questions we ask these four witnesses here today, and no matter what their answers are, that most, if not all, of the democrats on this committee are going to vote to impeach president Trump. That’s what their hardcore Trump hating based wants and they’ve wanted that since the president was elected three years ago. In fact, when democrats took over the house, one of the first things that they did was introduce articles of impeachment against president Trump, and that was way before president Trump and the Ukrainian president Zelensky ever had their famous phone call, whether it was perfect or not.
2019-12-04	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Excuse me. I’m sorry.
2019-12-04	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Now today, we’re undertaking a largely academic exercise instead of hearing from fact witnesses like Adam Schiff or Hunter Biden, but we’re not being permitted to call those witnesses. It would seem that since Schiff, for example, misled the American people on multiple occasions, common sense and basic fairness would call for Schiff to be questioned about those things, but we can’t. Mr. Chairman, back in 1998, when another president, Bill Clinton, was being considered for impeachment, you said, and I quote, “We must not overturn an election and impeach a president without an overwhelming consensus of the American people and the representatives in Congress.” You also said, “There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment substantially supported by one of the major political parties and originally opposed by the other.” You said, “Such an impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come, and we’ll call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions.” That’s what you said back then, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-04	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Well, what you said should never happen, that we should never do, is exactly what you’re doing now. Moving forward without a consensus and impeachment by one major party that’s opposed by the other, and it’s almost certain that it’s going to result in the very divisiveness and bitterness that you so accurately warned us about back then. Mr. Chairman, a couple more quotes from a very wise Jerry Nadler , from about two decades ago. “The last thing you want, it’s almost illegitimate, is to have a party line impeachment. You shouldn’t impeach the president unless it’s a broad consensus of the American people.” Those are wise words, Mr. Chairman, but you’re not following them today. And finally, again your words back then, “The issue in a potential impeachment is whether to overturn the results of a national election, the free expression of the popular will of the American people. That is an enormous responsibility and an extraordinary power. It is not one we should exercise lightly. It is certainly not one which should be exercised in a manner which either is or would be perceived by the American people to be unfair or partisan.
2019-12-04	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Again, Mr. Chairman, those things that you warned against then are exactly what you and your democratic colleagues are doing now. You’re about to move forward with a totally party line impeachment that is clearly not a broad consensus of the American people. You’re overturning the result of a national election, and there’s no doubt that it will be perceived by at least half of the American people as an unfair and partisan effort. You seem bound and determined to move forward with this impeachment and the American people deserve better. I get it. Democrats on this committee don’t like this president. They don’t like his policies, they don’t like him as a person, they hate his tweets. They don’t like the fact that the Mueller investigation was a flop. So now you’re going to impeach him.
2019-12-04	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Well, I got news for you. You may be able to twist enough arms in the house to impeach the president, but that effort’s going to die in the Senate. The president’s going to serve out his term in office, and in all likelihood, be reelected to a second term, probably with the help of this very impeachment charade that we’re going through now. And while you’re wasting so much of Congress’s time and the American people’s money on this impeachment, there are so many other important things that are going undone. Within this committee’s own jurisdiction, we should be addressing the opioid epidemic, we could be working together to find a solution to our immigration and asylum challenges on our Southern border, we could be protecting Americans from having their intellectual property and jobs stolen by Chinese companies, and we could be enhancing election security just to name a few things. And Congress as a whole could be working on rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, providing additional tax relief to the nation’s middle class families and providing additional security to our people here at home and abroad. Instead, here we are spinning our wheels once again on impeachment. What a waste. The American people deserve so much better. I yield back.
2019-12-04	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Gentleman yields back. Mr. Cohen.
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a second hearing on impeachment that this committee has held in the last week. Well, I would submit that your investigating the wrong guy. Let’s look at the facts. Mr. Castor, Ukraine, that’s been at the center of attention in this impeachment hearing, has historically been one of the world’s most corrupt nations. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	And under legislation that Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, it was President Trump’s responsibility, his duty to see that US tax dollars did not go to Ukraine unless they were making progress in reducing corruption. Is that also right?
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	And isn’t it true that Joe Biden’s son Hunter had placed himself right smack dab in the middle of that corruption?
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	And contrary to what House Democrats in many in the media would have you believe the concerns about Hunter Biden’s involvement in Ukrainian corruption, they’re not some sort of vast right wing conspiracy concocted by supporters of the president. Are they? In fact the concerns about Hunter Biden were first raised by the Obama Administration? Is that right?
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	And the Obama administration’s concerns about Biden didn’t end there. Did they? The former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Ivanoich, said she was coached by the Obama Administration on how to answer pesky questions related to a Hunter Biden and Burisma that might arise during her Senate confirmation process. Is that right?
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	And nearly every single witness who testified at the intelligence committee impeachment inquiry agreed that Hunter Biden’s Burisma deal created at the very least the appearance of conflict of interest. Is that correct?
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	And yet with all that evidence, the Democrats on the intelligence committee under Chairman Schiff and now the Democrats here are determined to sweep the Biden corruption under the rug, ignore it, not let us call witnesses on it and instead rush to impeach the president all to satisfy, I would argue, their radical left wing base. What a disservice to the country. Imagine this, you’ve got the Vice President Joe Biden in charge of overseeing our Ukrainian policy and his son Hunter Biden receiving 50 grand a month with no identifiable expertise in either energy or Ukraine.
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Yet the Democrats won’t let us present witnesses on that. So let’s do the next best thing since we can’t bring the witnesses here, let’s watch a couple of videos.
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	Joe Biden got a little testy with a voter at one of his events in Iowa last week, calling a man a liar, challenging him to a pushup contest, among other things. And falsely stating once again that nobody said there was anything wrong with his son’s deal in Ukraine. Well, you know what, that’s a lot of malarkey. A lot of people have been saying that for quite awhile now and they’re right. And what’s worse is that first the intelligence committee and now this committee are conducting an impeachment investigation against President Trump based on as Professor Turley put it last week, wafer thin evidence and ignoring evidence of a high level US official who actually did engage in a quid pro quo with Ukrainian government in fact confessed to it in this video.
2019-12-09	Steve Chabot	R-Others	Republican	You’re investigating the wrong guy, Mr. Chairman.
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	No.
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Could I begin just with a show of hands. How many on the panel actually voted for Donald Trump in 2016?
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Just show of hands.
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	I think you’ve made your positions, Professor Karlan, very, very clear.
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Let me rephrase the question. How many of you-
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	How many of you supported Donald Trump in 2016? Show of hands. Thank you. Perfect. Professor-
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Professor Turley, this impeachment inquiry has been predicated on some rather disturbing legal doctrines. One Democrat asserted that hearsay can be much better evidence than direct evidence. Speaker Pelosi and others who have said that the President’s responsibility is to present evidence to prove his innocence. Chairman Schiff’s asserted, and we heard a discussion from some of your colleagues today, that if you invoke legal rights in defense of criminal accusations, ipso facto that’s an obstruction of justice and evidence of guilt.
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	My question of you is what does it mean to our American justice system if these doctrines take root in our country?
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Well, that-
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Well then, are we in danger of abusing our own power of doing enormous violence to our Constitution by proceeding in this manner? My Democratic colleagues have been searching for a pretext for impeachment since before the President was sworn I. On this panel, Professor Karlan called President Trump’s election illegitimate in 2017. She implied impeachment was a remedy. Professor Feldman advocated impeaching the President over a tweet that he made in March of 2017. That’s just seven weeks after his inauguration. Are we in danger of succumbing to the maxim of Lewis Carroll’s Red Queen, sentence first verdict afterwards?
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	I need to go on here. The Constitution says the executive authority shall be vested in a president of the United States. Does that mean some of the executive authority or all of it?
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Well, I tend to agree with that. The Constitution commands the President take care that the laws be faithfully enforced. That does in effect make him the chief law enforcement officer in the federal government, does it not?
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	So if probable cause exists to believe a crime has been committed, does the President have the authority to inquire into that matter?
2019-12-04	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Let me ask you one final question. The National Defense Authorization Act that authorized aid the Ukraine requires the Secretary of Defense and State certify that the government of Ukraine is taking substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for, among other things, for purposes of decreasing corruption. Is the President exercising that responsibility when he inquires into a matter that could involve illegalities between American and Ukrainian officials?
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In every election, one side wins and the other loses. Democracy only works because the losing side always respects the will of the voters. The moment that social compact breaks down, democracy collapses into chaos. And that’s only happened twice in our nation’s history. It happened in 1860 when the Democrats refused to accept the legitimate election of Abraham Lincoln. And it happened again in 2016 when the Democrats refused to accept the legitimate election of Donald Trump. The issues before us today do indeed strike at the heart of our democracy.
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	The first calls for impeachment began just days after the 2016 election, and ever since the Democrats had been searching for a pretext. When the Mueller investigation found no evidence to support the monstrous lie that the President acted in collusion with Russia, the Democrats realized they were running out of time and suddenly the Ukrainian phone call replaced collusion, Stormy Daniels, tax returns, emoluments, and even tweets as the reason to nullify the election just a year before the next one is to be held.
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Impeachment is one of the most serious powers with which Congress is entrusted. It requires an overwhelming case of high crimes supported by clear evidence that a vast majority of the nation deems compelling. Our constitution vests the executive authority, including the enforcement of our laws with the president, and it gives him sole authority to conduct our foreign affairs. Clearly, this includes requesting a foreign government to cooperate in resolving, potentially corrupt and illegal interactions between that governments officials and ours.
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	Now, the sum total of the Democrat’s case comes down to this, not one of their handpicked witnesses provided any firsthand knowledge of the president ordering a quid pro quo and two witnesses, Sondland by testimony and Senator Johnson by letter, provided firsthand testimony that the President specifically ordered no quid pro quo. No testimony was provided that the Ukrainian government believed that there was any quid pro quo, but there are ample public statements that his officials did not believe there was such a linkage.
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	In fact, the testimony of their witnesses crumbled under questioning and we were left with career bureaucrats who admitted that the only evidence they offered was presumption, speculation, and what they’d read in The New York Times. It’s upon this flimsy evidence that the Democrats justified nullifying the 2016 presidential election. And it’s so flimsy the Democrats have had to turn our Bill of Rights on its head in order to make it. They’ve argued that hearsay evidence better known as gossip is better than direct testimony.
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	They’ve argued that the burden of proof rests with the accused to prove his innocence, while at the same time denying the defense witnesses permission to testify. They’ve argued that the right to confront your accuser is an invasion of the accuser’s privacy. They’ve argued that appealing to the course to defend your constitutional rights as the President has done is ipso facto obstruction of justice and evidence of guilt.
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	They’ve asserted the power to determine what witnesses the defense is allowed to call, and they’ve argued that a crime is not necessary to impeach, only impure motives in performing otherwise lawful acts, mode is of course, to be divined entirely by the accusers. These are the legal doctrines of despots, but they’re the only ones that can accommodate the case before us today. This is a stunning abuse of power and a shameless travesty of justice that will stain the reputations of those responsible for generations to come, and God help our country if they should ever be given the power to replace our Bill of Rights with the doctrines that they have imposed in this process.
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	The Democrats are fond of saying no one’s above the law. They have one unspoken caveat, except for themselves. Now the speaker’s already short circuited what should be a solemn, painstaking, thorough and above all fair process by ordering her foot soldiers on this committee to draw up articles of impeachment without this committee hearing from a single fact witness. Despite the fact that Mr. Schiff doesn’t dare to appear before this committee to defend his work, we’re supposed to accept his report at face value and obediently follow the speaker’s orders.
2019-12-09	Tom McClintock	R-Others	Republican	As the Red Queen declared, sentence first, verdict afterwards. We can only pray the Senate still adheres to the judicial principles of our founders and if they do, perhaps then we can begin repairing the damage that this travesty has done to our democracy, our institutions, our principles of justice, our constitution, and our country.
2019-11-21	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Thank you, Dr. Hill, Mr. Holmes, for your years of service to this country ,and I appreciate you all being here today. Throughout this process, I have said that I want to learn the facts so we can get to the truth. So why are we here? Because of two things that occurred during the President?s July 25th phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky. The use of the phrase, ?Do us a favor,? though, in reference to the 2016 presidential election and the mention of the word Biden. I believe both statements were inappropriate, misguided foreign policy, and it?s certainly not how the executive, current or in the future, should handle such a call. Over the course of these hearings, the American people have learned about a series of events that in my view have undermined our national security and undercut Ukraine, a key partner on the front lines against Russian aggression.
2019-11-21	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	We?ve heard of U.S. officials carrying uncoordinated, confusing, and conflicting messages that created doubt and uncertainty in Kiev at a time when a new reformist administration has just taken office and was ready to fight corruption and work with us to advance other U.S. objectives. I disagree with this sort of bungling foreign policy. But through these hearings, many of my colleagues have unwittingly undermined the Ukrainian government by suggesting that it is subservient to the United States and without the United States, they wouldn?t be able to function. The Ukrainians, as you stayed, Mr. Holmes, is in a hot war with Russia, and they are holding their own. We could benefit from the experience of the Ukrainians, not the other way around.
2019-11-21	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	While I thought the Intelligence Committee would actually be engaged in oversight of the intelligence and national security communities, unfortunately we are not. We?re here talking about one of the most serious constitutional duties we have as members of Congress, the impeachment and removal of the President of the United States.
2019-11-21	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Over the past eight weeks, we?ve learned a few things. The officials on the July 25th call have many different opinions on whether the call was concerning or not, and just because Vice President Biden is running for president does not mean that corruption related to Burisma, Ukraine?s largest natural gas company, and American?s ties to it are not concerning.
2019-11-21	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	There?s also a lot we do not know. We have not heard from Rudy Giuliani. We haven?t heard from Hunter Biden. I?d like to know more about both of their activities, why they talked to whom and to whom. Despite promises from Chairman Schiff, we have also not heard from the whistleblower, something that can occur in a closed setting without violating his or her anonymity. We need to understand the motivations and level of coordination that happened prior to his or her submission of the complaint.
2019-11-21	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Over the past few weeks and even today, it?s been reiterated in 2017 the Trump administration made the decision to provide lethal defensive aid to the Ukraine after the Obama administration refused to do so. Ukraine is receiving all the security assistance as directed by Congress. President Zelensky has undertaken significant anti-corruption efforts including eliminating the parliamentary immunity from prosecution. And again, Mr. Holmes, you mentioned this today, under President Zelensky?s leadership, we have finally seen some progress this fall towards ending the Russian occupation of Eastern Ukraine.
2019-11-21	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Where does this leave us? An impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelmingly clear, and unambiguous, and it?s not something to be rushed or taken lightly. I?ve not heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion. I also reject the notion that holding this view means supporting all the foreign policy choices we have been hearing about over these last few weeks. To paraphrase Tim Morrison?s testimony this week, every day the national conversation on Ukraine is focused on impeachment, not the conflict in the Donbass, not the illegal occupation of Crimea, not the need for reforms in Ukraine?s government economy is a day where we are not focused on our shared national security interests with Kiev. I hope that we won?t let this very partisan process keep us from agreeing on how a free and prosperous Ukraine is important to the security of the Ukrainian people, the United States of America, and the rest of the world.
2019-11-21	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Mr. Chairman, before I yield back my time, I?d like to make a statement for the record that had this committee been given proper notice as required by House rule 11 clause 2G3 that a business meeting was to follow the last night?s hearing, and had Mr. Conaway?s point of order been appropriately recognized, I would have voted no on the committee?s first motion to table during last night?s impromptu meeting. And I yield back the balance of my time.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Your excellency, 33 years [inaudible 00:13:08]. I’ll move over here. 33 years, six Senior Foreign Service Performance Awards, five State Department Superior Honor Awards, the Presidential Distinguished Service Award and the Secretary’s Diplomacy in Human Rights Award. You’re tough as nails and you’re smart as hell. You’re a great example of what our ambassadors should be like.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	You’re an honor to your family, you are an honor to the foreign service, you are an honor to this country, and I thank you for all that you have done and will continue to do on behalf of your country.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Now I’m nervous about what I’m getting ready to do. I want to do a five year history of Ukraine in about 45 seconds, and now that you’re a professor you can grade my paper, okay?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Valentine’s Day, 2014, Ukrainian people get fed up with the Ukrainian President Yanukovych and basically overthrown him. He goes on the run. This was the Revolution of Dignity. Who was the acting president during that time when Yanukovych went out?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Turchynov, is that how you say it?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Turchynov. Okay, excellent. Then in March of 2014, that is when we saw little green men coming into Ukraine, and ultimately the Russians invade the Ukraine, and not only try to annex Crimea, but they invade the entire country and the Eastern Don Bass as well.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Then there was an election, and the Ukrainian President was Poroshenko. That was in June of 2014. Then you came to post in 2016 of August, is that correct?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	January, 2017 Trump was elected, and in December of 2017 is when the Javelins were approved, right?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And we saw those Javelins delivered in April of 2018 to be put the first use.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Then we had a Zelensky elected in 2019, April. Correct?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Now, Zelensky defeated the previous President Poroshenko.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	There’s no love lost between those two dudes is there?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Okay. And then in May of 2019, Zelensky is sworn in.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	So my questions, we talk a lot about Rudy Giuliani, do we know what officials within the Zelensky regime he actually met with? I know, too. A gentleman named by Yermak, who was one of Zelensky’s senior advisors, and then we also know of the former Attorney General that we’ve already established here. We didn’t [inaudible 01:58:11] was corrupt, Lutsenko.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	All right. And Mr. Lutsenko served under Zelensky for a couple of months up until April. I mean, excuse me, August. Is that correct?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And their parliament basically voted him out, is that correct?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	So, if Rudy Giuliani is trying to influence the Zelensky regime, would a guy that worked under the previous regime, under Poroshenko, be the right guy to do it?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Yes.
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	So, did Mr. Lutsenko have much credibility within the Zelensky regime? The regime?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	He didn’t. Now Mr. Yermak did. Do you know of any other Ukrainians that Mr. Giuliani was meeting with that was part of the Zelensky regime?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	But even with the administration to come, right? Zelensky won the election, there was a two month period of preparing to be installed as president. Even during that time, were you aware of any contact?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Sure. But those are not people that were actually in government or became in the Zelensky regime, is that correct?
0201-11-15	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Okay. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Mr. Morrison, my colleague from California suggests he knows your opinions and your thoughts better than you do. Do you have anything? He didn’t give you the opportunity to respond. Do you have a response or want to give a response?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Good copy. While we’re with you Mr. Morrison. Thanks for your testimony, your clear and sober testimony today. Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about how political information collected by Ukraine on the Bidens would be used for political gain?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Ambassador Volker, same question. Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about how potential information collected by Ukraine on the Bidens would be used for political gain?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	There’s been a lot of discussions about a text exchange you had with Mr. [Yermack 01:33:41] on August 12th that talked about this proposed statement, and Mayor Giuliani provided some feedback on what he thought needed to be included in that. Did Mayor Giuliani get feedback from the President on what should go into that proposed statement?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Based on your recollection, Ambassador Volker, who within the Zelinsky regime has Mayor Giuliani interacted with? Now in addition to Mr. Yermack, which we’ve already talked about, and also the former Attorney General, Mr. [Lushanko 01:34:19].
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Yeah, but that’s not within-
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	The current regime in which we’re talking about.
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	In as few words as possible, what was your understanding of Ambassador Sondland’s role in Ukraine?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Was Ambassador Sondland having conversations with senior Zelinsky officials without letting other people know?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Can you say that you have a clear understanding of what Ambassador Sondland and Mayor Giuliani were doing in all their interactions with Ukrainian officials?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	If you didn’t have a clear understanding as the special representative of Ukraine, do you think the Ukrainians had a clear understanding?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	You thought there was a difference between Burisma and Biden in the 2016 elections, is that correct?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	As you testified earlier. Do you think the Ukrainians had similar understanding?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	There’s also a perception that when Ambassador Yovanovitch, who we’ve all, her 33 years of being an awesome ambassador, that when she left Kiev that the U.S. position on corruption would weaken. That’s kind of a narrative that’s floating around. Who was the person that took over for her in the interim, who was the charge after-
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Was this individual strong or weak on corruption?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And after that individual who was that person replaced with?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Who you suggested for that position, correct?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Was Ambassador Taylor strong or weak on corruption?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Mr. Morrison in my last 23 minutes, who sets official U.S. policy?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Not some other staffer within the NSC process?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Thank you. I yield back.
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Miss Williams, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you for your service. We share a personal hero in Dr. Rice. So great minds think alike.
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about how potential information collected from the Ukrainians on the Bidens would be used for political gain?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Thank you. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I think all of us would agree that your father made the right move to come here and we’re glad that he did. You’ve talked about how part of your responsibilities is developing talking points for your principles. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	President. I’m assuming you also do that for your direct supervisor, currently right now, Mr. Morrison. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	But you prepare talking points for your supervisors. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	But traditionally, I’m just trying to establish-
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	That this position is somebody that creates talking points for a number of people. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Do they always use them?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Is President Trump known to stick to a script?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	So is it odd that he didn’t use your talking points?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	In your deposition … If your lawyer wants to follow on, it’s page 306 … You were asked about events during the temporary hold on US assistance to Ukraine. This is that 55 day period or so. And you testified that the US administration did no receive any new assurances from Ukraine about anti-corruption efforts and the facts on the ground did not change before the hold was lifted. Is that accurate in recounting your testimony?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	When was President Zelensky sworn in?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And then he had a new Parliament too, elected after he was. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And when was that Parliament seated?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	That was when they won, right? They weren’t properly seated until August? Is that-
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Your boss’s boss, Ambassador Bolton, traveled to Ukraine in late August, right? August 27, 28. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Did he take you with him?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	We know form other witnesses that when Ambassador Bolton was there, he met with President Zelensky and his staff and they talked about how they were visually exhausted because one of the things that President Zelensky did during that time period was change the Ukrainian constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada deputies. Right? Some of their parliamentarians. Because that had been the source of raw corruption for a number of years. Is that accurate?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Were you aware of this important change to Ukrainian law?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And you don’t believe that’s a significant anti-corruption effort?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	It’s pretty significant, correct? Also, Ambassador Taylor testified that President Zelensky, with this new Parliament, opened Ukraine’s high anti-corruption court. Right? This had been an initiative that many folks in our State Department had been pushing to happen. And that was established in that time frame. Were you aware of this?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Do you think this is a significant anti-corruption?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	When you talked about … How many times have you met President Zelensky?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And that’s a one on one meeting?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	So there was a lot of people in the room-
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	When you met with him.
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	But you still advised the Ukrainian president to watch out for the Russians.
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And everybody else in the room I’m assuming, the national security advisory was there, I believe. In this case, you had other members of the administration. Were your points pre approved? Did they know you were going to bring up those points?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And you counseled the Ukrainian president to stay out of US politics?
0201-11-19	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Mr. Chairman, I yield back the time I do not have.
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Gentlemen, I appreciate you all’s decade of service as the fabled foreign service officer, Ambassador Ryan Crocker says, because we have pumps and wingtips on the ground, meaning diplomats that prevents us from having the need to have boots on the ground, the military. You all are an important role in our national security and thank you and your colleagues. Mr. Taylor, my first questions are to you, and these are questions that are on years prior to your time in the Ukraine, but I’m pretty sure you can answer them. Did the Ukrainians get aid in FY ’17?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Yeah.
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And they got security assistance as well?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And if I said that number was circa, in military assistance around 270 million, would that probably be accurate?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	About right?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Did they get aid in FY ’18?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Including security assistance?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	We’ve already talked about the javelins, the anti-tank missiles that they were not able to purchase in previous administrations. Have they gotten security assistance in FY ’19?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Prior to the 400 million or so that we’re discussing or been discussing a lot here today?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	My point is that we have been supporting the Ukrainians under this administration in order to help them kick out the Russians who invaded their country.
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Ambassador Taylor, you are testifying that Ukrainian officials did not become aware of potential US assistance being withheld until August 29th, is that accurate?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Would you find it surprising if a Ukrainian official knew about that sooner and did not contact you?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Good copy. Mr. Kent, had you had any Ukrainian official contacting you concerned about … When was the first time a Ukrainian official contacted you concerned about potential withholding of USAID?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Got you, so after that August 29th conversation. There’s a lot of talk about Rudy Giuliani and who he was and wasn’t meeting. Do we know or have an idea of the Ukrainian officials that he was meeting with over the last couple of years?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Have you had any Ukrainian officials call you after a meeting with Rudy Giuliani concerned about the nature of the context of that conversation?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And I believe that meeting was somewhere in late August, is that correct?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And you all have talked many times that you all are still concerned about corruption and Ukraine. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Have we seen whatever this anti-corruption statement we wanted the Ukrainians to make?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Yes.
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	What was the statement?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	But that statement was never agreed to or was never issued by the Ukrainian officials. Is that correct?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	And have US businesses ever contacted you all concerned about corruption within Ukraine?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	As of this year, even?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	Because the concern is not just how Ukrainian businesses run by oligarchs are being operated, it’s also concerns about how the Ukrainian government is dealing with American businesses trying to operate in Ukraine. Is that accurate?
2019-11-13	Will Hurd	R-Hurd	Republican	I yield back in time I do not have, Mr. Chairman.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do I need to adjust the microphone?
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I believe it is now. Is that right?
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, ranking member Nunes and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify before you today. I have a short opening statement. I appreciate the importance of Congress?s impeachment inquiry. I?m appearing today as a fact witness as I did during my deposition on October 14th in order to answer your questions about what I saw, what I did, what I knew and what I know with regard to the subjects of your inquiry.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I believe that those who have information that the Congress deems relevant have a legal and a moral obligation to provide it. I take great pride in the fact that I?m a nonpartisan foreign policy expert who was served under three Republican and Democratic presidents. I have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction except toward the truth. I will not provide a long narrative statement because I believe that the interest of Congress and the American people is best served by allowing you to ask me your questions. I?m happy to expand upon my October 14th deposition testimony and respond to your questions today.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	But before I do so, I?d like to communicate two things. First, I?d like to show a little bit about who I am. I?m an American by choice having become a citizen in 2002. I was born in the Northeast of England in the same region that George Washington?s ancestors came from. Both my region and my family have deep ties to the United States. My paternal grandfather fought through World War I in the Royal Field Artillery surviving being shot, shelled and gassed before American troops intervened to end the war in 1918.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	During the second World War, other members of my family fought to defend the free world from fascism alongside American soldiers, sailors and airmen. The men in my father?s family were coal miners whose family has always struggled with poverty. When my father Alfred was 14, he joined his father, brothers, brother, uncles and cousins in the coal mines to help put food on the table. When the last of the local mines closed in the 1960s, my father wanted to emigrate to the United States to work in the coal mines in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. But his mother, my grandmother, had been crippled from hard labor and my father couldn?t leave. He stayed in Northern England until he died in 2012. My mother still lives in my hometown today.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	While his dream of emigrating to America was thwarted, my father loved America, its culture, its history, and its role as a beacon of hope for the world. He always wanted someone in the family to make it to the United States. I began my university studies in 1984. I just learned that I went to the same university as my colleague here, Mr. Holmes in St. Andrews in Scotland. Just thought I would add that. In 1987, I won a place on an academic exchange to the Soviet Union. I was there for the signing of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces INF Treaty and when president Ronald Reagan met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	This was a turning point for me. An American professor who I met there told me about graduate students scholarships to the United States. The very next year thanks to his advice, I arrived in America to start my advanced studies at Harvard. Years later, I can say with confidence that this country has offered me opportunities I never would have had in England. I grew up poor with a very distinctive working class accent. In England in the 1980s and 1990s, this would have impeded my professional advancement. This background has never sent me back in America.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	For the best part of three decades, I?ve built a career as a nonpartisan, nonpolitical, national security professional focusing on Europe and Eurasia and especially the former Soviet Union. I?ve served our country under three presidents. My most recent capacity under President Trump, as well as in my former position as national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In that role, I was the intelligence community senior expert on Russia and the former Soviet Republics including Ukraine.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It was because of my background and experience that I was asked to join the National Security Council in 2017. At the NSC, Russia was part of my portfolio, but I was also responsible for coordinating US policy for all of Western Europe, all of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and Turkey, along with NATO and the European Union. I was hired initially by General Michael Flynn, K.T. McFarland and General Keith Kellogg. But then I started working April 2017 when General McMaster was the national security advisor.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I, and they, thought that I could help them with President Trump?s stated goal of improving relations with Russia while still implementing policies designed to deter Russian conduct that threatens the United States, including the unprecedented and successful Russian operation to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. This relates to the second thing I want to communicate.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its Security Services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps, somehow for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian Security Services themselves. The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports. It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remains evident today. Our nation is being turned apart. Truth is questioned. Our highly professional and expert career Foreign Service is being undermined. US support for Ukraine, which continues to face armed Russian aggression has been politicized. The Russian government?s goal is to weaken our country, to diminish America?s global role and to neutralize a perceived US threat to Russian interests. President Putin and the Russian Security Services aim to counter US foreign policy objectives in Europe, including in Ukraine, where Moscow wishes to reassert political economic dominance.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I say this not as an alarmist, but as a realist. I do not think long-term conflict with Russia is either desirable or inevitable. I continue to believe that we need to seek ways of stabilizing our relationship with Moscow even as we come to their efforts to harm us. Right now, Russia?s Security Services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We?re running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interest.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	As Republicans and Democrats have agreed for decades, Ukraine is a valued partner of the United States. It plays an important role in our national security. As I told the committee last month, I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a US adversary and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016. These fictions are harmful even if they?re deployed for purely domestic political purposes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	President Putin and the Russian Security Services operate like a super PAC. They deploy millions of dollars to weaponize our own political opposition research and false narratives. When we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each other, degrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I respect the work that this Congress does in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities, including this inquiry. I?m here to help you to the best of my ability. If the president or anyone else impedes or subverts the national security of the United States in order to further domestic, political, or personal interests, that?s more than worthy of your attention. But we must not let domestic politics stop us from defending ourselves against the foreign powers who truly wish us harm.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I?m ready to answer your questions. Thank you.     Part 2
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	"The Russians? interests, frankly, to de-legitimized our entire Presidency. So I want an issue that I do want to raise, and I think that this would resonate with our colleagues on the Committee from the Republican party, is that the goal of the Russians was really to put whoever became the President by trying to tip their hands on one side of the scale under a cloud. So if Secretary, former First Lady, former Senator Clinton, had been elected as President, as indeed many expected in the run up to the election in 2016, she, too would have had major questions about her legitimacy. And I think that what we?re seeing here as a result of all of these narratives is this is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for. If they seed misinformation, they see doubt. They have everybody questioning the legitimacy of a Presidential candidate, be it President Trump or potentially a President Clinton; that they would pit one side of our electorate against the other; that they would pit one party against the other."
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	"And that?s why I wanted to make such a strong point at the very beginning, because there was certainly individuals in many other countries who had harsh words for both of the candidates; who had harsh words for many of the candidates during the primaries. We had a lot of people who were running for President on the Republican side. There were many people who are trying themselves to game the outcome. As you know, in the United Kingdom, the bookies take bets. You can go to Logbrooks or William Hill and lay a bet on who you think is going to be the candidate. So the Russian government were trying to land their own bets, but what they wanted to do was give a spread. They wanted to make sure that whoever they had bet on or whoever they?d tried to tip the scales, would also experience some discomfort; that they were beholden to them in some way; that they would create just the kind of chaos that we have seen in our politics. So I just want to again emphasize that we need to be very careful as we discuss all of these issues, not to give them more fodder that they can use against us in 2020."
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, that?s absolutely the case, and in fact you just made the point about U.S. allies. The Russians like to put a lot of blame on U.S. allies for incidents that they have perpetrated. We saw that recently with the United Kingdom in the Russian secret services attack on a former spy, Mr. Scripholland, his daughter in Salisbury in England. Well, you may recall that the Russians actually accused the British government of perpetrating this themselves. So this falls into a long pattern of deflection, and of the Russian government trying to pin the blame on someone else. And as my colleague, Mr. Holmes, here has laid out, the Russians have a particular vested interest in putting Ukraine and Ukrainians and Ukrainian leaders in a very bad light.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	"All of the issues that we started to discuss today, and that you on the Committee have been deeply involved in, began with Russia?s illegal annexation of the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014; in response in 2015, and all of the different acts of aggression that Russia?s engaged in since starting a war in the Donbas; shooting down Russian operatives, a plane MH-17 over the Donbas at a later period. There is a great deal of hostility and malign intent towards the Ukraine, and it suits the Russian government very much if we are also looking at Ukraine as somehow a perpetrator of malign acts against us."
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct, sir. Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	He told me it was the President.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s right.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I can?t actually. Sometimes there would be multiple calls during a week. I was there for more than two years, so it?s a fair number.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I don?t want to comment on this call because this is, in my view, executive privilege. In terms of the testimony ? Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, again, I?d like to just focus in this testimony on this particular call, and I will just say that I found this particular call subject matter and the way that it was conducted surprising.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Because of the nature of the discussion, the juxtaposition of the issues in which they were raised, and also given the fact that I, myself, had actually imposed, along with Ambassador Bolton for some period, having a call unless it was very well prepared, and we were confident that the issues that Ukraine and the United States were most generally together interested in were going to be raised. And I saw in this call that this was not the case.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I don?t think it was specifically about that call, but I recall the testimony because this was clearly the discussion preceding the call. Remember, I left on July 19th, and the call took place the following week. In the months leading up to that, from May onwards, it became very clear that the White House meeting itself was being predicated on other issues, namely investigations and the questions about the election interference in 2016.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	The reference to Crowdstrike and the server, yes, that?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That appears to be the case, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I think we have to be very careful about the way that we phrase that. This is a view that President Putin and the Russian Security Services and many [inaudible 00:27:13] in Russia have promoted, but I think that this view has also got some traction, perhaps in parallel and separately here in the United States, and those two things have, over time, started to fuse together.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I do.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I?m not sure that I can say that President Trump had asked the Vice President Pence. I was not in any meeting in which that took place. I can say that I, myself, and many others at the NSC and in the State Department were quite keen, very eager to have Vice President Pence go to Ukraine to represent the United States government and the President.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I was certainly aware, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct. Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I do recall, yes. It was part of a conversation about the things that Mr. Giuliani was saying very frequently in public. We saw him often on television making these statements, and I had already brought to Ambassador Bolton?s attention the attacks, the smear campaign against Ambassador Yovanovitch, and expressed great regret about how this was unfolding. And, in fact, the shameful way in which Ambassador Yovanovitch was being smeared and attacked, and I?d asked if there was anything that we could do about it. And Ambassador Bolton had looked pained, basically indicated with body language that there was nothing much that we could do about it, and he then, in the course of that discussion, said that Rudy Giuliani was a hand grenade that was going to blow everyone up.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did, actually.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I think that he meant that obviously what Mr. Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive in any case. He was frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks about everyone involved in this, and that he was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would probably come back to haunt us. And in fact, I think that that?s where we are today.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s not quite right. I was told in passing that someone else at the National Security Council, that president may want to speak to them because of some materials related to Ukraine.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That was correct. It was a very brief conversation, just to be clear.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	The director for Ukraine is Alex Vindman, Colonel Vindman.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	The individual just said the name Kash.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Initially, when I was thinking about it, I had to search my mind, and the only Kash that I knew at the National security council was Kash Patel.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Not that I oversaw. No.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That seemed to be the indication.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It was very apparent to me that that was what Rudy Giuliani intended. Yes. Intended to confer that Burisma was linked to the Bidens, and he said this publicly, repeatedly.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I am not. No.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct. Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, the initial intent had not been to include them. We?d anticipated that the two Ukrainian officials would have a number of meetings, as is usually the procedure, and that there would be meetings at the State Department, potentially also at the Energy Department. Then there was a request to have Ambassadors Sondland and Volker included, coming directly from their offices. As a result of that, clearly given the important role that Secretary Perry was playing in the energy sector reform in Ukraine and the fact that he?d also been in the delegation to the presidential inauguration in Ukraine, we decided that it would be better than to include all three of them.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I listen very carefully to Ambassador Sondland?s testimony yesterday, so I want to actually point out something where I think it?s easy to explain why he had a different interpretation of how this came into being.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	The meeting had initially been scheduled for about 45-minutes to an hour, and it was definitely in the wrap-up phase of the meeting when this occurred. We?d gone through a series of discussions, Alexander Daniluk, who is at this point the designated National Security Advisor of Ukraine, really wanted to get into the weeds of how he might reform a national security council. He talked to me about this prior to the meeting. He was hoping and had had this opportunity with the National Security Advisor of the United States to get his firsthand opinions and thoughts on what might happen.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	We?d also wanted to go through a discussion about how important it was for Ukraine to get its energy sector reform underway, and clearly Secretary Perry had some talking points to this. This is an issue that Ambassador Bolton was also interested in.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	And then we knew that the Ukrainians would have on their agenda, inevitably, the question about a meeting. As we get through the main discussion, we are going into that wrap-up phase. The Ukrainians, Mr. Daniluk, starts to ask about a White House meeting and Ambassador Bolton was trying to parry this back. Although he?s the National Security Advisor, he?s not in charge of scheduling the meeting. We have input recommending the meetings, and this goes through a whole process. It?s not Ambassador Bolton?s role to start pulling out the schedule and start saying, ? Right, well, we?re going to look and see if this Tuesday in this month is going to work with this.? He does not as a matter of course like to discuss the details of these meetings, he likes to leave them to the appropriate staff for this. So this was already going to be an uncomfortable issue.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	As Ambassador Bolton was trying to move that part of the discussion away, I think he was going to try to deflect it onto another wrap-up topic, Ambassador Sondland leaned in basically to say, ?Well, we have an agreement that there will be a meeting if specific investigations are put underway.? That?s when I saw Ambassador Bolton stiffen. I was sitting behind him in the chair, and I saw him sit back slightly like this. He?d been more moving forward, like I am, to the table. For me, that was an unmistakable body language, and it caught my attention. Then he looked up to the clock and at his watch, or towards his wrist in any case ? Again, I was sitting behind him ? and basically said, ?Well, it?s been really great to see you. I?m afraid I?ve got another meeting.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	In that particular juncture, I don?t believe so. It was later, which I?m sure you?ll want to talk about, that he did say more specifically.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Later he said that he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney that in return for investigations this meeting would get scheduled.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	He said the investigations in Burisma.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I had a discussion with Ambassador Bolton both after the meeting in his office, a very brief one, and then one immediately afterwards, the subsequent meeting.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I just want to highlight first of all that Ambassador Bolton wanted me to hold back in the room immediately after the meeting. Again, I was sitting on the sofa with colleague and everybody else was at the table.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Yes, but he was making a very strong point that he wanted to know exactly what was being said. When I came back and relayed to it to him, he had some very specific instruction for me. I?m presuming that that?s the question that you?re asking.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	The specific instruction was that I had to go to the lawyers, to John Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the National Security Council, to basically say, ?You tell Eisenberg Ambassador Bolton told me that I am not part of this, whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I took it to mean investigations for a meeting.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I certainly did.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I relayed it precisely, and then more of the details of how the meeting had unfolded as well, which I gave a full description of this in my October 14 deposition.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	No.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	No.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Only in the course of my previous position as the national intelligence officer for Russia, where he attended some of the meetings I presided over.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s a long time ago, correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	No.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I?m afraid I don?t. I actually had met with him ? you asked me actually in the deposition when the most recent time that I?d met with him in 2016. And he retired from the British Intelligence Services in 2009, which is the same time-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	2016, I don?t recall, but I did meet with him some times before 2016.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I don?t, I?m afraid, no.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That was one of my colleagues at the Brookings Institution.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That was the Brookings Institution president, Strobe Talbott, who had been sent a copy of this.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That was the day before it was published in Buzzfeed.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	At the time I did not know. I understand from the media that it was through GPS Fusion. If that?s not correct-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I didn?t at the time, no, I did not.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well now I?ve read it in reports and thanks to your colleagues as well that it was the DNC as I?m led to believe.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I don?t know that for sure.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Hope you did too.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I was not, that?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I personally did not believe that it was going to be scheduled at that date, no.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I?ve learned from other depositions to be clear here that perhaps there was some awareness that there might be a call. Ambassador Sondland, if you may recall, showed an exchange with the person who was taking over from my position, Tim Morrison, in which he indicated that there would be a call coming up. I was not aware of that.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	There were differences let?s just say, obviously, in understanding about that call.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Actually, I was not, and I did say something about that in the opening part of the sessions today.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I know that Ambassador Sondland said in that email that Bolton was in agreement. To my knowledge, Bolton was not in agreement at that particular juncture, to my knowledge.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It was based on the fact that he didn?t feel the call had been properly prepared. And as I said earlier, that we wanted to make sure that there was going to be a fulsome bilateral U.S., Ukraine agenda that was discussed, which is usual with these calls.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I was when I learned about it, that?s right.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did not, no.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I learned about that on July 18th, so the day before I left, that?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I said that I knew there was going to be a meeting in that timeframe and there was one put onto the schedule for the following week, but of course I had left and so I didn?t attend that.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s also correct, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	About the foreign assistance review?
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	As I understood there?d had been a directive for a whole scale review of our foreign policy assistance and the ties between our foreign policy objectives and the assistance. This has been going on actually for many months. And in the period when I was wrapping up my time there, there had been more scrutiny then specific assistance to specific sets of countries as a result of that overall review.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, Ambassador Volker was always involved in Ukraine policy, at least since the beginning of his appointment as the Special Envoy for negotiations towards the war between Ukraine and Russia and Donbass.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Ambassador Volker is an extraordinary accomplished diplomat. I?ve worked with him in many capacities previously. You know his bio, he?s been the ambassador to NATO. He?s had a number of positions at the State Department and actually I know him personally. So the truth that we?re trying to get at of who knows who and who?s met. I know Ambassador Volker really well on a personal level as well.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Absolutely, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, it came in different ways. Ambassador Sondland as the ambassador to the E.U. had some perfectly logical involvement in the Ukraine portfolio. We work very closely with the European Union on matters related to Ukraine. The Ukrainian dialogue with Russia was in a format known as the Minsk Process, which was led by the French and the Germans. And Ambassador Volker was trying to find out ways in which he could work closely with the French and Germans to move along on the resolution of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. And obviously the European Union, as the umbrella organization for Europe in terms of funding an assistance, was heavily active in offering financial assistance to the Ukrainian government as well as humanitarian assistance in the conflict. So it was perfectly logical that Ambassador Sondland would play some kind of role as our ambassador to the European Union.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did at the time in which he presented it to me. This was after Ambassador Yovanovitch had been pushed out of her position and it was at that juncture that Ambassador Sondland?s role seem to grow larger.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did express concerns to him directly.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I asked him quite bluntly in a meeting that we had in June of 2019, so this is after the presidential inauguration when I?d seen that he had started to step up in much more of a proactive role in Ukraine. What was his role here? And he said that he was in charge of Ukraine and I said, ?Well, who put you in charge, Ambassador Sondland? And he said, ?The President.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It did surprise me, we?d had no directive. We haven?t been told this. Ambassador Bolton had never indicated in any way that he thought that Ambassador Sondland was playing a leading role in Ukraine.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I can?t remember where I said, ?remit,? but it was portfolio. He was constantly, you know, these are all synonyms. He was talking to us about the fact that he?d been given a very broad portfolio by the President. He said his job was to go out and make deals in Europe. And as you know yourself, I listened to his testimony yesterday very carefully as well. He said that anything that had to do with the E.U. itself and the European Union member states was within his portfolio.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	At different points, he mentioned talking directly to the Chief of Staff Mulvaney and he also talked about Secretary Pompeo. In fact, there were other people in the room in the meeting in which he asserted this to me, that it was the President who had put him in charge of this.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I was not.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I related those concerns directly to my counterpart who was Acting Assistant Secretary, Phil Reeker, who I know you?ve spoken to. I also spoke to David Hale in the context of larger meetings about many other issues. I mean, again, I covered a broad portfolio myself and we often would talk about individual items. And I had private discussions with Deputy Secretary Sullivan and he of course appeared before committees here in the course of his nomination to be ambassador to Russia and has spoken about that himself.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did, that?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I was not initially in 2015 before I joined the government. And I?m sure that many people on the committee have seen that I wrote an opinion piece with a colleague at the Brookings Institution in that juncture. Because I was very worried at that particular point in time that the Ukrainian military was not in a fit state to really take on board sophisticated weapons, be they defensive or offensive weapons. And I worried that there was not a longterm sustainable plan given the overwhelming force that the Russians could apply against the Ukrainians. However, when I came into government in 2017 and started to interact with all of my colleagues in the Pentagon and you had Laura Cooper here yesterday, I realized in fact that there?d been an awful lot of work done on this. And that there was a clear and consistent plan for the sustainability long term of the Ukrainian military so I changed my mind.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I was, and I think it was very much made on a political basis about concerns that this would provoke the Russians depending on how this was presented. And we were very mindful of that also when there were the discussions internally about the lethal defensive weapons inside of the administration.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I do not.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I know that you?ve heard the testimony of Jennifer Williams from the Vice President?s office and I defer to her as being much closer to the decision making about the Vice President?s attendance. I will say that I and many others hope that the Vice President would be able to attend. And what I know from my perspective, because I was not involved intimately in discussions with the Pice President or his immediate staff was that there was some questions about the schedule. As you all know, the president and Vice President can not be out of the country at the same time. And there was some questions about presidential travel in the same timeframe. And you know there was a quite a bit of back and forth as to whether it would be really feasible for the Vice President in that timeframe to go. So that was what I was aware of. I wasn?t aware to the extent of the discussions that obviously Ms. Williams was involved in.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I personally do not, but again, I defer to Ms. Williams.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I do.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That was in May, that?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	To be honest usually, these meetings are around lunchtime, sometime in that timeframe, in the kind of early to mid part of the day. But I can?t speak for sure and I just want to be very clear that I cannot speak about head of state engagements.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	About the lunchtime timeframe, yeah, depending on when one has lunch, I guess.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I do and let me also make a point that we don?t try to make these delegations large. This is on the taxpayer?s dime and it?s pretty expensive getting people there. If you have to get military [inaudible 00:24:16] and we try to keep them small. If we had a longer lead time, perhaps we would have made other arrangements. But four days is not a lot of time to make an arrangement.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I actually recommended that Secretary Perry be the leader along with others.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, Secretary Perry?s engagement, and this made again perfect sense given his role as a Secretary of Energy, also his deep knowledge of the energy industry, his farmer governorship, Secretary Perry himself is an extraordinary good advocate of U.S. interest, particularly in the energy sphere. And one of Ukraine?s achilles heel in addition to it?s military disadvantage with Russia is in fact energy. Ukraine remains for now the main transit point for a Russian oil and gas and pipelines to Europe. And this has been manipulated repeatedly, especially since 2006 by the Russian government. And in fact, I mean many of you here will remember in the Reagan era, there was a huge dispute between the United States and Europe about whether it made sense for Europe to build pipelines from the then Soviet Union to bring gas to European markets.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Only from newspaper reports.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I also did not know-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did not know, no.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	The whole briefing process didn?t really work in the way that you?re suggesting there. So if the President had asked about any of this information it would have been provided for him. Just to be very clear, Ukraine was not a top foreign policy priority in this period in the same way that many other issues that we could talk about from Syria to Turkey and others are, so there weren?t that frequent briefings on Ukraine. The briefings would take place when there was a scheduled meeting with a Ukrainian head of state. And as we know there haven?t been too many of those.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	No, I did not know.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I think any family member of any member of the U.S. government, congress or the Senate is open to all kinds of questions about optics and of perhaps undue outside influence, if they take part in any kind of activity that could be misconstrued as being related their parent or the family member?s work. So as a matter of course, yes, I do think that?s the case.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Yes, I mean, unfortunately this is the federal government. We don?t have coffee machines readily in our office. If you?d come to my office in that time, the best I could have offered you was a cup of water from the water fountain outside of my office. So the coffee that Ambassador Sondland and I shared was actually, we?d run into each other or rather he found out I was going to be there and then asked me to meet him for coffee in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in 2018 in August. So this is a full year before I left. And that was a very nice coffee so perhaps he conflated those two meetings together. The meeting that he was referring to, he had come in to meet with our director for the European Union.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	This was in my last week in the office. And as I was in the office at the same time for a brief period before going into another meeting, and it was my last week in the office, we agreed to sit down with the director of the European Union, with actually Colonel Vindman and the assistant that Ambassador Sondland had brought with him from the State Department. So there were actually four of us in that meeting, and unfortunately it wasn?t over coffee.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Actually there were five of us really, I mean obviously I can?t do math, sorry.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I think you might recall in my deposition on October 14th that I said that very unfortunately I had a bit of a blowup with Ambassador-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	[inaudible 00:33:00] that I said that very unfortunately I had a bit of a blowup with ambassador Sondland and I had a couple of testy encounters with them. One of those was in June ?18 when I actually said to him, ?Who put you in charge of Ukraine?? And I?ll admit I was a bit rude. And that?s when he told me the president, which shut me up. And this other meeting, it was about 15, 20 minutes exactly as he depicted it was, I was actually, to be honest, angry with him. And I hate to say it, but often when women show anger, it?s not fully appreciated. It?s often pushed onto emotional issues perhaps or deflected onto other people. And what I was angry about, was that he wasn?t coordinating with us. Now actually realize having listened to his deposition, that he was absolutely right, that he wasn?t coordinating with us because we weren?t doing the same thing that he was doing.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	So I was upset with him that he wasn?t fully telling us about all of the meetings that he was having. And he said to me, ?but I?m briefing the president. I?m briefing chief of staff Mulvaney, I?m briefing secretary Pompeo and I?ve talked to ambassador Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with?? And the point is we have a robust interagency process that deals with Ukraine. It includes Mr. Holmes, it includes Ambassador Taylor, the [inaudible 00:34:21] in Ukraine, it includes a whole load of other people. But it struck me one yesterday when you put up on the screen ambassador Sondland?s emails and who was on these emails and he said, these the people who need to know that he was absolutely right. Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand and we were being involved in national security foreign policy. And those two things had just diverged.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	So he was correct. And I had not put my finger on that at the moment, but I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn?t fully coordinating. And I did say to him, ?Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up.? And here we are. And after I left to my next meeting, our director for the European Union talked to him much further for a full half hour or more later trying to ask him about how we could coordinate better. How all of us could coordinate better, after I had left the office. And his feeling was that the National Security Counsel was always trying to block him. What we were trying to do, was block us from straying into domestic or personal politics. And that was precisely what I was trying to do. But Ambassador Sondland is not wrong that he had been given a different remit than we had been.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	And it was at that moment that I started to realize how those things are diverged. And I realized in fact that I wasn?t really being fair to Ambassador Sondland because he was carrying out what he thought he had been instructed to carry out and we were doing something that we thought was just as, or perhaps even more important, but it wasn?t in the same channel.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	My point Mr. Nunes is that we at the National Security Council were not told either by the president directly or through Ambassador Bolton that we were to be focused on these issues as a matter of US foreign policy toward Ukraine. So when you?re talking about Ukraine in 2016, I never personally heard the president say anything specific about 2016 and Ukraine. I?ve seen him saying plenty of things publicly, but I was not given a directive. In fact, I was given a directive on July 10th by Ambassador Bolton very clearly to stay out of domestic politics.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	We?d already had a discussion with Kurt Volker, which was in the deep positions of his assistant, Chris Anderson, that indicated that he had met with Rudy Giuliani at this point. And Ambassador Sondland and made comments about meeting with Giuliani. And as we know in the May 23rd meeting, they had been instructed to meet with Giuliani. They give us every impression that they were meeting with Rudy Giuliani at this point and Rudy Giuliani was also saying on the television and indeed has said subsequently, that he was closely coordinating with the State Department. So it was my belief that they were meeting with him.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I only learned that subsequently from Ambassador Volcker?s deposition. So I just want to tell you in that particular timeframe, I was not aware of that. And in fact, Gordon Sondland did refer to Rudy Giuliani. And again, Ambassador Bolton had warned Ambassador Volker not to meet with Rudy Giuliani in a meeting.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did not relate any concerns in general terms about Colonel Vindman?s judgment. So I was somewhat surprised when I heard Mr. Morrison make that assertion. And when I read his deposition there was a very specific point that was made. And again, these are personnel issues and I?m sure that nobody here would like to have their private personnel issues put before a committee. But you?ve asked me about this. So I had a couple of very short transition meetings with Mr. Morrison. And again, Mr. Morrison did not work in our directorate. He was taking over the position, which he held for three months. I had worked as the senior director for Europe and Eurasia it was at the time, for more than two years at this point. And I?d been working for a year with Colonel Vindman with Mr. Vindman and in the course of one of the meetings, sometime in the June timeframe, I sat down with Mr. Morrison and with a deputy referred to him in his deposition, John Erath, who was also working and we went through our organizational chart.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	We went through who was staying, who was rotating out and leaving in the summer and we talked about everybody?s strengths and weaknesses. And I always ask my staff to do upward feedback as well to talk about what I wasn?t doing my tithe or I?d like to learn too. And I said that I was concerned about the way things were trending in Ukraine policy. So Colonel Vindman, is a highly distinguished, decorated military officer. He came over to us from the chairman?s office in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And we were evaluating and looking at him in the context of what his future positions would be in the context of the US Army. And I was concerned that if, for example, Colonel Vindman might decide to leave the military, that perhaps he wasn?t as well suited for something that will be much more political. I did not feel that he had the political antenna to deal with something that was straying into domestic politics.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Not everyone is suited for that. That does not mean in any way that I was questioning his overall judgment nor was I questioning in any way his substantive expertise. He is excellent on issues related to Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, on Russian defense issues, he had been in charge of the Russia campaign, thinking through at the chairman?s office and in the Pentagon. This was a very specific issue because by June, we saw that things were diverging and you needed completely different sensitivity. Some people in my office have worked at the highest levels of advisory positions and Mr. Morrison had come from Capitol Hill, he knew politics inside out. And we said that Colonel Vindman did not and we were concerned about how he would manage what was becoming a highly charged and potentially partisan issue, which had not been before.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Not with the embassy in Ukraine. I mean we did pull him back from the meeting in the oval office. And subsequently we were very concerned about these political aspects to this and we did not feel? July 10th, Colonel Vindman was justifiably alarmed when he realized that there was this highly political aspect of the meeting that we were looking for eventually with President Zelensky.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I think it?s very unfortunate. I mean, this is a country of immigrants, with the exception perhaps of very few people still here. Everyone emigrated to the United States at some point in their family history. And this is what for me, really does make America great. I mean, I?m sure that every single person here, some people perhaps came reluctantly, others came by choice as I did. But this is, for me, this is the essence of America. It?s why I wanted to be here and why I wanted to stay here and I think it?s unfair to castigate anyone. Everyone has some kind of [inaudible 00:46:54] to them. I?m an Anglo American perhaps or I?m a British American, I?m a naturalized citizen. I do not believe that my loyalty is to the United Kingdom, my loyalty is here to the United States. This is my country and the country that I serve and I know for a fact that every single one of my colleagues and there were many naturalized citizens in my office and across the National Security Council felt exactly the same way. I think it?s deeply unfair.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	And he told other people that as well to be clear.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, the reference that Ambassador Bolton made was after I returned from the Ward Room and related to him what I had heard. So there was a there the sequencing of meetings, which I know that there?s been some concern about the sequencing here and discrepancies between various depositions. So what happened immediately after the meeting that Ambassador Bolton caught a little shot, was that he told me to hold back in the room. And he was a escorting out the Ukrainian visitors along with Secretary Perry and Ambassadors Volker and Sondland. And I guess they wanted to take a quick photograph outside of his office. And I know that Secretary Perry and others have tweeted out that photograph, beautiful sunny day and there?s a picture of all of them standing just outside of Ambassador Bolton?s office. This is very quick. He came back in and at that point I guess they were already moving down to the Ward Room because on the way out of Ambassador Bolton?s office, Ambassador Sondland had said, let?s regroup in the Ward Room for a quick huddle on next steps, which to be honest, was quite unusual.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	You don?t usually huddle in a room in the White House to discuss next steps with foreign delegations. Because we took it to mean next steps on setting up the meeting, which already, as I?d said, Ambassador Bolton wasn?t prepared to do. And when Ambassador Bolton came back into the office, that?s when he gave me the very strong instruction to go downstairs, find out what was being discussed and to come right back up and report it to him. And as I came into the Ward Room, Colonel Vindman and Ambassador Sondland were in an exchange. And that?s when I noticed that Colonel Vindman looked quite alarmed. Now I know that Ambassador Sondland was asked yesterday because again, I watched all of his testimony and I watched it very carefully, that there was some questions about yelling and shouting. I certainly never said that and there was no yelling and shouting.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s some embellishment that?s crept in perhaps in media depictions or how people like to retell these stories and add things to them. When I came in, Ambassador Sondland was in an exchange with Colonel Vindman along the lines of, well we have an agreement to have this meeting. And I came in and I asked what?s going on here? And he said, and this is again the Ukrainians are there, Ambassador Volker was there, but at this point I also want to stress, Secretary Perry had left. He was not in the Ward Room when I came. As I was coming in, Secretary Perry and his colleagues were leaving. So Secretary Perry has no recollection of this meeting because he was not in it. And so when I came in, Gordon Sondland was basically saying, well look, we have a deal here that there will be a meeting. I have a deal here with the Chief of Staff Mulvaney. There will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these investigations and into 2016 in Burisma.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	And I cut it off immediately there because by this point, having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over again on the television and all of the issues that he was asserting by this point, it was clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens because Giuliani was laying it out there. I could see why Colonel Vindman was alarmed. And he said, this is inappropriate. We?re the National Security Council, we can?t be involved in this. And I?ve learned since from Mr. Holmes? rendition here today, that Colonel Vindman has already warned the Ukrainians or in fact President Zelensky no less to stay out of American politics, domestic politics. So I cut off this line and I said to Ambassador Sondland, look, we need procedures for here.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Ambassador Bolton just made it clear we can?t set up the meeting right now. We have to properly prepare this through the proper process. I know this sounds all very boring but we have a national security procedures to do this. And I said, we really shouldn?t be litigating this or talking about this in front of our colleagues from Ukraine. It was completely inappropriate for us to be thrashing this out in front of them. And he agreed and we asked our Ukrainian colleagues to move into the corridor outside the Ward Room and I explained where this is in the deposition. Which is also extraordinary awkward because they shouldn?t have been standing around in a corridor in the basically in West Wing at this particular juncture. And that?s when I pushed back on Ambassador Sondland and said, look, I know there?s differences about whether one, we should have this meeting.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	We?re trying to figure out whether we should have it after the Ukrainian democratic, sorry, parliamentary elections, the [inaudible 00:52:33] elections, which by that point I think had been set for July 21st. It must have been, because this is July 10th at this point. And Ambassador Bolton would like to wait until after that to basically see whether President Zelensky gets the majority in the parliament, which would enable him to form a cabinet and then we can move forward. And Ambassador Sondland then said, okay, fair enough. He realized he wasn?t going to be able to push this further. Ambassador Volker didn?t say anything at this particular juncture. and then he said he had another meeting and they all left. And I went back up and relate this to Ambassador Bolton, which is when he gave me the very specific instruction that we?ve already been through to go to talk to Mr. Eisenberg, John Eisenberg in the NSC counsel?s office.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Sorry, that was a long answer.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I don?t.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I might?ve missed that.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It?s not. No.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I brought with me two exhibits that I was pointed to in fact, by our colleagues, during the deposition that I gave on October 14th. And actually I?m quite grateful that they pointed me in this direction. I was presented, during my deposition, with two articles, or at least two pieces of information. One was a op ed that the Ukrainian Ambassador Charlie wrote in 2016 in the Hill. So this is during the presidential campaign when President Trump was then the nominee for the Republican Party. And this is Ambassador Charlie who was then, still the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States being critical of President Trump, who was then the nominee for the Republican Party for making comments about Ukraine, Crimea and Russia.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct. And he just uses this as a peg because to be honest, the whole article is actually about Ukraine. And this is classic standard for anyone who wants to write an op ed, I?ve written plenty of them myself, you pick a peg by something that you or somebody else might?ve said and then you proceed to say what you want to say.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	So this is what Ambassador Charlie does, is he talks about Ukraine?s position vis a vis Russia and Russian aggression against Ukraine.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I would say that it?s probably not the most advisable thing to do for an ambassador because you never know who?s going to win. And I think that the second piece that was presented to me at great length, and I want to thank Mr. Costa for making me go back and read it again because when you asked me the questions about it, I did remember the piece. Kenneth Vogel is a very well-known and as you?ve pointed out, extremely good journalist, and I?d remembered reading this back in the day in January of 2017 but it?d been a long time between then and October. And you gave me a copy and I went back and read it again. Because I think it actually is extraordinary important, it gets to this issue here. Mr. Vogel points out that the Ukrainian government, again, they wouldn?t have done very well at the [inaudible 00:32:11], I?m picking up the issue I pointed out at the beginning of today, they bet on the wrong horse.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	They bet on Hillary Clinton winning the election. And so they were trying to carry favor with the Clinton campaign, it?s quite evident here. And he relates to some extent, individuals and some Ukrainian officials like Mr. Avakov, the Interior Minister and a number of other people that he names here and that have been named at various points. And talks about how they were trying to collect information as a ranking member Nunes said on Mr. Manafort and on other people as well. However, I do want to point out that the crux of the article here by Mr. Vogel, as he said, there was little evidence of a top-down effort by Ukraine. And he makes a distinction between the Russian effort that was personally directed by Russian President Putin and involve the country?s military-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	? personally directed by Russian President Putin and involve the country?s military and foreign intelligence services. Now, I don?t think that those two things are exactly the same. I also mentioned in my deposition of October 14th that in fact many officials for many countries, including Ukraine, bet on the wrong horse. They believe that Secretary Clinton, former Senator Clinton, former First Lady Clinton was going to win. Many said some pretty disparaging and hurtful things about President Trump, and I can?t blame him for feeling aggrieved about them. And when we were setting up head of state visits ? And remember, I have a portfolio of 50 plus countries plus NATO and the European Union ? we thought it prudent to collect as much as possible about comments that people might?ve said about the president during the campaign, when he was either one of the candidates to be the nominee for the Republican party or when he was actually the candidate running against Hillary Clinton.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I?m sorry to say that an awful lot, and perhaps I shouldn?t name them here because it will have consequences, an awful lot of senior officials in many governments, including our allied governments, said some pretty hurtful things about the president. I would also personally take offense at some of the things that were said if I were the president. Now, the difference here, however, is that that hasn?t had any major impact on his feelings towards those countries. Not that I have seen. But I?ve also heard the president say ? And he said it in public, so I?m not revealing any kind of executive privilege here ? that Ukraine tried to take me down.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	What I have seen [inaudible 01:07:40] ill-advised Ukrainian officials ? Ambassador Charlie?s been removed as being the ambassador from here ? made some pretty, you know, unpleasant statements or ill-advised op-eds. But I could list a whole host of ambassadors from allied countries who tweeted out, who had public comments about the president as well, and it did not affect security assistance, having meetings with them. If it would, there?d been a lot of people he wouldn?t have met with.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I have the highest regard for Ambassador Yovanovitch, both in terms of her integrity and the high standards of work that she was carrying out as ambassador in Ukraine and across her whole career. I do believe that there was a smear campaign. I just want to say again for the record that I think it was unnecessary. If there was a decision to have a political ambassador put in place in Ukraine, that would be perfectly acceptable. It?s exactly the right of the president to be able to do that. I did just did not see why it was necessary to malign Ambassador Yovanovitch to such an extent.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	He did, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	What he meant by this was pretty clear to me in the context of all of the statements that Mr. Giuliani was making publicly, that the investigations that he was promoting, that the storyline he was promoting, the narrative he was promoting was going to backfire. I think it has backfired.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	At the particular juncture that Ambassador Bolton made that comment, absolutely, because that was in the context of my discussions with him about what was happening to Ambassador Yovanovitch.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I honestly don?t know what the definition of a never Trumper is, as I think many of my colleagues are feeling the same way. That is a puzzling term to be applied to career or nonpartisan officials. I chose to come into the administration. I could easily have said no when I was approached [crosstalk 01:17:50] ?
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I guess, unfortunately, where we are today in America that?s coming with the territory. They?re continuing, honestly. I mean, we?re constantly having to block Twitter posts of my name and address on the internet. We?ve been doing this over the last couple of days.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	And as I said in my deposition, this could happen to any single person in this room, be it members of the press, be it members of Congress, and be at the staff. I think we have to find ways of combating this. And again, this gets back sadly to things that our adversaries can also exploit.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It should not.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I am, and I think that all of my colleagues are as well because, just as you said, we can?t let this stand. I don?t think anyone here wants to let this stand. I actually don?t believe that this is a partisan issue. I don?t think anybody wants to come under personal attack.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	The first part of it was, except the last paragraph.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Because at this juncture, it had become quite apparent that the president wasn?t very keen on having a meeting with Mr. Zelensky, for all the reasons that we?ve been trying to lay out today. Once one puts in a letter like that, you raise the expectation of an invitation coming shortly.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, again, as we?ve all made clear, Ambassador Yovanovitch, and you saw for yourselves in her deposition, is a person of great integrity. She?s one of our finest foreign service officers, career foreign service officers. And if it had been a decision to remove her to replace her with a political appointee, again, that was perfectly within the rights of the president. Sometimes, it?s highly advisable, in fact, to emphasize to a country just exactly how close the relationship is likely to be, to have an appointee who is close to the president if it?s an important relationship.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	But what was dispiriting was all of the accusations that were being fired at Ambassador Yovanovitch, leading her to be tweeted, including by members of the president?s family. We all firmly believe that Mr. Giuliani and others, including the people who were recently indicted, the Ukrainian-American gentleman, had for some reason decided that Ambassador Yovanovitch was some kind of personal problem for them and that they had then decided to engage in just the kinds of things we?ve been discussing about. And frankly, she was an easy target as a woman. I?m very sorry to hear about what?s happened to Congressman Stefanik, and I think that this just illustrates the point and the problem that we?re dealing with here today.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct. That was in 2017.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I?m not, no.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Thank you, sir.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Could I actually say something? Because we?ve had three [crosstalk 01:33:03] ?
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	No, I think that what Dr. Wenstrup said was very powerful, about the importance of overcoming hatred and certainly partisan division. It?s unfortunate that Congressmen Turner and Ratcliffe have both left as well, because I think all of us who came here under a legal obligation also felt we had a moral obligation to do so. We came as fact witnesses. When I was referring to questions that I?d heard, it was in the context of the deposition that I gave on October 14th, because I was very worried about the turn in which some of the questions were taking. And I understand that the point has been reared about individuals, as you?ve just said, Dr. Wenstrup, and that these articles lay out, taking different positions in our elections.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I don?t believe there should be any interference of any kind in our election. I think it was unfair for people to already call the election and to make attacks, also, on candidate Trump and on President Trump. I know that this has put a huge cloud over this presidency and also over our whole democratic system. That?s actually why as a nonpartisan person and as an expert on Russia and an expert on Vladimir Putin and on the Russian security services, I wanted to come in to serve the country to try to see if I could help.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I heard President Trump say that he wanted to improve the relations with Russia. I believe we have to. We can?t be in this unending confrontation with Russia. We have to find a way to stabilize that relationship and to professionalize that relationship as well as to stop them from doing what they did in 2016 again in 2020. This is really the crux of the issue that I and others are trying to put across, and I think that you?ve put across very eloquently. The other matters related to this inquiry, we?re here just to provide what we know and what we?ve heard. I understand that for many members, this may be hearsay. I?ve talked about things I heard with my own ears.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I understand that Ambassador Sondland has said a lot of things. I?ve told you what he told me and what others told me. A lot of other people have said things to me again as well and also to Mr. Holmes. We?re here to relate to you what we heard, what we saw, and what we did, and to be of some help to all of you in really making a very momentous decision here. We are not the people who make that decision. And I do again want to underscore what you said here, Dr. Wenstrup. It was very eloquent and very moving about your service and trying to bring us all together again as Americans. We need to be together again in 2020 so the American people can make a choice about the future and make their vote in a presidential election without any fear that this is being interfered in from any quarter whatsoever. So I just want to thank you for making what I think was also a very elegant and eloquent and heartfelt defense.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It is a true story. I was a bit surprised to see that pop up today. It?s one of the stories I occasionally tell because it had some very unfortunate consequences afterwards. My mother gave me a bowl haircut. So for the school photograph later in that week, I looked like Richard III or as if I?m going to be in a permanent [crosstalk 01:37:14] ?
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Not that I had been told of.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	So I was led to understand, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	So I was led to understand. Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, I think I already laid that out in only a part of a response to some of the questions. We were actually conducting, which for a lot of the American people might seem to be a rather boring standard bilateral policy towards Ukraine, pushing them on issues of reform in the energy sector, and more broadly we were concerned obviously about corruption in Ukraine. We were trying to help Ukraine regain its sovereignty after the attacks by Russia.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, we basically had worked out over a course of two years and in close conjunction with the embassy in Kiev, an interim agency agreed action plan. These are things that in fact Colonel Vindman and others were working on, basically moving forward on the various issues that were on the list of items. Clearly Rudy Giuliani and other people didn?t care at all about this.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Frankly, Ambassador Sondland wasn?t particularly interested in it either. It?s quite boring. It wouldn?t make for good copy in the press. And it?s the kind of thing that everybody on a routine moves forward on.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct, sir, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	He is, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did go to see him.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I basically gave him the same summary that I?ve given to you on the 10th of July.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Of what took place. Correct. Including some of the details that I shared with you as well, the sequencing and what transpired as I was walking in.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	He did not have a great deal of time on the 10th, and I gave him the quick summary. We agreed that we would meet again on the 11th, on July 11th the next day. And I also wanted to bring in with me my colleague, Wells Griffith, who was senior director for energy who?d been sitting with me on the sofa for the first portion of the meeting. And I also suggested that he speak to Colonel Vindman separately as well, because Colonel Vindman was in the wardroom when I arrived and had obviously been engaged in some discussion before I got there, because as as I got into the room, they were clearly in the course of ? sorry with the microphone ? clearly in the course of conversation. I thought it was important for John Eisenberg to hear from Colonel Vindman himself, what his recollections of the meeting were.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I certainly did. The first thing I related to him was exactly and precisely what Ambassador Bolton had asked me to.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Mr. Eisenberg took it all very seriously. He said, for example, that Colonel Vindman should feel free ? He said this to me ? in future to go and bring any concerns to him about these meetings. Similarly myself and any others, if there was any subsequent followup in terms of these issues being raised again with any of the parties in the future.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	No, he did not. He listened very carefully to all of the information that we imparted.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Mr. Danyliuk, [inaudible 01:48:51], Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and then a couple of people I think were from the State Department.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I wondered for a while if one of Secretary Perry?s group had been there too, but I honestly cannot remember.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	He was there, but he didn?t actually speak very much during that meeting. I heard his deposition, and I read his deposition where he didn?t really recall that encounter. Again, he didn?t really speak. Ambassador Sondland was doing most of the speaking.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, at the time Mr. Yermak was quite impassive. I said that he had an aide with him, and his aide was sitting next to him in the original meeting with Ambassador Bolton and was from time to time ? actually he was on this side ? whispering to him.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	So I wasn?t sure myself, because I had not met Mr. Yermak before, about how good his English was. So I wasn?t sure. Perhaps Mr. Holmes might be able to reflect on that as to whether he was having some points of clarification from the aide.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Yeah, so I wasn?t entirely sure if he was following all of the back-and-forth. Mr. Danylyuk, who I know very well and speaks very good English, looked quite alarmed. I think he was more alarmed at the fact that there was this back-and-forth between Ambassador Sondland and Colonel Vindman, than with me about the meeting. They very much wanted to have this meeting, and here are some U.S. officials arguing about the meeting in front of him, and that was obviously very uncomfortable for him.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That is correct. Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Actually, I was still technically on the payroll of the NSC until the end of August, August 30th of 2019, but I was not physically in the building, and I?d handed over my duties to Mr. Morrison.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I was not on the call. That is absolutely correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Not for that call, but let me just say for the record that there had been a long anticipation that eventually there would be a call, so there was a call package that was prepared in advance. I just cannot say how much of that call package that had perhaps been prepared since, for example, the inauguration of President Zelensky was then used as the basic material for that call. So I did take part in the preparation of that standard call package, but I did not take part in any preparation for the specific call on July 25th.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That is correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That is correct, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That is correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That is correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Correct. Ultimately.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	They did.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct, based on what Ambassador Sondland said in the wardroom.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It?s not really evidence. And look, I want to be very clear about this. I was asked a question about this in my deposition. I did not raise it. And to be honest, I was surprised that I was asked the question.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did, but again, it was in passing, and I explained the circumstances in which it came up. But I was asked a question in the course of my deposition about it.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That was the only person that I could think of.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I actually only found that out after the fact. I wondered why I was being asked about him, so I went to look this up.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I have heard his name, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I am aware of those reports, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I am not aware of that.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It?s a very bad precedent.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Yes, it does.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I would agree with you, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	In the tense that Americans should be paying attention that RT and other outlets are used to propagate this kind of information, absolutely. I wasn?t quite sure what you meant about should be paying attention-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct. And actually I?d like to point out that in November 2011, I actually sat next to Vladimir Putin at a conference in which he made precisely that point. It was the first time that he had actually done so to a group of American journalists and experts who were brought to something called the Valdai Discussion Club. So he started in 2011 making it very clear that he saw American fracking as a great threat to Russian interests. We were all struck by how much he stressed this issue and it?s since 2011, and since that particular juncture, that Putin has made a big deal of this.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Yes, I thought it was a rabbit hole.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That is fair, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s [inaudible 02:34:18]. Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	No, that?s not? That?s correct, it was not a policy disagreement-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I?m sorry. Yes, it?s not correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That was the first time. I?ve self-instructed a couple of times, but that was the first time I have been instructed to go.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, he clearly wanted to have himself on the record as not being part of what was basically an agreement to have a meeting in return for investigations. And he wanted to make sure that I, and Colonel Vindman, were also not part of this as well, because remember, there was a [inaudible 02:35:28] to this about not getting involved in domestic politics.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did because July 10th is really the first time that it crystallized for me that there was basically a different channel going on here-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	? a foreign policy channel and a domestic policy channel and we?re not in that other channel.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It was improper and it was inappropriate, and we said that in the time, in real time.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	He didn?t put it in that way and I think from listening to him and his depositions and in what I?ve read of what he deposed, he made it very clear that he was surprised that we had some kind of objection. You may remember that in his deposition and when he was here, he actually didn?t remember the meeting in the same way because clearly-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It was obvious to me, correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Yes, it was.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It?s not credible to me at all that he was oblivious to this.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It is not credible to me that he was oblivious. He did not say ?Bidens,? however, he just said ?Burisma.? He said ?2016? and I took it to mean the elections as well as Burisma.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, we?ve had this experience before and I just want you to indulge me for a moment. In 2008, Russia also attacked the country of Georgia. I was the National Intelligence Officer at that particular juncture and we had warned, in multiple documents, to the highest levels of government that we believed that there was a real risk of a conflict between Georgia and Russia. And in fact, we also believed, at that point, that Russia might attack Ukraine. This was in 2008 when both Georgia and Ukraine sought a membership action plan in NATO, and Russia threatened them openly that if they proceeded with their requests for NATO membership, that there would be consequences.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	In the wake of the attack on Georgia, President Putin made it clear to the President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, at the time, and this was related to me at the highest levels of the Georgian government that Putin had said directly to Saakashvili, ?Your Western allies, your Western partners, promised a great deal. They didn?t deliver. I threatened, I delivered.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	We had made all kinds of promises to Georgia and Ukraine in that timeframe and we didn?t come through. So Putin is always looking out to see if there is any hint that we will not follow through on promises that we have made because he will always follow through on a threat. As indeed, he ultimately did. He threatened Ukraine in 2008, and it wasn?t until 2014, when Ukraine tried to conclude an association agreement with the European Union, that he struck, but he had been threatening this for the whole period since 2008.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I don?t think he was a convicted felon at the time that he launched this, so I didn?t use those exact words, but it was indeed Roger Stone-
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	But it was indeed Alex Jones on Infowars in 2017. And in fact, just more recently before Mr. Stone endured his trial, they were at it again reprising the same Infowars video and adding embellishments.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I think my coal mining family would be very surprised to hear all of these things about me.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Actually leftist, perhaps not so much, but anyway, the left in Europe is a bit different from the left here, let?s put it that way.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did say that, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I did say that, yes.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	Well, certainly when they involve George Soros, they do. I?d just like to point out that in the early 1900s, the Tsarist Secret Police produced something called The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which actually you can still obtain on the internet, and you can buy it, actually sometimes in bookshops in Russia and elsewhere. This is the longest-running anti-Semitic trope that we have in history. And the trope against Mr. Soros, George Soros, was also created for political purposes, and this is the new Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I?d actually intended to write something about this before I was actually invited to come into the administration, because it?s an absolute outrage.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I?m not even sure I know who they were, so the answer?s no.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I think that?s correct, and that?s, as I said in my deposition on October 14th, that frankly, that?s what I thought it was at the very beginning when I first heard Mr. Giuliani making these statements.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	I do know Mr. Firtash, that?s correct. I know of him from my work, that?s correct.
2019-11-21	Fiona Hill	W-Hill	W-Hill	It certainly appears that it is being used, that there?s a subversion of American foreign policy to push these people?s personal interests.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Thank you. Good morning Mr. chairman, Ranking Member Nunes, and members of the Committee. My name is David Holmes, and I?m a career Foreign Service Officer with the Department of State. Since August 2017, I have been a political counselor at the US Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine. While it is an honor to appear before you today, I want to make clear that I did not seek this opportunity to testify today. Since you determined that I may have something of value to these proceedings and issued a subpoena, it is my obligation?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	? something of value to these proceedings and issued a subpoena. It is my obligation to appear and to tell you what I know. Indeed, as secretary Pompeo has stated, I hope everyone who testifies will do so truthfully and accurately. When they do, the oversight role will have been performed, and I think America will come to see what took place here. That is my only goal, to testify truthfully and accurately to enable you to perform that role. To that end, I have put together this statement to lay out as best I can, my recollection of events that may be relevant to this matter.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	By way of background, I have spent my entire professional career as a foreign service officer. Like many of the dedicated public servants who have testified in these proceedings, my entire career has been in the service of my country. I?m a graduate of Pomona College in Claremont, California and received degrees in international affairs from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and from Princeton University?s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I joined the foreign service in 2002 through an apolitical merit-based process under the George W. Bush administration, and I have proudly served administrations of both parties and worked for their appointees, both political and career. Prior to my current post in Kiev, Ukraine, I served in the political and economic sections at the US embassy in Moscow, Russia. In Washington, I served on the national security council staff as director for Afghanistan and as a special assistant to the Under Secretary of State.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	My prior overseas assignments include New Delhi, India, Kabul, Afghanistan, Bogota, Colombia, and Pristina, Kosovo. As the political counselor at the US NBC Embassy in Kiev, I lead the political section covering Ukraine?s internal politics, foreign relations and security policies. I serve as the senior policy and political ambassador to the advisor to the ambassador.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The job of an embassy political counselor is to gather information about the host country?s political landscape, to report back to Washington, to represent US policies to foreign contacts, and to advise the ambassador on policy development and implementation. In this role, I?m a senior member of the embassy?s country team and continually involved in addressing issues as they arise. I?m also often called upon to take notes in meetings involving the ambassador or visiting senior US officials with Ukrainian counterparts.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	For this reason, I?ve been present in many of the meetings with President Zelensky and his administration, some of which may be germane to this inquiry. While I?m a political counselor at the embassy, it is important to note that I am not a political appointee or engage in US politics in any way. It is not my job to cover or advise on US politics. On the contrary, I?m an apolitical foreign policy professional, and my job is to focus on the politics of the country in which I serve, so that we can better understand the local landscape and better advance US national interests there.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	In fact, during the period that we?ll cover today, my colleagues and I followed direct guidance from Ambassador Yovanovitch and Ambassador Taylor to focus on doing our jobs as foreign policy professionals and to stay clear of Washington politics. I arrived in Kiev to take up my assignment as political counselor in August, 2017, a year after Ambassador Yovanovitch received her appointment. From August, 2017 until her removal from post in May, 2019, I was Ambassador Yovanovitch?s chief policy advisor and developed a deep respect for her dedication, determination, decency and professionalism.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	During this time, we worked together closely, speaking multiple times per day, and I accompanied Ambassador Yovanovitch to many of her meetings with senior Ukrainian counterparts. Our work in Ukraine focused on three policy priorities: peace and security, economic growth and reform, and anticorruption and rule of law. These policies match the three consistent priorities of the Ukrainian peoples since 2014, as measured in public opinion polling, namely an end to the conflict with Russia that restores national unity and territorial integrity, responsible economic policies that deliver European standards of growth and opportunity, and effective and impartial rule of law institutions that deliver justice in cases of high level official corruption.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Our efforts on this third policy priority merit special mention because it was during Ambassador Yovanovitch?s tenure that we achieved the hard-fought passage of a law establishing an independent court to try corruption cases. These efforts strained Ambassador Yovanovitch?s relationship with former president Poroshenko and some of his allies, including Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, who resisted fully empowering truly independent anti-corruption institutions that would help ensure that no Ukrainians, however powerful, were above the law. Despite this resistance, the ambassador in the embassy kept pushing anticorruption and other priorities of our policy towards Ukraine.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Beginning in March, 2019 the situation at the embassy and in Ukraine changed dramatically. Specifically, the three priorities of security, economy and justice, and our support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression became overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	That change began with the emergence of press reports, critical of Ambassador Yovanovitch and machinations by then-Prosecutor General Lutsenko and others to discredit her. In mid-March, 2019, an embassy colleague learned from a Ukrainian contact that Mr. Lutsenko had complained that Ambassador Yovanovitch had ?destroyed him? with her refusal to support him until he followed through with his reform commitments and ceased using his position for personal gain.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	In retaliation. Mr. Lutsenko made a series of unsupported allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch, mostly suggesting that Ambassador Yovanovitch improperly used the embassy to advance the political interests of the democratic party. Among Mr. Lutsenko?s allegations were that the embassy had ordered the investigation of a former Ukrainian official solely because that former official was allegedly the main Ukrainian contact of the Republican Party and of president Trump personally, and that the embassy had allegedly pressured Lutsenko?s predecessor to close a case against a different former Ukrainian official solely because of an alleged connection between that official?s company Burisma and former Vice President Biden?s son.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Mr. Lutsenko also claimed that he had never received $4.4 million in US funds intended for his office, and that there was a tape of a Ukrainian official saying that he was trying to help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election. Finally, Mr. Lutsenko publicly claimed that Ambassador Yovanovitch had given him a ?do not prosecute? list containing the names of her supposed allies, an allegation the State Department called an outright fabrication and that Mr. Lutsenko later retracted.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Mr. Lutsenko said that as a result of these allegations, Ambassador Yovanovitch would face serious problems in the United States. Public opinion polls indicated that Ukrainians generally did not believe Mr. Lutsenko?s allegations, and on March 22nd, President Poroshenko issued a statement in support of Ambassador Yovanovitch. Following Mr. Lutsenko?s allegations, Mr. Giuliani and others made a number of public statements critical of Ambassador Yovanovitch, questioning her integrity and calling for her removal from office. Mr Giuliani was also making frequent public statements pushing for Ukraine to investigate interference in the 2016 election and issues related to Burisma and the Bidens.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	For example, on May 1st, 2019 The New York times reported that Mr. Giuliani had discussed the Burisma investigation and its intersection with the Bidens with the ousted Ukrainian Prosecutor General and the current prosecutor. On May 9th, The New York times reported that Mr. Giuliani said he planned to travel to Ukraine to pursue investigations into the 2016 election interference and into the involvement of former Vice President Biden?s son in a Ukrainian gas company.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Over the next few months, Mr. Giuliani also issued a series of tweets asking ?why Biden shouldn?t be investigated, attacking ?the new president of Ukraine Zelensky for being silent on the 2016 election and Biden investigations and complaining about The New York times attacking him for ?exposing the Biden family history of making millions from Ukrainian criminals.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Around this time, the Ukrainian presidential election was approaching, and political newcomer and entertainer Volodymyr Zelensky, who had played a president on television, was surging in the polls, ahead of Mr. Lutsenko?s political ally, President Poroshenko. On April 20th, I was present for Ambassador Yovanovitch?s third and final meeting with then-candidate Zelensky ahead of his landslide victory in the runoff election the next day. As in her two prior meetings that I also attended, they had an entirely cordial, pleasant conversation and signaled their mutual desire to work together.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	However, the negative narratives about Ambassador Yovanovitch had gained currency in certain segments of the United States press. On April 26th, Ambassador Yovanovitch departed for Washington DC, where she learned that she would be recalled early. The barrage of allegations directed at Ambassador Yovanovitch, a career ambassador, is unlike anything I?ve seen in my professional career. Following President Elect Zelensky?s victory, our attention in the embassy focused on getting to know the incoming Zelensky administration and on preparations for the inauguration scheduled for May 20th, the same day that Ambassador Yovanovitch departed post permanently.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	It quickly became clear that the White House was not prepared to show the level of support for the Zelensky administration that we had originally anticipated. In early May, Mr. Giuliani publicly alleged that Mr. Zelensky was ?surrounded by enemies of the US president? and canceled a visit to Ukraine. Shortly thereafter, we learned that Vice President Pence no longer planned to lead the presidential delegation to the inauguration.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The White House then whittled down an initial proposed list for the official presidential delegation to the inauguration from over a dozen individuals to just five. Secretary Perry as its head, Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, representing the State Department. National Security Council Director Alex Vindman, representing the White House, temporary acting Charge d?Affaires, Joseph Pennington, representing the embassy, and ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	While Ambassador Sondland?s mandate as the accredited ambassador to the European Union did not cover individual member states, let alone non-member countries like Ukraine, he made clear that he had direct and frequent access to President Trump and Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and portrayed himself as the conduit to the President and Mr. Mulvaney for this group. Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker later styled themselves the Three Amigos and made clear they would take the lead on coordinating our policy and engagement with the Zelensky administration.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Around the same time, I became aware that Mr. Giuliani, a private lawyer, was taking a direct role in Ukrainian diplomacy. On April 25th, Ivan Bakanov, who was Mr. Zelensky?s childhood friend and campaign chair, and was ultimately appointed as the head of the security services of Ukraine, indicated to me privately that he had been contacted by ?someone named Giuliani who said he was an advisor to the Vice President.? I reported Mr. Bakanov?s message to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Over the following months, it became apparent that Mr. Giuliani was having a direct influence on the foreign policy agenda that the Three Amigos were executing on the ground in Ukraine. In fact, at one point during a preliminary meeting of the inaugural delegation, someone wondered aloud why Mr. Giuliani was so active in the media with respect to Ukraine. My recollection is that Ambassador Sondland stated, ?Dammit, Rudy. Every time Rudy gets involved, he goes and F?s everything up.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The inauguration took place on May 20th, and I took notes in the delegations meeting with President Zelensky. During the meeting, Secretary Perry passed President Zelensky a list that Perry described as ?people he trusts.? Secretary Perry told President Zelensky that he could seek advice from the people on this list on issues of energy sector reform, which was the topic of subsequent meetings between Secretary Perry and key Ukrainian energy sector contacts. Embassy personnel were excluded from some of these later meetings by Secretary Perry?s staff.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	On May 23rd, Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron Johnson, who had also attended the inauguration, though not on the official delegation, returned to the United States and briefed President Trump. On May 29th, President Trump signed a congratulatory letter to President Zelensky, which included an invitation to visit the White House at an unspecified date. It is important to understand that a White House visit was critical to President Zelensky. President Zelensky needed to show US support at the highest levels in order to demonstrate to Russian President Putin that he had United States backing, as well as to advance his ambitious anticorruption reform agenda at home.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	President Zelensky?s team immediately began pressing to set a date for that visit. President Zelensky and senior members of his team made clear that they wanted President Zelensky?s first overseas trip to be to Washington to send a strong signal of American support and requested a call with President Trump as soon as possible. We at the embassy also believed that a meeting was critical to the success of President Zelensky?s administration and its reform agenda, and we worked hard to get it arranged.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	When President Zelensky?s team did not receive a confirmed date for a White House visit, they made alternative plans for President Zelensky?s first overseas trip to be to Brussels instead, in part two attend an American Independence Day event Ambassador Sondland hosted on June 4th. Ambassador Sondland hosted a dinner in President Zelensky?s honor following the reception, which included President Zelensky, Jared Kushner, Secretary Pompeo?s counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, senior European Union officials, and comedian Jay Leno, among others.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Ambassador Bill Taylor arrived in Kiev as Charg??Affaires on June 17th. For the next month, a focus of our activities along with those of the Three Amigos, was to coordinate a White House visit. To that end, we were working with Ukrainians to deliver things that we thought President Trump might care about, such as commercial deals that would benefit the United States, which might convince President Trump to agree to a meeting with President Zelensky.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The Ukrainian policy community was unanimous in its recommendation in recognizing the importance of securing the meeting and President Trump?s support. Ambassador Taylor reported that Secretary Pompeo had told him prior to his arrival in Kiev, ?We need to work on turning The President around on Ukraine.? Ambassador Volker told us that the next five years could hang on what could be accomplished in the next three months. I took that to mean that if we did not earn President Trump?s support in the next three months, we could lose the opportunity to make progress during President?s Zelensky?s five year term.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Within a week or two, it became apparent that the energy sector reforms, the commercial deals, and the anticorruption efforts on which we were making progress were not making a dent in terms of persuading the White House to schedule a meeting between the presidents. On June 27th, Ambassador Sondland told Ambassador Taylor in a phone conversation, the gist of which Ambassador Taylor shared with me at the time, that President Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that President Zelensky was not standing in the way of ?investigations.? I understood that this meant the Biden Burisma investigations that Mr. Giuliani and his associates had been speaking about in the media since March.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	While Ambassador Taylor did not brief me on every detail of his communications with the Three Amigos, he did tell me that on a June 28th call with President Zelensky, Ambassador Taylor, and the Three Amigos, it was made clear that some action on Burisma by an investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office visit. Also on June 28th, while President Trump was still not moving forward on a meeting with President Zelensky, we met with ? He met with Russian President Putin at the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, sending a further signal of lack of support to Ukraine.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	We became concerned that even if a meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky could occur, it would not go well, and I discussed with embassy colleagues whether we should stop seeking a meeting altogether. While the White House visit was critical to the Zelensky administration, a visit that failed to send a clear and strong signal of support likely would be worse for President Zelensky than no visit at all.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Congress has appropriated $1.5 billion in security assistance for Ukraine since 2014. This assistance has provided crucial material and moral support to Ukraine in its defensive war with Russia and has helped Ukraine build its armed forces virtually from scratch into arguably the most capable and battle-hardened land force in Europe. I?ve had the honor of visiting the main training facility in Western Ukraine with members of Congress and members of this very committee, Ms. Stefanik, where we witnessed firsthand US National Guard troops, along with allies, conducting training for Ukrainian soldiers.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Since 2014, National Guard units from California, Oklahoma, New York, Tennessee, and Wisconsin have trained shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainian counterparts. Given the history of US security assistance to Ukraine and the bipartisan recognition of its importance, I was shocked when on July 18th, an office of management and budget staff members surprisingly announced the hold on Ukraine?s security assistance. The announcement came toward the end of a nearly two hour National Security Council secure video conference call, which I participated in from the embassy conference room.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The official said that the order had come from the president and had been conveyed to OMB by Mr. Mulvaney with no further explanation. This began a week or so of efforts by various agencies to identify the rationale for the freeze, to conduct a review of the assistance, and to reaffirm the unanimous view of Ukraine policy community of its important. NSC counterparts confirmed to us that there had been no change in our Ukraine policy but could not determine the cause of the hold or how to lift it.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	On July 25th, President Trump made a congratulatory phone phone call to President Zelensky after his party won a commanding majority in Ukraine?s parliamentary election. Contrary to standard procedure, the embassy received no readout of that call, and I was unaware of what was discussed until the transcript was released on September 25th. Upon reading the transcript, I was deeply disappointed to see that the President raised none of what I understood to be our inner agency agreed-upon foreign policy priorities in Ukraine and instead raised the Biden Burisma investigation and referred to the theory about CrowdStrike and its supposed connection to Ukraine in the 2016 election.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The next day, July 26th, 2019, I attended meetings at the presidential administration building in Kiev with Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Sondland, and I took notes during those meetings. Our first meeting was with President Zelensky?s chief of staff. It was brief, as he had already been summoned by President Zelensky to prepare for a subsequent broader meeting. But he did say that President Trump had expressed interest during the previous day?s phone call and President Zelensky?s personnel decisions related to the Prosecutor General?s office.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The delegation then met with President Zelensky and several other senior officials. During the meeting, President Zelensky stated that during the July 25th call, President Trump had ?three times, raised some very sensitive issues? and that he would have to follow up. He, Zelensky, would have to follow up on those issues when he and President Trump met in person. Not having received a readout of the July 25th call, I did not know at the time what those sensitive issues were. After the meeting with President Zelensky, Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Taylor quickly left the presidential administration building for a trip to the front lines. Ambassador Sondland, who was to fly out that afternoon, stayed behind to have a meeting with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to President Zelensky.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	As I was leaving the meeting with President Zelensky, I was told to join the meeting with Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Yermak to take notes. I had not expected to join that meeting and it was a flight of stairs behind Ambassador Sondland as he headed to meet with Mr. Yermak. When I reached Mr. Yermak?s office, Ambassador Sondland had already gone into the meeting. I explained to Mr. Yermak?s assistant that I was supposed to join the meeting as the embassy?s representative and strongly urge her to let me in, but she told me that Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Yermak had insisted that the meeting be one-on-one with no note-taker.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I then waited in the ante room until the meeting ended, along with a member of Ambassador Sondland?s staff and a member of the US embassy Kiev staff. When the meeting ended, the two staffers and I accompanied Ambassador Sondland out of the presidential administration building. Ambassador Sondland said that he wanted to go to lunch, and I told him that I?d be happy to join him and the two staffers for lunch if he wanted to brief me out on his meeting with Mr. Yermak or discuss other issues, and Ambassador Sondland said that I should join.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The four of us went to a nearby restaurant and sat on an outdoor terrace. I sat directly across from Ambassador Sondland, and the two staffers sat off to our sides. At first, the lunch was largely social. Ambassador Sondland selected a bottle of wine that he shared among the four of us, and we discussed topics such as marketing strategies for his hotel business. During the lunch, Ambassador Sondland said that he was going to call President Trump to give him an update.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Ambassador Sondland placed a call on his mobile phone, and I heard him announce himself several times along the lines of Gordon Sondland holding for the President. It appeared that he was being transferred through several layers of switchboards and assistance, and I then noticed Ambassador Sondland?s demeanor changed and understood that he had been connected to President Trump. While Ambassador Sondland?s phone was not on speaker phone, I could hear the president?s voice through the ear piece of the phone.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The President?s voice was loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume. I heard Ambassador Sondland greet the President and explained he was calling from Kiev. I heard President Trump then clarify that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine and went on to state that President Zelensky ?loves your ass.? I then heard President Trump ask, ?So he?s going to do the investigation?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Ambassador Sondland replied that, ?He?s going to do it,? adding that ?President Zelensky will do anything you ask him to do.? Even though I did not take notes of these statements, I have a clear recollection.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Even though I did not take notes of these statements, I have a clear recollection that these statements were made. I believe that my colleagues who were sitting at the table also knew that Ambassador Sondland was speaking with the president.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The conversation then shifted to Ambassador Sondland?s efforts on behalf of the president to assist a rapper who was jailed in Sweden. I can only hear Ambassador Sondland?s side of the conversation. Ambassador Sondland told the president that the rapper was quote, ?Kind of eff?d there and should have pled guilty.? He recommended that the president, ?Wait until after the sentencing or it will only make it worse.? He added that the president should, ?Let him get sentenced, play the racism card, give him a ticker tape when he comes home.? Ambassador Sondland further told the president that Sweden, ?Should have released him on your word, but that you can tell the Kardashians you tried.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	After the call ended, Ambassador Sondland remarked that the president was in a bad mood as Ambassador Sondland stated was often the case early in the morning. I then took the opportunity to ask Ambassador Sondland for his candid impression of the president?s views on Ukraine. In particular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that the president did not give a expletive about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland agreed that the president did not give an expletive about Ukraine.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I asked, ?Why not?? Ambassador Sondland stated that the president only cares about big stuff. I noted there was big stuff going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant big stuff that benefits the president like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. The conversation then moved on to other topics.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Upon returning to the embassy, I immediately briefed my direct supervisor, the deputy chief of mission about Ambassador Sondland?s call with President Trump and my subsequent conversation with Ambassador Sondland. I told others at the embassy about the call as well. I also emailed an embassy official in Sweden regarding the issue with the US rapper that was discussed on the call.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	July 26th was my last day in the office ahead of a long planned vacation that ended on August 6th. After returning to the embassy, I told Ambassador Taylor about the July 26th call. I also repeated repeatedly referred to the call and the conversation with Ambassador Sondland in meetings and conversations where the issue of the president?s interest in Ukraine was potentially relevant.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	At that time, Ambassador Sondland?s statement of the president?s lack of interest in Ukraine was of particular focus. We understood that in order to secure a meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky, we would have to work hard to find a way to explain Ukraine?s importance to President Trump in terms that he found compelling.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Over the ensuing weeks, we continued to try to identify ways to frame the importance of Ukraine in ways that would appeal to the president, to determine how to lift the hold on security assistance and to move forward on the scheduling of the White House by President Zelensky.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Ukrainian Independence Day, August 24th, presented another good opportunity to show support for Ukraine. Secretary Pompeo had considered attending as National Security Advisor Bolton had attended in 2018 and Defense Secretary Mattis had attended in 2017. But in the end, nobody senior to Ambassador Volker attended.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Shortly thereafter on August 27th, Ambassador Bolton visited Ukraine and brought welcome news that President Trump had agreed to meet President Zelensky on September 1st in Warsaw. Ambassador Bolton further indicated that the hold on security assistance would not be lifted prior to the Warsaw meeting where it would hang on whether President Zelensky was able to ?Favorably impress President Trump.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I took notes in Ambassador Bolton?s meetings that day with President Zelensky and his chief of staff. Ambassador Bolton told Zelensky?s chief of staff that the meeting between the president and Warsaw would be, ?Crucial to cementing their relationship.? However, President Trump ultimately pulled out of the Warsaw trip, so the hold remained in place with no clear means to get it lifted.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Between the meetings on August 27th, I heard Ambassador Bolton express to Ambassador Taylor and National Security Council Senior Director Tim Morrison his frustration about Mr. Giuliani?s influence with the president, making clear there was nothing he could do about it. He recommended that Mr. Lutsenko?s replacement as prosecutor general open a channel with his counterpart, Attorney General Barr, in place of the informal channel between Mr. Yermak and Mr. Giuliani. Ambassador Bolton also expressed frustration about Ambassador Sondland?s expansive interpretation of his mandate.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	After President Trump canceled his visit to Warsaw, we continued to try to appeal to the president in foreign policy and national security terms. To that end, Ambassador Taylor told me that Ambassador Bolton recommended that he, Ambassador Taylor, send a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo articulating the importance of the security assistance. At Ambassador Taylor?s direction, I drafted and transmitted the cable on Ambassador Taylor?s behalf on August 29th, which further attempted to explain the importance of Ukraine and the security assistance to US national security.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	By this point however, my clear impression was that the security assistance hold was likely intended by the president either as an expression of dissatisfaction with Ukrainians, who were not yet agreed to the Burisma-Biden investigation, or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so. On September 5th, I took notes at Senator Johnson and Senator Chris Murphy?s meetings with President Zelensky in Kyiv where president Zelensky asked about the security assistance. Although both senators stressed strong bipartisan congressional support for Ukraine, Senator Johnson cautioned President Zelensky that President Trump has a negative view of Ukraine and that President Zelensky would have a difficult time overcoming it.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Senator Johnson further explained that he had been, ?Shocked by President Trump?s negative reaction during an oval office meeting on May 23rd when he and the three amigos proposed that President Trump meet President Zelensky and show support for Ukraine.? On September 8th, Ambassador Taylor told me, ?Now they?re insisting Zelensky commit to the investigation in an interview with CNN,? which I took to refer to this three amigos. I was shocked the requirement was so specific and concrete.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	While we had advised our Ukranian counterparts to voice a commitment to following the rule of law in generally investigating credible corruption allegations, this was a demand that President Zelensky personally commit on a cable news channel to a specific investigation of President Trump?s political rival.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	On September 11th, the hold was finally lifted after significant press coverage and bipartisan congressional expressions of concern about the withholding of security assistance. Although we knew the hold was lifted, we were still concerned that President Zelensky had committed in exchange for the lifting, to give the requested CNN interview. We had several indications that the interview would occur.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	First, the YES conference in Kyiv was held from September 12th to 14th and CNN?s Fareed Zakaria was one of the moderators. Second on September 13th, an embassy colleague received a phone call from another colleague who worked for Ambassador Sondland. My colleague texted me regarding that call, that, ?Sondland said the Zelensky interview was supposed to be today or Monday. They plan to announce that a certain investigation that was on hold will progress.? Sondland?s aid did not know if this was decided or if Sondland was advocating for it. Apparently he?s been discussing this with Yermak.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Finally also on September 13th, Ambassador Taylor and I ran into Mr. Yermak on our way out to a meeting with President Zelensky in his private office. Ambassador Taylor again stressed the importance of staying out of US politics and said he hoped no interview was planned. Mr. Yermak did not answer, but shrugged in resignation as if to indicate that he had no choice.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	In short, everybody thought there was going to be an interview and that the Ukrainians believed they had to do it. The interview ultimately did not occur. On September 21st, Ambassador Taylor and I collaborated on input he sent to Mr. Morrison to brief President Trump ahead of a September 25th meeting that had been scheduled with President Zelensky in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly. The transcript of the July 25th call was released the same day. As of today, I have still not seen a readout of the September 25th meeting.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	As the impeachment inquiry has progressed, I?ve followed press reports and reviewed the statements of Ambassadors Taylor and Yovanovitch. Based on my experiences in Ukraine, my recollection is generally consistent with their testimony. I believe the relevant facts were therefore being laid out for the American people. However in the last couple of weeks, I read press reports expressing for the first time that certain senior officials may have been acting without the presence, knowledge or freelancing in their dealings with Ukraine. At the same time, I also read reports noting that the lack of first-hand evidence in the investigation and suggesting that the only evidence being elicited at the hearings was hearsay.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I came to realize that I had first-hand knowledge regarding certain events on July 26 that had not otherwise been reported and that those events potentially bore on the question of whether the president did in fact have knowledge that those senior officials were using the levers of diplomatic power to influence the new Ukrainian president to announce the opening of a criminal investigation against President Trump?s political opponent. It is at that point that I made the observation to Ambassador Taylor that the incident I had witnessed on July 26th had acquired greater significance, which is what he reported in his testimony last week and is what led to the subpoena for me to appear here today.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	In conclusion, I?d like to take a moment to turn back to Ukraine. Today, this very day marks exactly six years since throngs of pro-Western Ukrainians spontaneously gathered on Kyiv?s Independence Square to launch what became known as the Revolution of Dignity. While the protest began in opposition to a turn towards Russia and away from the West, they expanded over three months to reject the entire corrupt repressive system that had been sustained by Russian influence in the country. Those events were followed by Russia?s occupation of Ukraine?s Crimean Peninsula and invasion of Ukraine?s Eastern Donbass region, and an ensuing war that to date has cost almost 14,000 lives.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Despite the Russian aggression over the past five years, Ukrainians have rebuilt a shattered economy, adhered to a peace process and moved economically and socially closer to the West, toward our way of life. Earlier this year, large majorities of Ukrainians again chose a fresh start by voting for a political newcomer as president, replacing 80% of their parliament and endorsing a platform consistent with our democratic values, our foreign priorities and our strategic interests.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	This year?s revolution at the ballot box underscores that despite its imperfections, Ukraine is a genuine and vibrant democracy and an example to other post-Soviet countries and beyond from Moscow to Hong Kong. How we respond to this historic opportunity will set the trajectory of our relationship with Ukraine and will define our willingness to defend our bedrock international principles and our leadership role in the world.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Ukrainians wants to hear a clear and unambiguous reaffirmation that our long-standing bipartisan policy of strong support for Ukraine remains unchanged and that we fully back it at the highest levels. Now is not the time to retreat from our relationship with Ukraine, but rather to double down on it. As we sit here today, Ukrainians are fighting a hot war on Ukrainian territory against Russian aggression. This week alone since I have been here in Washington, two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and two injured by Russian-led forces in Eastern Ukraine despite a declared ceasefire. I learned overnight that seven more were injured yesterday.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	As Vice President Pence said after his meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw, the US-Ukraine relationship has never been stronger. Ukrainians and their new government earnestly want to believe that. Ukrainians cherish their bipartisan American support that has sustained their Euro-Atlantic aspirations. They recoil at the thought of playing a role in US domestic politics or elections.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	At a time of shifting allegiances and rising competitors in the world, we have no better friends than Ukraine, a scrappy, unbowed, determined and above all dignified people who are standing up against Russian authoritarianism and aggression. They deserve better. We?re now at an inflection point in Ukraine and it is critical to our national security that we stand in strong support of our Ukrainian partners. Ukrainians and freedom loving people everywhere are watching the example we set here of democracy and the rule of law. Thank you.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes sir. So our long standing policy is to encourage them to establish and build a rule of law institutions that are capable, and they?re independent, and that can actually pursue credible allegations. That?s our policy and we?ve been doing that for quite some time with some success. So focusing on particular cases, including particular cases where there is an interest of the President?s, is just not part of what we?ve done. It?s hard to explain why we would do that.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir. And although the hold on the security assistance may have been lifted, there were still things they wanted that they weren?t getting, including a meeting with the President in the Oval Office. Whether the hold, the security assistance hold continued or not, the Ukrainians understood that that?s something the President wanted and they still wanted important things from the President. So, and I think that continues to this day. I think they?re being very careful. They still need us now going forward.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	"In fact, right now President Zelensky is trying to arrange a summit meeting with President Putin in the coming weeks; his first face-to-face meeting with him to try to advance the peace process. He needs our support. He needs President Putin to understand that America supports Zelensky at the highest levels. So this is, this doesn?t end with the lifting of the security assistance hold. Ukraine still needs us, and as I said, still fighting this war this very day."
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	We understood that he had been told to work with Mr. Giuliani.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I couldn?t be sure what he was referring to until I later read the transcript of the July 25th call, but I was aware of various contacts between the Three Amigos and his government about this set of issues.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The Burisma-Biden investigation.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He did not.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	"Yes, sir. The restaurant has sort of glass doors that open onto a terrace, and we were at the first tables on the terrace; so immediately outside of the interior of the restaurant. The doors were all wide open. There were, there was tables, a table for four, although I recall it being two tables for two pushed together. In any case, it was quite a wide table, and the table was set with sort of a table runner down in the middle. I was directly across from Ambassador Sondland. We were close enough that we could, you know, share an appetizer between us. And then the two staffers were off to our right at this next table."
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	It was, there?s several things. It was quite loud when the President came on, quite distinctive. I believe Ambassador Sondland also said yesterday he often speaks very loudly over the phone, and I certainly experienced that. When the President came on, he sort of winced and held the phone away from his ear like this, and he did that for the first couple exchanges. I don?t know if he then turned the volume down, if he got used to it, if the President moderated his volume. I don?t know, but that?s how I was able to hear it.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The first portion of the conversation, yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	What did I hear the-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yeah, he clarified whether he was in Ukraine or not, and he said yes, I?m here in Ukraine. And then Ambassador Sondland said, said ?He loves your ass. He?ll do anything you want.? He said, ?Is he going to do the investigation?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	? He said, ?Is he going to do the investigation?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He said, ?Oh, yeah. He?s going to do it. He?ll do anything you ask.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He said he doesn?t really care about Ukraine.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He did.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He said he cares about big stuff.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I asked him, ?What kind of big stuff? We have big stuff going on here, like a war with Russia,? and he said, ?No, big stuff like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani is pushing.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yeah. So this was a very distinctive experience. I?ve never seen anything like this in my foreign service career. Someone at a lunch in a restaurant making a call on a cell phone to the President of the United States. Being able to hear his voice, his very distinctive personality, as we?ve all seen on television. Very colorful language was used. They were directly addressing something that I had been wondering about working on for weeks and even months. A topic that had led to the recall of my former boss, the former Ambassador. And so here was a person who said he had direct contact with the President, and had said that over the course of time. Here he is actually having that contact with the President, hearing the President?s voice, and them talking about this issue of the Biden investigation that I had been hearing about.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir. In that brief meeting with the Chief of Staff, it was very confusing to me why, in only the few minutes we had, that would?ve been the issue he raised. So it wasn?t until I read the transcript of the call on the 25th that I understood that the President had specifically mentioned Prosecutor General Lutsenko, who the Zelensky administration was in the process of replacing and carving out all his underlings who had been collaborating with him on some of the corruption we saw there.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir. About two weeks before the press wave that we saw targeting Ambassador Yovanovitch became public, an embassy contact had reported to us privately that Mr. Lutsenko was sending these messages, and had met with an American journalist to try to get those messages out.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He was not a good partner. He had failed to deliver on the promised reforms that he had committed to when he took office, and he was using his office to insulate and protect political allies while presumably enriching himself.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	First of all, to deflect from the allegations of Russian interference. Second of all, to drive a wedge between the United States and Ukraine, which Russia wants to essentially get back into its sphere of influence. Thirdly, to besmirch Ukraine and its political leadership, to degrade and erode support for Ukraine from other key partners in Europe and elsewhere.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir, and we understood that that was the plan.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I believe they did. First, he was reaching out to them directly. Ambassador Yovanovitch?s removal, I think, is relevant to this portion of the inquiry because she was removed following this media campaign in which Rudy Giuliani and his associates were very prominent, and criticizing her for not taking seriously some of the theories and issues that later came up. And so when she was removed, commentators in Ukraine believed that Lutsenko, working with Giuliani, had succeeded in getting her removed.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	So they were already aware of Mr. Giuliani and his influence, the issues that he was promoting, and, ultimately, that he was able to get an Ambassador removed partly because of that. So he was-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	? ambassador removed, partly because of that, so he was someone to contend with. Then in addition, immediately after the inauguration, he began reaching out to this Zelensky administration, key figures in the Zelensky administration, and continue to do that.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I joined them in in some of their meetings, but not for the entire day.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir. It was five people. It was: The head of the delegation was Secretary Perry, and then it was Ambassador Volker representing the State Department, Ambassador Sondland, our temporary [sharjay 00:32:43], Joseph Pennington and Alex Vindman representing the White House.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes. In the meeting with the president, Secretary Perry as the head of the delegation opened the meeting for the American side and had a number of points he made, and during that period he handed over a piece of paper. I did not see what was on the paper, but Secretary Perry described what was on the paper as a list of trusted individuals and recommended that President Zelensky could draw from that list for advice on energy sector reform issues.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I didn?t see the list. I don?t know. There are other other people who have been in the mix for awhile on that set of issues, other people Secretary Perry has mentioned as being people to consult on reform.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir. He was the last to speak. He made a general point about the importance of Ukraine, joint national security, and he said it?s very important that the Zelensky administration stay out of us domestic politics.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	My understanding is the prosecutor general at the time, Shokin, was not at that time pursuing investigations of Burisma or the Bidens.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	That?s correct, and not just us, but all of our allies and other institutions that were involved in Ukraine at the time.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	We?d been hearing about the investigation since March, months before. President Zelensky had received a letter, a congratulatory letter, from the president saying he?d be pleased to meet him following his inauguration in May. We hadn?t been able to get that meeting, and then the security hold came up with no explanation. I?d be surprised if any of the Ukrainians ? you said earlier, we discussed earlier, sophisticated people ? when they received no explanation for why that hold was in place, they wouldn?t have drawn that conclusion.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Exactly.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	They?re an important strategic deterrent. They?re not actively employed in combat operations right now, but the mere idea that were the Russians to advance substantially using certain kinds of armor that the Ukrainians would have this capability deters them from doing so. And it also thereby sends a very important symbolic message to the Ukrainian military that they have access to these high end technology and that we trust them to do it. I would only add also they?ve offered to buy some using their own funds. The initial traunch was provided through basically a program to do that, but they?ve now offered to spend their own money to buy more, so I think they think they?re important.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I have.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Journalist again.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I?m not aware of Nellie Ohr, I?m not aware of who he provided information to. I?m aware that as a journalist he?s provided information.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I have.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I?m not aware of that Bob Mueller did not find it credible. I think it was evidence in other criminal proceedings. Its credibility was not questioned in those proceedings, but I?m not an expert on that matter.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	If you mean by the release of the ? black ledger?, I think Leshchenko?s motivation was the same motivation he?s always expressed, which is to expose corruption in Ukraine.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He has not said that to me. If he said that to you, I?ll take your word for it.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	So sir, I never had any involvement directly with-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	So I do want to be clear that all that happened before I arrived in Ukraine. So I don?t have any firsthand-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Understood, but I do want to be clear about that. And then in addition, I have read about those issues, but I?m not an expert on them.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I wouldn?t be in a position to dispute that, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I think it was fine in that regard.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I do.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I would defer to George Kent, who was involved at the time and is an expert on those issues.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I?ve heard that.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	So sir, after the hold was placed on the security assistance, many people I think, were scrambling to try to understand why. I believe it was Senator Johnson who had said that the president was concerned about burden sharing, perhaps others as well. And so trying to interpret why this might?ve happened and we were looking into the facts of what the Europeans have provided and what we have provided. It was very illuminating what we learned. The United States has provided combined civilian and military assistance to Ukraine since 2014 of about $3 billion plus three $1 billion loan guarantees that?s not? Those get paid back largely. So just over $3 billion. The Europeans at the level of the European Union plus the member States combined since 2014, my understanding have provided a combined $12 billion to Ukraine.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I believe so, yeah. This was done in collaboration with other missions, the EU to NATO and others. Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	We don?t know. If the concern was that others weren?t spending as much as we were to support Ukraine, then that information showed a different story.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes in mid September. [inaudible 00:12:05].
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Was that sir?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	May I answer that question?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Thank you.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes sir. So immediately when I went back to the embassy after this lunch on the 26th, I told my direct supervisor, the Deputy Chief of Mission. I would have told Ambassador Taylor immediately, except he was on the front lines that afternoon. I then went on, as I?ve testified, my vacation on Saturday, came back the following Monday and on Tuesday I was back in the ambassador?s office where I referred to the call. In that week plus that I was away, it was my assumption that the Deputy Chief of Mission would?ve informed other people about the call as well.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	So my recollection is when I did refer to the call in that meeting, that ambassador Taylor nodded knowingly as though he had been briefed on it. So I referred to the call and I mentioned some of my takeaways from the call. And at the time the main takeaway from the call was, the president doesn?t care about Ukraine. So we?re going to have a tough road ahead to convince him that it?s important enough for him to schedule an Oval Office meeting for president?s Zelensky and ultimately to release this hold on security assistance. That was the takeaway. And that?s what I referred to repeatedly in the coming weeks whenever it came relevant. And I?ll remind you sir that, one more important point, throughout this time, as I testified, we were trying to find a formula, things we could do with Ukrainians that would convince the president that they were worth talking to.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No, actually sir-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Sir, I believe that when I-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Sir, if I could answer, I see four seconds left on the clock. I believe-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Thank you sir. I believe that Ambassador Taylor did already know when I briefed him, when I returned from vacation on the sixth, it was not news to him that the president was pressing for a Biden investigation.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Okay thank you. It?s exactly my point. I briefed the call in detail to the Deputy Chief of Mission, went away for a week, come back, I refer to the call and everyone is nodding. Of course, that?s what?s going on. Of course the president is pressing for a Biden investigation before he?ll do these things the Ukrainians want. There was nodding agreement. So it did I go through every single word in the call? No, because everyone by that point agreed. It was obvious what the president was pressing for and Ambassador Taylor, as you?ve just outlined, had all those other interactions-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	But sir, my vivid recollection of an event I was involved with was a touchstone experience that to me, validated-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	What we believed. And Ambassador Taylor was not in that call.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I?ll finish with this.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He was involved in a number of other interactions as you?ve outlined, that brought him to the same conclusion. It is quite possible-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I have sir. Thank you.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He said, ?Good. What about Sweden?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Sir, he ? I?m sorry. I need to look at back where we are in the middle of the conversation here. Where are we from the testimony? Exactly. Then, they turn to the Sweden conversation.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He said, ?Good. What about Sweden?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Sir, it?s not a word for word, every single word in the conversation.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Well, then they turn to Sweden. They turn to the other topic.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir. The Ukraine portion of that conversation was extremely brief.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	They ?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir. Sondland greeted the President.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He said, ?Hello, Mr. President. I?m in Kiev,? and the president said, ?Are you in Ukraine?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	He said, ?Are you in Ukraine?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I did not hear President Trump?s side of the conversation about ASAP Rocky.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir. As I?ve testified, the initial part of the call, Ambassador Sondland sort of ? When the president came on the call, he sort of winced and held the phone away from his ear for the initial portion of the call. And then at some point in the call, he stopped doing that. I don?t know why. I don?t know if he turned the volume down. I don?t know if the president spoke more quietly. I don?t know if he got used to the volume. I don?t know what changed.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I don?t know, sir. Ambassador Sondland stopped moving the phone away from his ear. That?s what ?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I only heard of Ambassador Sondland?s side of the conversation, sir. And at the end of the conversation, he was giving the president advice on how to deal with this ASAP Rocky situation. And he said, ?You know, they should have released him on your word, and you can tell the Kardashians you tried.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I?m sorry, sir?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	When did Gordon Sondland ask Zelensky about the investigations?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	You?re asking in which meeting did he raise the investigations?
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	My assumption is he did it in the closed-door meeting with Yermak.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, ma?am. She was extremely professional, respected in Ukraine by Ukrainians. I think also by visiting American senior officials, including members of this committee and of Congress who came to visit. She was extremely dedicated, hardworking.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I did, yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	It was a very confusing time. As I?ve said before, a president has the right to remove an ambassador for any or no reason at all. It was not clear to us why this was happening or why people weren?t standing up for her.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Absolutely it does.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	It does.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Well, it doesn?t help Ukraine.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Again, doesn?t help Ukraine.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Just to add that Danylyuk speaks perfect English and Yermak can get by in meetings but often does ask for clarifications.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	That?s correct. And I would just say I think we discussed the importance of all our security assistance to Ukraine, not just the Javelin.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Ultimately.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	They did not open a new investigation to the Bidens.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	The president invited Zelensky to the Oval Office at a date undetermined that has not yet happened.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	They did, but not in the Oval Office.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	They did, ma?am.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	That?s right.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	President Zelensky.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Absolutely, sir. President Zelensky was elected on an overwhelming majority to defend Ukrainian interests. This is at a time when Ukrainians are defending their sovereignty, their territorial integrity, on Ukrainian soil from Russian-backed soldiers who are attacking them. As I said, 14,000 Ukrainian lives lost in this war so far, as I mentioned a few this week already, and this is a hot war. This is not a frozen conflict. People are shooting at each other and dying, being injured every single week. Despite the ongoing war, they?re still trying to pursue peace. President Zelensky even right now is trying to pursue a summit meeting with President Putin in order to try to bring this war to a conclusion so they can move on with all of the difficult things that they need to do in terms of building the economy and reforming the judiciary and what not.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	And I want to add just one other thing, sir, if I may. Mr. Turner had suggested earlier that I?d somehow embarrassed President Zelensky. I have the deepest respect for President Zelensky. This is a guy of Jewish background from an post-Soviet industrial suburb in Southern Ukraine who made himself one of the most popular entertainers in the country and somehow got elected president, and he?s not going to miss that opportunity. This is a Ukrainian patriot. This is a tough guy, and frankly he withstood a lot of pressure for a very long time, and he didn?t give that interview. I have a deepest respect for him. The Ukrainian people also have the deepest respect for him. They?ve chosen him to help deliver the full measure of promise of their revolution of dignity, and I think he merits all of our respect.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Sir, I didn?t see the names on the list myself.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I have since heard that Michael Bleyzer?s on the list.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Very rare. Almost never.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Very bad precedent and going forward, if that were ever the case, I would raise objections.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Of course. Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Sir, I think it was Gordon Sondland who showed indiscretion by having that conversation over an open phone line [crosstalk 02:17:02]-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	? that?s the first thing.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Second thing is, I didn?t-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Sir, I shared the information that I needed to share with the right people who needed to know it. I did not share any information that people didn?t need to know.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	It certainly was interesting. Sir, and I would also hate to think that what I brought before this process, I shouldn?t have done that. I?ve come here because you subpoenaed me to share what I know and I?ve done that.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I think-
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	That?s right, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No, they weren?t.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	No, sir.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Absolutely, sir. It?s been said that without Ukraine, Russia?s just a country, but with it, it?s an empire.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Yes.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Absolutely. Absolutely.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	That?s correct.
2019-11-21	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	It calls into question the extent to which they can count on us.
2019-12-09	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	I heard Ambassador Sondland greet the president and explain he was calling from [inaudible 00:02:31]. I heard President Trump then clarify that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland replied, “Yes, he was in Ukraine,” and went on to state that President Zelensky, “Loves your ass.” I then heard President Trump ask, “So he’s going to do the investigation?” Ambassador Sondland and replied that he’s going to do it, adding that President Zelensky will do anything you ask him to do.
2019-12-09	David Holmes	W-Holmes	W-Holmes	Ambassador Sondland stated that the President only cares about big stuff. I noted there was big stuff going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. And Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant big stuff that benefits the President, like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Good morning. My name is George Kent, and I am the deputy assistant secretary of state for Eastern Europe and the Caucuses. I have served proudly as a nonpartisan career foreign service officer for more than 27 years under five presidents, three Republican and two Democrat. As I mentioned in my opening comments last month in the closed-door deposition, I represent the third generation of my family to have chosen a career in public service and sworn the oath of office that all US public servants do in defense of our Constitution. Indeed, there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the constitution continuously for nearly 60 years, ever since my father reported to Annapolis for his plebe summer. After graduating first in his Naval Academy class in 1965, the year best known for his Heisman-winning classmate, Roger Staubach, my father served a full, honorable 30 years, including as a captain of a nuclear ballistic missile submarine during the height of the Cold War.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Five great-uncles served honorably in the Navy and the Army in World War II. In particular, Tom Taggart was stationed in the Philippines at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He survived the brutal Bataan Death March and three and a half years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp unbroken. He returned to service as an Air Force judge advocate, upholding the rule of law until his death in 1965. Today, I appear before you once again under subpoena as a fact witness ready to answer all of your questions about the events and developments examined in this inquiry to the best of my ability and recollection, subject to the limits placed on me by the law and this process. I will begin with some opening comments on the key principles at the heart of what brings me before you today, to wit, principled public service in pursuit of our enduring national interests and the place of Ukraine international and security interests.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	For the past five years we have focused our united efforts across the Atlantic to support Ukraine in its fight for the cause of freedom and the rebirth of a country free from Russian dominion and the warped legacy of Soviet institutions and post-Soviet behavior. As I stated in my closed-door deposition last month, you don’t step into the public arena of international diplomacy in active pursuit of principled US interests without expecting vigorous pushback, including personal attacks. Such attacks came from the Russians, their proxies, and corrupt Ukrainians. That tells me our efforts were hitting their mark. It was unexpected and most unfortunate, however, to watch some Americans, including those who allied themselves with corrupt Ukrainians in pursuit of private agendas, launch attacks on dedicated public servants, advancing US interests in Ukraine. In my opinion, those attacks undermined US and Ukrainian national interests and damaged our critical bilateral relationship.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	The United States has very clear national interests at stake in Ukraine. Ukraine’s success is very much in our national interest in the way we have defined our national interest broadly in Europe for the past 75 years. After World War II, US leadership furthered far-sighted policies like the Marshall Plan in the creation of a rules-based international order protected by the collective security provided by NATO. Western Europe recovered and thrived after the carnage of World War II, not withstanding the shadow of the Iron Curtain. Europe’s security and prosperity contributed to our security and prosperity. Support of Ukraine’s success also fits squarely into our strategy for Central and Eastern Europe since the fall of the wall 30 years ago this past week. A Europe truly whole, free, and at peace, our strategic game for the entirety of my foreign service career, is not possible without a Ukraine whole, free, and at peace, including Crimea and the Donbass, territories currently occupied by Russia, represented by the red in the map.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Looking forward, the Trump administration’s national security strategy makes clear the global strategic challenge now before us: great power competition with rivals such as Russia and China, and the need to compete for positive influence without taking countries for granted. In that sense, Ukraine has been on the front lines, not just of Russia’s conventional war in Eastern Europe since 2014 and its broader campaign of malign influence, but of the greater geopolitical challenges now facing the United States. Ukraine’s popular revolution of dignity in 2014 forced a corrupt, pro-Russian leadership to flee to Moscow. After that, Russia invaded Ukraine, occupying 7% of its territory, roughly equivalent to the size of Texas for the United States. At that time, Ukraine’s state institutions were on the verge of collapse. Ukrainian civil society answered the challenge. They formed volunteer battalions of citizens, including technology professionals and medics. They crowdsourced funding for their own weapons, body armor, and supplies.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	They were the 21st century Ukrainian equivalent of our own Minutemen of 1776, buying time for a regular army to reconstitute. Since then, more than 13,000 Ukrainians have died on Ukrainian soil, defending their territorial integrity and sovereignty from Russian aggression. America’s support in Ukraine’s own de facto war of independence has been critical in this regard. By analogy, the American colonies may not have prevailed against the British imperial might without the help of transatlantic friends after 1776. In an echo of Lafayette’s organized assistance to General George Washington’s army and Admiral John Paul Jones’ navy, Congress has generously appropriated over $1.5 billion over the past five years, and desperately-needed trained and equipped security assistance to Ukraine. These funds increase Ukraine’s strength and ability to fight Russian aggression. Ultimately, Ukraine is on a path to become a full security partner of the United States within NATO. Similar to von Steuben training colonials at Valley Forge, US and NATO allied trainers develop the skills of Ukrainian units at Yavoriv, near the Polish border and elsewhere.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	They help rewrite military education for Ukraine’s next generation, as von Steuben did for America’s first. In supporting Ukraine’s brave resistance to Russian aggression we have a front row seat to the Russian way of war in the 21st century, gaining priceless insights that contribute to our own security. This year, in 2019, Ukrainian citizens passed the political torch to a new generation, one that came of age not in the final years of the Soviet Union, but in an independent Ukraine. Presidential and parliamentary elections swept out much of Ukraine’s previous governing elite and seated 41-year-old President Zelensky, a cabinet with an average age of 39, and a parliament with the average age of 41.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	At the heart of that change mandate, five years after Ukraine’s revolution of dignity, is a thirst for justice, because there cannot be dignity without justice. Without a reformed judicial sector that delivers justice with integrity for all, Ukrainian society will remain unsettled. Foreign investors, including American investors, will not bring the great investment needed to ensure that Ukraine’s long-term prosperity is secured. This is why the principled promotion of the rule of law and institutional integrity is so necessary to our strategy for a successful Ukraine. It is also true for other former captive nations still recovering from the ashes of Soviet and communist misrule. It is why acting inconsistently with the core principle of the rule of law comes at great peril. I am grateful to all of the members of Congress and staffers, including many of you sitting here today, who have traveled to Ukraine over the past five years and appropriated billions of dollars of assistance and support of our primary policy goals.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Those funds increase Ukraine’s ability to fight Russian aggression in the defense, energy, cyber, and information spheres. They also empower state institutions and civil society to undertake systemic reforms and tackle corruption. I believe all of us can be proud of our efforts in Ukraine over the past five years, even though much remains to be done. By all of us, I mean those of us in the legislative and the executive branches in both parties, the interagency community working out of our embassy in Kiev, with Ukrainians in government, the military, and civil society, and our transatlantic allies and partners. We cannot allow our resolve to waver, since too much is at stake, not just for Ukraine and the future of European security, but for the national interests of the United States broadly defined. My prior deposition covered a lot of ground over 10 hours. Here are the main 10 themes from my testimony.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	"I outlined my experience with longstanding US interest in supporting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. This work gave me a front row seat to problematic activities by successive prosecutors general in Ukraine. For many of the issues this committee is investigating, my knowledge and understanding is sometimes firsthand and sometimes comes from others involved in specific conversations and meetings. This is no different than how anyone learns and carries out his or her job responsibilities. I have been and remain willing to share my factual observations with the committee and will make clear when those are based on personal knowledge or from information gleaned from others. US efforts to counter corruption in Ukraine focus on building institutional capacity so that the Ukrainian government has the ability to go after corruption and effectively investigate, prosecute, and judge alleged criminal activities using appropriate institutional mechanisms; that is, to create and follow the rule of law."
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That means that if there are criminal nexuses for activity in the United States, US law enforcement should pursue the case. If we think there’s been a criminal act overseas that violates US law, we have the institutional mechanisms to address that. It could be through the justice department and FBI agents assigned overseas, or through treaty mechanisms such as the mutual legal assistance treaty. As a general principle, I do not believe the United States should ask other countries to engage in selective, politically-associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power, because such selective actions undermine the rule of law, regardless of the country. The pervasive and longstanding problem of corruption in Ukraine included exposure to a situation involving the energy company Burisma. The primary concern of the US government since 2014 was Burisma’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, whose frozen assets abroad we had attempted to recover on Ukraine’s behalf. In early 2015 I raised questions with the deputy prosecutor general about why the investigation of Mr. Zlochevsky had been terminated, based on our belief that prosecutors had accepted bribes to close the case.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Later, I became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma. Soon after that, in a briefing call with the national security staff of the office of the vice president in February of 2015, I raised my concern that Hunter Biden’s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest. Let me be clear, however: I did not witness any effort by any US official to shield Burisma from scrutiny. In fact, I and other US officials consistently advocated re-instituting a scuttled investigation of Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, as well as holding the corrupt prosecutors who closed the case to account. Over the course of 2018 and 2019 I became increasingly aware of an effort by Rudy Giuliani and others, including his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to run a campaign to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch and other officials at the US embassy in Kiev.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	The chief agitators on the Ukrainian side of this effort were some of those same corrupt former prosecutors I had encountered, particularly [inaudible 00:12:50] and Viktor Shoken. They were now peddling false information in order to extract revenge against those who had exposed their misconduct, including US diplomats, Ukrainian anti-corruption officials, and reform-minded civil society groups in Ukraine. During the late spring and summer of 2019 I became alarmed as those efforts bore fruit. They led to the ouster of Ambassador Yovanovitch and hampered US efforts to establish rapport with the new Zelensky administration in Ukraine. In mid-August it became clear to me that Giuliani’s efforts to gin up politically-motivated investigations were now infecting US engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President Zelensky’s desire for a White House meeting. There are and always have been conditionality placed on our sovereign loan guarantees for Ukraine. Conditions include anti-corruption reforms, as well as meeting larger stability goals and social safety nets.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	"The International Monetary Fund does the same thing. Congress and the executive branch work together to put conditionality on some security assistance in the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. Regarding my testimony today I will do my best to answer your questions; questions that will involve issues, conversations, and documents that span a number of years. I may be limited by three considerations. First, the state department has collected all materials in response to the September 27th subpoena that may contain facts relevant to my testimony. I have no such documents or materials with me today. I will thus do my best to answer as accurately, completely, and truthfully as I can to the best of my recollection. Second, as this committee knows from deposition testimony, throughout this process there have been concerns that questions may be asked about classified information."
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	We have asked the State Department for guidance about classification concerns related to the public release of my deposition, and the State Department has declined to provide any. So, if I’m asked a question today that I believe may implicate classified information, I will respectfully decline to answer in this public forum. Third, there may be questions focusing on the identity of people in the intelligence community. These questions were redacted from my deposition’s transcript. If such a question arises today, I will follow my council’s advice and decline to answer. I would like to conclude my opening remarks with an observation about some of my fellow public servants who have come under personal attacks: Ambassador Yovanovicth, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, and Dr. Hill, at least one of whom is going to appear before this body in the coming days. Masha, Alex, and Fiona were born abroad before their families or they, themselves, personally chose to immigrate to the United States. They all made the professional choice to serve the United States as public officials, helping shape our national security policy towards Russia in particular, and we and our national security are the better for it.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	In this sense, they are the 21st century heirs of two giants of 20th century US national security policy, who also were born abroad: my former professors Zbigniew Brzezinski and his fellow immigrant Henry Kissinger. Like the Brzezinskis and Kissingers, the Yovanovitches and Vindmans fled Nazi and communist oppression to contribute to a stronger, more secure America. That honorable tradition of transatlantic ties goes back to the very founding of our republic. Our 18th century independence would not have been secured without the choice of European officers: the French-born Lafayette and Rochambeau, the German-born von Steuben, and the Poles Pulaski and Kosciuszko to come to the New World and fight for our cause of freedom and the birth of a new country free from imperial dominion. It is my privilege to sit next to my former boss, Ambassador Taylor, today, and it is my honor to serve with all of these patriotic Americans. Thank you.  Adam Schiff Questioning Bill Taylor
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To the best of my knowledge, he was minister of energy, sorry, minister of ecology under President Yanukovych, from 2010 to 2012. And at the time, licenses to have substrata exploration of gas were awarded by subdivision of the ministry of ecology.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Correct. His time as minister was 2010 to 2012. Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have and I have it in front of me, but I haven’t read it for about a month.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To the best of my knowledge, no.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To the best of my knowledge, no.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I see that here, yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I believe so, yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I’m referring as a general principle about the promotion of the rule of law.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It could be interpreted that way, yes sir.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I was not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Sir, we work for the Department of State in an Embassy overseas, and in preparation for a presidential phone call, that responsibility lies within the staff of the National Security Council. Normally, if there is enough sufficient time, national security staff can solicit information, usually from the state department, and we can draw on the embassy. But that’s only background information. And my understanding, having never worked at the National Security Council, is that national security staff write a memo to the president. And none of us see that outside of the national security staff.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I was given notification the day before, on July 24th, and to the extent I had any role, it was to reach out to the embassy, give them a heads up, and ask them to ensure that the secure communications link, and the office of the president of Ukraine was functional, so the call could be patched through from the White House Situation Room.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I was not asked and I did not provide.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I would not say that was a consensus. The State Department’s position was that a call between the two presidents would be useful, and once Zelensky’s party won the first ever absolute majority in parliamentary elections on July 21st, the idea of a congratulatory call made eminent sense from our perspective.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I, likewise, first saw the Ukrainian statement and I believe the next day, July 26th, which would have been a Friday, I did get a partial readout from Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I would say up until the new set of prosecutors appointed by President Zelensky in the last two months, correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I would say we are cautiously optimistic and we will work wherever there is the political will to do the right thing, and put forward genuine reform.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is one element, yes sir.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Mr. Zlochevsky was Minister of Energy from 2010 to 2012 under the pro-Russian government, and he used his regulatory authority to award gas exploration licenses to companies that he, himself, controlled. That would be considered an act of corruption in my view, yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Certainly self-dealing and self-enriching.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	In the spring of 2014, the Ukrainian government, the new government after the Revolution of Dignity, turned to partners, particularly the U.S. and the U.K., to try to recover tens of billions of dollars of stolen assets. The first case that we tried to recover that money came from Mr. Zlochevsky. The Serious Crimes Office in the U.K. had already opened up an investigation. They worked with us and the Ukrainian authorities to develop more information. The $23 million was frozen until somebody in the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine shut the case, issued a letter to his lawyer, and that money went poof.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is our strong assumption, yes sir.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Mr. Zlochevsky spent time as far as I understand in Moscow and Monaco after he fled Ukraine. We continued to raise as a point of order that because U.S. taxpayer dollars had been used to try to recover frozen assets that we have a fiduciary responsibility, and we continued to press Ukrainian officials to answer for why alleged corrupt prosecutors had closed a case, and have until now not gotten an satisfactory answer.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	"So to summarize, we thought that Mykola Zlochevsky had stolen money; we thought a prosecutor had taken a bribe to shut the case, and those were our main concerns."
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I think since U.S. taxpayer dollars were wasted, I would love to see the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe and who much he was paid. And that’s what I said to the Deputy Prosecutor General on February 3rd, 2015.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I would agree that the Ukrainian law authorities should uphold the rule of law and hold people to account for breaking Ukrainian law.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I do not know that.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I would say that it’s the largest private gas producer in the country, and its business reputation is mixed.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I believe that the new Prosecutor General, [name 00:18:46], made a statement to that end, that they would be reviewing past cases. But keep in mind, this is a country where those that commit crimes generally never get held to account, so there’s a lot to review.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To the best of my knowledge, the case against Zlochevsky, the former Minister, was shut down December of 2014.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	My understanding is yes, that Mykola Zlochevsky invited a series of new individuals to join the board in 2014.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have never met Mr. Zlochevsky.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	The most prominent person he added to the board was the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwasniewski.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	There were a number of others, including some Americans, and the most prominent one in this context is Hunter Biden.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Sir, I work for the government. I don’t work in the corporate sector, and so I believe that companies build their boards with a variety of reasons, not only to promote their business plans.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have no idea what Hunter Biden studied at university or what his CV says.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have no awareness or knowledge of what his background was and what he may have done on the board of Burisma.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I’ve heard nothing about prior experience, no.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I do not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I do not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Again, no knowledge.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	He was.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I believe while he was Vice-President, he made a total of six visits to Ukraine. One may have been during the old regime, Yanokovich, and that would make five visits after the Revolution of Dignity, which started February of 2014.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Starting in 2015, yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	He did not. I came back for Ukrainian language training, and so I missed several visits.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have. I think it was a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in January, 2018.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To the best of my knowledge, when he was Vice-President he made six visits.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	No. The Vice-President’s role was critically important. It was top cover to help us pursue our policy agenda.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have no idea. I reported my concern to the office of the Vice-President.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Sir, you would have to ask people who worked in the office of the Vice-President during 2015.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Correct, because the Vice-President was promoting U.S. policy objectives in Ukraine.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To the best of my knowledge, it didn’t. And my concern was that there was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It’s not at outlandish as it could be. I agree with that.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	With very good knowledge of the region, yes sir.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I’m sure that’s right.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	"His first priority is clearly the United States, and to the extent that Ukraine has an implication for that, yes; Ukraine as well."
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It’s a little unusual for the U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. to play a role in Ukraine policy.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct, Mr. Castor.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	So I became aware in the summer, I believe, of 2016 that as a part of what I recall was a clean energy awareness campaign, the part of the USAID mission that worked on economics and governance, including energy, had sponsored some sort of contest for young Ukrainians to come up with a theme and there was a prize. I believe it may have been a camera. And they had co-sponsored with public private partnership being a buzzword, having a co-sponsorship with Burisma.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Given the past history of our interest in recovering stolen assets from Zlochevsky, it was my view that it was inappropriate for the embassy to be co-sponsoring a contest with Burisma. I raised that with the mission director at the embassy. She agreed, and the USAID mission kept the contest, but dropped the public private partnership sponsorship.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Yes, ma’am. I wrote a memo to the file on August 16th.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I submitted it to the State Department, subject to the September 27th subpoena.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Well, I think it sends the wrong signal and it did for a short period of time. Again, the assistance from the FYI 19 was released and is in the process of heading towards Ukraine.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I think the signal that there is controversy and question about the US support of Ukraine sends the signal to Vladimir Putin that he can leverage that as he seeks to negotiate with not only Ukraine, but other countries.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have specialized in anti-corruption and rule of law issues since 2012, correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	If we’re doing a systemic holistic program, you need institutions with integrity. That starts with investigators, it goes to prosecutors, it goes to courts and eventually it goes to the corrections system. In countries like Ukraine, we generally start with law enforcement and that’s what we did in 2014, 15 with the new patrol police. There also as oftentimes needed a specialized anti-corruption agency in Ukraine that was called the National Anti-corruption Bureau or NABU.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	There was a different body that reviewed asset declarations for unusual wealth called National Anti-corruption Prevention Council. And eventually we got to helping them establish a special anti-corruption prosecutor and eventually a high court on anti-corruption. And that was to try to create investigators, prosecutors and courts with integrity that couldn’t be bought and would be focused on high level corruption.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I do not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I do not think they are the same things. What former Vice President Biden requested of former President of Ukraine, Poroshenko, was the removal of a corrupt Prosecutor General, Victor Shokin, who had undermined a program of assistance that we had spent, again, US taxpayer money to try to build an independent investigator unit to go after corrupt prosecutors. And there was a case called the Diamond Prosecutor Case in which Shokin destroyed the entire ecosystem that we were trying to help create, the investigators, the judges who issued the warrants, the law enforcement that had warrants to do the wire tapping, everybody to protect his former driver who he’d made a prosecutor. That’s what Joe Biden was asking, remove the corrupt prosecutor so-
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Referring to the requests in July?
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I would not say so. No, sir.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To my understanding, the then prosecutor general of Ukraine, now ex, Yuriy Lutsenko, met Rudy Giuliani in New York on a private visit in January. They had a second meeting in February. And through the good offices of the former mayor of New York, Yuriy Lutsenko gave an interview to John Solomon, then of The Hill, in early March, and the campaign was launched on March 20th.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have every reason to believe it is not true.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Yuriy Lutsenko was a politician of longstanding. He had been Minister of Interior after the Orange Revolution. The U.S. Embassy had good relations with him for years. He was imprisoned by President Yanukovych, came out, was elected majority leader of Poroshenko, the then president’s party, and then became prosecutor general in the spring of 2016.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	She was dedicated, as is every U.S. government official in Ukraine, to help Ukrainians to overcome the legacy of corruption, which they actually have made a number of important steps since 2014.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I asked her to extend until the end of this year to get through the election cycle in Ukraine, and then Under Secretary Hale, in March, asked her to stay until 2020.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	As I mentioned in my testimony, you can’t promote a principled anti-corruption action without pissing off corrupt people.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	They did.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I cannot judge that. What I can say is that Rudy Giuliani’s smear campaign was ubiquitous in the spring of 2019 on Fox News and on the Internet and Twittersphere.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I believe Kurt Volker has served the U.S. as a public servant, very well.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I believe Ambassador Volker’s deposition was over 400 pages, and I don’t have it in front of me, so I can’t [crosstalk 00:02:01]-
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have no basis to make that judgment, no sir.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Do not believe it was certified by May. I would defer to my colleague, Laura Cooper, who has testified [crosstalk 00:00:11] unclosed door, [crosstalk 00:00:12] but-
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It had not been done by May, because when I was visiting in May, I was asked by Laura to raise a specific issue that would meet the conditionality.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Yes, sir. I think it may have been in the July timeframe.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	We both received, I believe, I received initially a letter directing me not to appear. And once the committees issued a subpoena, I was under legal obligation to appear, and I am here today under subpoena.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	We’re both here under subpoena. I don’t think either of us is going to comment why others have not shown up.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I was not, and I would never participate in an arrangement to have them announce investigations.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Those appear to be the same issues that were mentioned in the call as well as the media campaign that started in March, led by Rudy Giuliani.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	When this exchange happened on August 10, I was not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	As Ambassador Taylor referenced earlier, in his testimony in oral answering, he heard on August 16. He then called me and we had a conversation, and at that point, I memorialized my concerns in a note to the file.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That would be my understanding
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I don’t recall, but it would be a matter of record now that it’s been released.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I would, say first of all as I repeated before, a president has the right to recall ambassadors. It remains a matter of policy of the United States towards Ukraine to help them overcome a legacy of corruption in creating new institutions. And much of what we’ve been discussing today, which involved in a regular channel, was a request that went against US policy that would have undermined the rule of law and our longstanding policy goals in Ukraine, as in other countries in the post-Soviet space.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	No, they weren’t.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I said that, and I believe it’s true.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I believe it makes it more difficult for our diplomatic representatives overseas to carry out those policy goals, yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Well, there’s a issue of credibility. They hear diplomats on the ground saying one thing, and they hear other US leaders saying something else.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Thank you for the question. First of all, I’m not an ambassador.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I will repeat, I think on principle, regardless of the country, whether it’s Ukraine, the U.S. or any country, the facts of law, criminal nexus should drive investigations by law enforcement officials and it is not the role of politicians to be involved in directing the judicial systems of their own country or other countries.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is correct, ma’am.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I think the right of the president to make a decision about the president’s personal representative as confirmed by the senate is separate from whatever happens outside the confines of U.S. government processes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Well, I guess it probably depends on the motivation of other people and I am not one of them.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	No, he was not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I believe he was looking to dig up political dirt against a potential rival in the next election cycle.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	All federal government employees are subject to the Hatch Act and our actions are supposed to be promoting policy and not involved in partisan politics.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Agree.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I have turned all records that I had in my possession to the State Department, because whatever we do is considered a federal record, not a personal record.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	No, it was not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I do not know for sure, but my understanding is, once the list left the NSC staff, it went through review through the part of the White House that determines presidential delegations.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is my understanding, yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I never saw any document that changed the nature of policy determination. In the US government, under the Trump Administration, there’s the National Security Presidential-
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Yes please.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That was an accurate statement. Their feeling doesn’t mean that they actually got delegated responsibility.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I referenced that after watching Gordon Sunderland say that on Ukrainian TV on July 26.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	My understanding of Ambassador Sunderland’s use of that term is that the three people that were in charge of Ukraine policy during the summer were he, Gordon Sunderland, Ambassador Volker and Secretary Perry.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I first heard about former mayor Giuliani’s interest in Ukraine in January of this year. That was a different phase than what happened during the summertime.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I did not find his particular engagement normal, no.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I was on vacation. I was on vacation when his cable came in, but my understanding is it made it to its recipient, intended recipient, Secretary Pompeo.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I honestly can’t say for sure what happened with the cable once the message was brought in at the highest level.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I believe, to be the best of my understanding, the vice president was an advocate for the release of the assistance.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It’s a problem, and they’re taking steps to address it.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	No one is above the law, sir.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	The certification in that case is done by the Secretary of Defense upon advice of his staff, in consultation with the interagency community. We were fully supportive of that conditionality, and the Secretary of Defense had already certified that that conditionality had been met.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It takes a while once money is obligated to actually reach the country. There were two island-class ships that just arrived in the Port of Odessa and that was with prior year money, so there’s about a lag of a year.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	100%.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It was after the article in Politico came out in that first intense week of September.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Are you referring to the statement that was being negotiated between Kurt Volker, Gordon Sondland and Andrey Yermak?
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That was not an anti-corruption statement, sir.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I think if you go back to the back and forth, the WhatsApps that were shared by Kurt Volker, they shared a draft with Rudy Giuliani and Rudy Giuliani said it would not be acceptable if it didn’t mention Biden, Burisma in 2016.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	No statement of that sort was issued, correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I did.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It remains so.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Correct. Detailed to the embassy in Kiev as the acting deputy chief of mission.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That is stolen assets that were in the name of the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky. He was the one who we believed had stolen the money.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct. It was launched in May 2014 by the Attorney General of the US and UK, in conjunction with the World Bank.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Well, as we’ve talked earlier today, the possibility of a White House meeting was being held contingent to an announcement.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	New leaders, particularly countries that are trying to have good footing in the international arena, see a meeting with the US president in the oval office at the White House as the ultimate sign of endorsement and support from the United States.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct. He was elected on April 21st and his government was formed after parliamentary elections in July.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It would primarily boost his leverage to negotiate with Vladimir Putin about the Russian occupation of 7% of Ukrainian territory.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	It is not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	In my opinion, it is not.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Because our policies, particularly in promoting the rule of law, are designed to help countries, and in Eastern Europe and central Europe, that is overcoming the legacy of communism. In the communist system in particular, the prosecutor general office was used to suppress and persecute citizens, not promote the rule of law. So in helping these countries reach their own aspirations to join the Western community of nations and live lives of dignity, helping them have the rule of law with strong institutions is the purpose of our policy.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Correct. And in fact, as a matter of policy not of programming, we oftentimes raise our concerns usually in private with countries that we feel are engaged in selective political prosecution and persecution of their opponents.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Not to my knowledge.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I cannot interpret the mind of President Zelensky, other than to say that it was very clear that what they were hoping to get out of this meeting was a date and a confirmation that he could come to Washington.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Well, if you go further into the call record as part of this, and we don’t have it on screen, but to the best of my recollection reading it after it was released in September 25th, President Zelensky went into having … ” Whatever your problems were, that was the old team. I’ve got a new team and we will do whatever’s appropriate and be transparent and honest about it.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I don’t remember the exact words, but he was trying to be, in his own words and response, be responsive to conduct the business of Ukrainian government in a transparent and honest manner.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To be honest, I had not heard of CrowdStrike until I read this transcript on September 25th.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I understand it has to do with the story that there’s a server with missing emails. I also understand that one of the owners of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American. I am not aware of any Ukrainian connection to the company.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Yes. That is my understanding.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	To my knowledge, there is no factual basis. No.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I think it’s amply clear that Russian interference was at the heart of the interference in the 2016 election cycle.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	I am.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	None whatsoever.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	He did.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Yes.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	Perhaps.
2019-11-13	George Kent	W-Kent	W-Kent	That’s a fair assessment.
2019-12-09	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	They were not.
2019-12-09	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I do not. We were hoping. We recommended the president very clearly support what President Zelensky had run on in his own election and what his servant of the people party had run on and its election where it received a majority of mandate.
2019-12-09	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Chairman Schiff, Ranking Member Nunes and members of the committee, I appear before you today under subpoena to answer your questions about my time as senior director for European affairs at the White House and the National Security Council, as related to Ukraine and US security assistance to that country. I will provide you the most complete and accurate information I can, consistent with my obligations to protect classified and privileged information. Whether the conduct that is the subject of this inquiry merits impeachment is a question for the US House of Representatives.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I appear here today only to provide factual information based upon my knowledge and recollection of events. I will not waste time restating the details of my opening statement from my deposition on October 31, 2019, which has recently been made public. However, I will highlight the following key points: first, as I previously stated, I do not know who the whistleblower is nor do I intend to speculate as to who the individual may be. Second, I have great respect for my former colleagues from the NSC and the rest of the interagency.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I am not here today to question their character or integrity. My recollections and judgments are my own. Some of my colleagues’ recollections of conversations and interactions may differ from mine, but I do not view those differences as the result of an untoward purpose. Third, I continue to believe Ukraine is on the front lines of a strategic competition between the West and Vladimir Putin’s revanchist Russia. Russia is a failing power, but it is still a dangerous one. The United States aids Ukraine and her people so they can fight Russia over there and we don’t have to fight Russia here.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty has been a bipartisan objective since Russia’s military invasion in 2014. It must continue to be. As I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call, on July 25th, how its disclosure would play in Washington’s political climate. My fears have been realized. I understand the gravity of these proceedings, but I beg you not to lose sight of the military conflict underway in Eastern Ukraine today. The ongoing illegal occupation of Crimea and the importance of reform of Ukraine’s politics and economy.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Every day that the focus of discussion involving Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interest of Ukraine, the United States, and Western-style liberalism share. Finally, I concluded my act of service at the National Security Council the day after I last appeared before you. I left the NSC completely of my own volition. I felt no pressure to resign nor have I feared any retaliation from my testimony. I made this career choice sometime before I decided to testify on October 31st. I’m prepared to answer your questions to the best of my ability and recollection.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I officially took over on the 15th, approximately 10 days, very few days actually in the office.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I did.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	On some, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	They had.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	The NSC staff did, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	They were.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	We operate under what’s known as NSPM-4, National Security Presidential Memorandum-4 it’s available on the internet. That lays out how the President wants to be provided options for his decision.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sometimes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I did.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	The White House Situation Room.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I was hoping for a more full-throated statement of support from the President concerning President Zelensky’s reform agenda. Given where we were at the time with respect to the overwhelming mandate, President Zelensky Servant of the Party people had received in the Rada election.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sounds right.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	They received more than a majority in their own right.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	At the time.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	There was broad support for giving President Zelensky a chance.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Approximately three months, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	They were not.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I was not aware of much of this at the time.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I did not understand any instruction to do so.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	During the period in which Dr. Hill and I were conducting handoff meetings so that I could be up to speed on the various things that were occurring in the portfolio at the time. She mentioned the traditional NSPM-4 process and the parallel process. And in the context of discussing the parallel process, she mentioned issues like Burisma, which were noteworthy to me at the time because I had never heard of them before. And upon hearing them in the call, it wound up confirming, okay, there there’s something here.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	As I recall, it was definitely Ambassador Sondland and I believe Mr. Giuliani.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	After that particular a handoff meeting, I proceeded to look it up on the internet. I Googled it.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It’s not what we recommended that the President discuss.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I recommended we restrict access to the package.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I did.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It was a mistake.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It was an administrative error.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I believe I could have instructed the appropriate staff to do so, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Well, I was also concerned that based on the participants in the listening room that day, I did not then, and I do not now recall any representatives from the NSC legal advisor’s office, as they were often on head of state calls, but not always. And I wanted to make sure that John Eisenberg as the legal advisor and his deputy were aware to review this particular transcript.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct and political consequences was an umbrella term I used in my statement to describe a series of effects I feared about what would happen if and when the content of the transcript or the content of the [inaudible 01:05:34] leaked.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I likely would have.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I did not.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I did not at the time. I think I have an understanding now.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	There seems to have been discussions about a statement, various drafts of which have been discussed in various proceedings.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I was in Warsaw when the vice president was designated as the president’s representative. I was accompanying Ambassador Bolton.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I was.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It was the first issue that President Zelensky raised with Vice President Pence. They were very interested. They talked about its importance to Ukraine, its important to the relationship.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	The vice president represented that it was a priority for him and that we were working to address, and he characterized President Trump’s concerns about the state of corruption in Ukraine and the president’s prioritization of getting the Europeans to contribute more to security sector assistance.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I don’t know that he necessarily acknowledged a hold. He mentioned that we were reviewing the assistance, and that’s the way I heard it. That’s the way I would characterize it. And those were the points he raised to help President Zelensky understand where we were in our process.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Well we were. We had been running a review. We had been running an inter-agency process to provide the president the information that I had been directed to generate for the president’s consideration as to the state of inter-agency support for continuing Ukraine security sector assistance.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I mean it was, President Zelensky left the room. Vice President Pence left the room. And in sort of an anteroom, Ambassador Sondland and presidential advisor Yermak had this discussion. Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That the Ukrainians would have to have the prosecutor general make a statement with respect to the investigations as a condition of having the aid lifted.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Well, I was concerned about what I saw as essentially an additional hurdle to accomplishing what I had been directed to help accomplish, which was giving the president the information he needed to determine that the security sector assistance could go forward.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	There was the appearance of one based on what Ambassador Sondland represented.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I promptly reached out to Ambassador Taylor to schedule a secure phone call.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	About that conversation, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I reached out to him as well and requested his availability for a secure phone call.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Tell the lawyers.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	When I returned to the states, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	He did not.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That sounds correct, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	If I recall this conversation correctly, this was where Ambassador Sondland related that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky had to make the statement and that he had to want to do it.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I think I did, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I understood that that’s what Ambassador Sondland believed
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That’s what he represented.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Well, I believe if we’re all on September 7th, the end of the fiscal year, September 30th, these are one year dollars, the DOD and the Department Of State funds. So we only had so much time. And in fact, because Congress imposed a 15 day notification requirement on the state department funds September 7th, September 30th, that really means September 15th in order to secure a decision from the president to allow the funds to go forward.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I did, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	He said to tell the lawyers.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	He did not explain his direction.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Again, I don’t know why he directed that, but it seemed reasonable and it’s consistent with what I was going to do anyway.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I was concerned about what Ambassador Sondland was saying were requirements, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	By this point, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I believe we had one conversation.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I believe on or about September 6th, Ambassador Volker was in town to provide an update on some of his activities, and he provided that update and then we had a one on one conversation about this track, the separate process.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I think I was interested in understanding his understanding of events.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I think I was primarily on receive mode.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I don’t believe so, no.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	We received a number of those requests. I have a general recollection of one as related to Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	As I understand it, the president gave that direction the evening of September 11th.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I believe I was familiar with the letter from the three committee chairman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I would argue Ambassador Bolton would be.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I was a senior official, yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	The president was concerned that the United States seemed to bear the exclusive brunt of security assistance to Ukraine. He wanted to see the Europeans step up and contribute more security assistance.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	We were surveying the data to understand who was contributing what and sort of in what categories.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Ambassador Bolton had a meeting with President Zelensky and I staffed that meeting.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	As I recall, the date of the meeting between Ambassador Bolton and President Zelensky was actually the first day of the new Rata.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	A new prosecutor general, a brand new cabinet. Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, eliminating parliamentary immunity.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes. The Ukrainians, with whom we met, were by all appearances exhausted, from the pace of activity.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, he was.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Quite.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Well, we had a few stops between Ukraine and Poland, but yes, Ambassador Bolton proceeded to Warsaw, where we were expecting to ensure everything was staged properly, for the President’s arrival.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I did not.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	He did.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	So, I was not there. The issue I remember most starkly was Ambassador Bolton was quite annoyed that Ambassador [inaudible 01:46:10] had crashed the pre-brief.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	But the Ambassador had everything he needed to ensure that, either the President, or the Vice President were well-prepared.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I didn’t need to. I was… Ambassador Bolton was there.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That’s my understanding.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	He had been for some time, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	We had a reduced schedule, from what had been arranged for the precedent, for the Vice President, but the Vice President met with President Duda, of Poland, and he met with President Zelensky, and I participated in both meetings.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It seemed very positive. Very [crosstalk 01:47:13].
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	He represented his support for the aid. He represented the strong commitment of the United States to Ukraine, and he explained that President Trump, because this is after the Politico article had come out, that made clear there was a hold, he explained that what we were doing was the United States government, the inter agency, was examining what more Europe could do in the security space, and taking a look at how Ukraine was reforming what has been a history of corruption.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That’s correct. Ambassador Taylor and I had a number of phone calls where we, in fact, talked about, “Do the Ukrainians know yet,” because we both felt very strongly it was important that we ensure that the President was able to make the decision to release the aid before the Ukrainians ever found out about it.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	So, I think I articulated two concerns. If I’m forgetting one, please remind me, but the two concerns I had were, one, I did not see representatives of NSC legal on the call, and so I wanted to make sure that the legal advisor and his deputy were aware of the call. I was also concerned about taking steps to protect the Memcon limited it’s disclosure, for fear of the consequences of it leaking.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I want to be precise about the lexicon here. I did not ask for it to be moved to a compartmented system.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I wanted access to be restricted.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Well, it was represented to me that it was a mistake. I was trying to pull up that Memcon, because we were in the process of pulling together Ambassador Bolton’s materials, and the President’s materials, for what was a plan bilat between POTUS and President Zelensky. When I went to do that, I could not pull up the package in our system, and I did not understand why. I spoke with the NSC executive Secretariat Staff, asked them why, and they did their research, and they informed me it had been moved to the higher classification system, at the direction of John Eisenberg, whom I then asked why. If that was the judgment he made, that’s not necessarily mine to question, but I didn’t understand it. He essentially told me, “I gave no such direction.” He did his own inquiry, and he represented back to me that it was his understanding was it is an administrative error, that when he also gave direction to restrict access, the executive Secretariat staff understood that as an apprehension that there was something in the content of the Memcon that could not exist on the lower classification system.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Once it was moved to the compartmented system?
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Essentially. Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes. We look at, shorthand, we’ll call it a transcript, but the memorandum of conversation, and we ensure that that transcription is as close to accurate as possible, given our requirements under the Presidential Records Act.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I viewed it as complete and accurate.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I understand that he said in either this proceeding, or the deposition that he wanted that request, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I don’t recall that. It was my practice if I believed an edit accurately represented the call, I would accept it. If I didn’t hear it in the call, if it didn’t exist in my notes, I wouldn’t have made the edit.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Not that I can recall.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Not that I can recall.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	when we were discussing the track changes version of the Memcon, I believe he had some concerns about the call. I believe we both agreed we wanted that more full throated embrace of President Zelensky, and his reform agenda, and we didn’t get it.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Not as such. It was more of a overarching statement from her, and her deputy, who became my deputy, that they had concerns about judgment.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	There were-
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	You did ask that, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Others had represented that, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	One, if he had concerns about something about the content of the call, that’s something I would expected to have been notified of. I also think, just as a matter of practice, since we both went to the lawyers, we didn’t necessarily both need to, and economy of effort may have prevailed.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Well, I think the easiest way to say it is he was concerned with respect to, for example, the Ukraine trip, that he did not go. He asked me why. It was my practice to have a number of the conversations with Ambassador Taylor one-on-one, and there were certain other matters.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I explained to him my thinking, and that was that.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	We had a number of handoff discussions between one July and 15 July.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I had heard about it from Dr. Hill.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I don’t know that I had any understanding. These are emails? July 13 emails. I wasn’t even in the seat yet. But I knew that among the head of state meetings we were attempting to schedule, was one between the President and President Zelensky.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Not necessarily.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Because among the discussions I had with Dr. Hill were about Ambassador Sondland. I think she might’ve coined it the Gordon problem. And I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Sondland was doing. I didn’t necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested, that he believed were important. So he wanted to get a meeting. I understood that the President wanted to do, and had agreed to a meeting. And so I was tracking that we needed to schedule a meeting.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That is my testimony.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	As a hypothetical matter, I do not.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Mr. Chairman, I can only tell you what I was thinking at the time. That is not what I understood the President to be doing.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I believe I stated I had three concerns about what the impact of a call leaking might be.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No. Well, no, I would still have a concern about it leaking.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	In those hypothetical cases, no. Not appropriate.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, again, I can always speak to what I understood at the time. And why I acted the way I did at the time.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No Chairman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Mr. Turner, I’m a US Naval…
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Mr. Turner. I’m a US Naval Reserve Officer. I’m an intelligence officer.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	George Washington University.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	He did, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I agree, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I believe so, yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir. Well, sir, I don’t believe he did.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, it was the first I heard of much of this.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That was what I was advised by Dr. Hill.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, what we, myself, Colonel Vindman, others, what we prepared in the package we provided the president was background on President Zelensky, background on his positions about reforming Ukraine, reforming its institutions, rooting out corruption. We were hoping, we recommended the president very clearly support what President Zelensky had run on and his own election, and what his servant of the people party had run on in its election where it received a majority mandate.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Corruption reform?
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, it’s been some time since I refreshed myself on the discussion that took place at the UN General Assembly, so I hesitate to say did he ever raise it, but he did not raise it at the time of the 25 July phone call.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I can’t speak to that, but I would generally agree that ambassadors work for the Secretary of State and the president.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Ambassadors don’t work for the National Security Advisor sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I’m sorry. Was there a question?
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I agree with that, but I would also add the hold, as I understood it applied to Ukraine security systems, UASI, UASI and FMF, it did not apply to FMS, and the javelins were provided under FMS.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I would have accepted all of the edits that I believed were faithful to what was actually discussed.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I don’t recall that specifically, sir, no.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	We got the draft, as was normal, fairly quickly after the call, that same day.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I believe that’s generally correct, yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I don’t have any firsthand knowledge of that, no, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir. I have no firsthand knowledge of that.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir. I do not.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Ma’am, I didn’t believe or disbelieve them. I’m merely relating what they told me.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, ma’am. No, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Ma’am. I’m sorry. Chairman, if I could answer.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, ma’am, that’s incorrect. They, Dr. Hill, Mr. Erath, others in the NSC, raised concerns about Alex. Those concerns were noted. I didn’t take them for face value. I treated them as representations of others. I was on alert, but I formed my own judgments. I took no action because of the statements of someone else that I couldn’t independently validate.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, they are patriots, yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Not that I’m aware of, Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Not that I’m aware of, Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That is correct, Councilwoman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Not to my knowledge, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, Congressman, he did.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, can you point to where I testified to that?
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, this is 226?
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I just want to be … I want to be clear characterizing it. Okay. Yes, sir. I see. Yes.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Ambassador Bolton did not yet believe the president was ready to approve the assistance.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Well, sir, I would say he decides-
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	He sets it. Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	My oath is to obey all lawful orders.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	July 25th, yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, sir. He made a request.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Never, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, it was not a policy objective that I was aware of.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I did not understand it as a policy objective.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No, sir. I heard the President make a request. I received no direction at any time to attempt to weed a policy process different from what I laid out in my deposition. I was directed by Dr. Copperman to launch an inter agency process to ensure a unity of opinion in the inter agency as to the importance of continuing security sector assistance. And that’s what I did. I acted upon the direction I was given.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, the President.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, the NSC staff exists to ensure the President has a full array of options for his decision.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It was, he sent me an email, sir. It was a very succinct, it was a list of three items. It was a very succinct item with respect to Ukraine. I briefed the President on the call.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That is correct Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, that is how I was able to confirm it.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir, he did not.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I agree with Ambassador Volker sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes Congressman.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I have no recollection of him doing that.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I’ve been trying to stay on the safe side of making legal conclusions, but no sir, I did not hear him make any sort of demand.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I do, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I’m not a lawyer for the United States, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It did not, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It did not, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I attended the [bylat 01:44:32] in New York at the UN General Assembly and he made clear at the time in front of the press that he felt no pressure.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I made no judgment about any illegal conduct occurring.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No sir, I don’t believe he did.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I don’t believe he did.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Correct sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	That is correct, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I’m not intimately familiar with the whistleblower complaint, but I did not hear a demand in that call.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It is sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It is sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	It is sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I believe so, yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I believe I stated that I was aware that there were those who were concerned about that yesterday.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I watched part of the proceedings this morning. I heard him say that. Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I don’t know that the contents leaked out. There was a whistleblower complaint. The President chose to declassify the memcon.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	In that hypothetical, no I don’t think he should do that.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes sir. I would agree with that hypothetical.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir, I haven’t been promoted-
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Sir the rule of law is central to our democracy.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Ma’am, I don’t agree with the premise, no.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Again, I don’t agree with the premise, ma’am. I don’t think I did skip my chain of command. If I had seen something wrong, I would have-
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	The Deputy National Security Advisor.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Dr. Charles Cupperman, at the time.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	No. No, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Ma’am, if I may, I viewed my engagement with the NSC legal advisor as one largely focused on administrative matters. I was interested in locking down the transcript, that’s an administrative matter. I was interested in making sure that the legal advisor was aware of the call, because I didn’t see anybody from the legal advisor’s office [crosstalk 02:09:20]-
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Because I did not see anybody from the legal advisor’s office in the listening room and I wanted to make sure somebody from the legal advisor’s office was aware and I wanted to make sure it was a senior person.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	I wanted them to be aware of the call, because I wanted to know what had transpired.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	My equivalent, the head of NSC legal, was and is John Eisenberg. He was my equivalent in that position. I wouldn’t go to somebody subordinate to him, I would go to him to express my concerns [crosstalk 02:10:14].
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Yes, ma’am. Yes, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Tim Morrison	W-Morrison	W-Morrison	Ma’am, approximately… Well, I guess not approximately. July 15 to October 31 or so.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I appreciate the opportunity to speak again to the members of this committee. First, let me offer my thanks to the men and women of the US Department of State, who have committed their professional lives to support the foreign policy work of the United States. In particular, I want to thank my staff at the US Mission to the European Union. Your integrity, dedication, and hard work often performed without public acclaim or recognition serve as a shining example of true public service. And I am personally grateful to work beside you each and every day.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It is my honor to serve as the US Ambassador to the European Union. The US Mission to the EU is the direct link between the United States and the European Union and its members. America’s longest standing allies and one of the largest economic blocks in the world. Every day I work to support a strong, united and peaceful Europe. Strengthening our ties with Europe serves both American and European goals as we together promote political stability and economic prosperity around the world.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I expect that few Americans have heard my name before these events. So before I begin my substantive testimony, please let me share some of my personal background. My parents fled Europe during the Holocaust. Escaping the atrocities of that time, my parents left Germany for Uruguay and then in 1953 emigrated to Seattle, Washington, where I was born and raised. Like so many immigrants, my family was eager for freedom and hungry for opportunity. They raised my sister and me to be humble, hardworking and patriotic and I am forever grateful for the sacrifices they made on our behalf.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Public service has always been important to me. As a lifelong Republican, I have contributed to initiatives of both Republican and Democratic administrations. In 2003, I served as a member of the transition team for Oregon Democratic Governor Ted Kulongoski. Governor Kulongoski also appointed me to serve on various statewide boards. In 2007, President George W. Bush appointed me as a member of the Commission on White House Fellows. I worked with President Bush on charitable events for his foundation’s military service initiative. And I also worked briefly with former Vice President Joe Biden’s office in connection with the vice president’s nationwide anti-cancer initiative at a local Northwest hospital.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	And of course the highest honor in my public life came when President Trump asked me to serve as the United States Ambassador to the European Union. The Senate confirmed me as an ambassador on a bipartisan voice vote and I assumed the role in Brussels on July 9th, 2018. Although today is my first public testimony on the Ukraine matters, this is not my first time cooperating with this committee. As you know, I’ve already provided 10 hours of deposition testimony. And I did so despite directives from the White House and the State Department that I refused to appear as many others have done. I agreed to testify because I respect the gravity of the moment and I believe I have an obligation to account fully for my role in these events.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	But I also must acknowledge that this process has been challenging. And in many respects, less than fair. I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails and many, many other State Department documents. And I was told I could not work with my EU staff to pull together the relevant files and information. Having access to the State Department materials would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	As ambassador, I’ve had hundreds of meetings and calls with individuals, but I’m not a note taker or a memo writer. Never have been. My job requires that I speak with heads of state, senior government officials, members of the cabinet, the president almost each and every day. Talking with foreign leaders might be memorable to some people, but this is my job. I do it all the time. My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials. Yet these materials were not provided to me and they have also refused to share these materials with this committee. These documents are not classified. And in fairness should have been made available.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	In the absence of these materials, my memory, admittedly, has not been perfect. And I have no doubt that a more fair, open and orderly process of allowing me to read the State Department records and other materials would have made this process far more transparent. I don’t intend to repeat my prior opening statement or attempt to summarize 10 hours of previous deposition testimony. However, a few critical points have been obscured by noise over the last few days and weeks and I’m worried that the bigger picture is being ignored. So let me make a few key points.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	First, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States. We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refuse to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Second, although we disagreed with the need to involve Mr. Giuliani at the time, we did not believe that his role was improper. As I previously testified, if I had known of all of Mr. Giuliani’s dealings or his associations with individuals, some of whom are now under criminal indictment, I personally would not have acquiesced to his participation. Still, given what we knew at the time, what we were asked to do did not appear to be wrong.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Third, let me say precisely because we did not think that we were engaging in improper behavior, we made every effort to ensure that the relevant decision makers at the National Security Council and the State Department knew the important details of our efforts. The suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false. I have now identified certain State Department emails and messages that provide contemporaneous support for my view. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the National Security Council, and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts from May 23rd, 2019 until the security aid was released on September 11th, 2019. I will quote from some of those messages with shortly.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Fourth, as I testified previously, Mr. Giuliani’s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election, DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States and we knew these investigations were important to the president.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Fifth, in July and August of 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I was adamantly opposed to any suspension of aid. I was adamantly opposed to any suspension of aid as the Ukrainians needed those funds to fight against Russian aggression. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven’t to this day. In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma as Mr. Giuliani had demanded. I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson and I also shared my concerns with the Ukrainians.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Finally, at all times, I was acting in good faith. I was acting in good faith. As a presidential appointee, I followed the directions of the president. We worked with Mr. Giuliani because the president directed us to do so. We had no desire to set any conditions. We had no desire to set any conditions on the Ukrainians. Indeed, my own personal view, which I shared repeatedly with others, was that the White House and security assistance should have proceeded without preconditions of any kind. We were working to overcome the problems given the facts as they existed. Our only interest, and my only interest, was to advance longstanding US policy and to support Ukraine’s fragile democracy.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Now let me provide additional details specifically about Ukraine and my involvement. First, my very first days as ambassador to the EU, which was starting back in July of 2018, Ukraine has featured prominently in my broader portfolio. Ukraine’s political and economic development are critical to the long standing and long lasting stability of Europe. Moreover, the conflict in eastern Ukraine and Crimea remains one of the most significant security crisis for Europe and the United States. Our efforts to counterbalance an aggressive Russia depend in substantial part on a strong Ukraine.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	On April 21st, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine in an historic election. With the expressed support of Secretary Pompeo, I attended President Zelensky’s inauguration on May 20th as part of the US delegation, which was led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The US delegation also included Senator Johnson, Ukraine special envoy Volker and Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vindman of the National Security Council.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	My attendance at President Zelensky’s inauguration was not my first involvement with Ukraine. As I testified previously, just four days after assuming my post as ambassador in July of 2018, I received an official delegation from the government of then Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko. The meeting took place at the US Mission in Brussels and was prearranged by my career EU Mission staff. And I’ve had several meetings since then in Brussels. Later in February of 2019, I worked well with US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in making my first official visit to Ukraine for a US Navy visit to the strategic Black Sea port of Odessa.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	And the reason I raise these prior Ukraine activities, the meetings in Brussels, my visit to Odessa, is to emphasize that Ukraine has been a part of my portfolio from my very first days as the US Ambassador. Any claim that I somehow muscled my way into the Ukraine relationship is simply false. During the Zelensky inauguration on May 20th, the US delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government We were impressed by President Zelensky’s desire to promote a stronger relationship with the United States. We admired his commitment to reform and we were excited about the possible-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Commitment to reform and we were excited about the possibility of Ukraine making the changes necessary to support a greater western economic investment. And, we were excited that Ukraine might, after years and years of lip service, finally get serious about addressing its own well-known corruption problems. With that enthusiasm, we returned the White House on May 23rd to brief President Trump. We advised the president of the strategic importance of Ukraine and the value of strengthening the relationship with President Zelensky. To support this reformer, we asked the White House for two things. First, a working phone call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, and second, a working oval office visit. In our view, both were vital to cementing the US-Ukraine relationship, demonstrating support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression and advancing broader US foreign policy interests.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. He expressed concerns that the Ukrainian government was not serious about reform and he even mentioned that Ukraine tried to take him down in the last election. In response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to, “talk with Rudy.” We understood that talk with Rudy meant, talk with Mr. Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer. Let me say again, we weren’t happy with the president’s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani. I believe then, as I do now, that the men and women of the state department, not the president’s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for Ukraine matters.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Nonetheless, based on the president’s direction we were faced with a choice, we could abandon the efforts to schedule the White House phone call and a White House visit between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, which was unquestionably in our foreign policy interest, or we could do as President Trump had directed and talk with Rudy. We chose the latter course, not because we liked it, but because it was the only constructive path open to us.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Over the course of the next several months, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I were in communication with Mr. Giuliani. Secretary Perry volunteered to make the initial calls with Mr. Giuliani given their prior relationship. Ambassador Volker made several of the early calls and generally informed us of what was discussed.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I first communicated with Mr. Giuliani in early August, several months later. Mr. Giuliani emphasized that the president wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into the corruption issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election, including the DNC server and Burisma, as two topics of importance to the president.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	We kept the leadership of the state department and the NSC, informed of our activities. And that included communications with Secretary of State Pompeo, his counselor, Ulrich Brechbuhl, his executive secretary, Lisa Kenna, and also communications with Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, Mr. Morrison, and their staff at the NSC. They knew what we were doing and why.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	On July 10th, 2019 Senior Ukrainian national security officials met with Ambassador Bolton, Ambassador Volker, Dr. Hill, Secretary Perry, myself, and several others in Washington DC. During that meeting, we all discussed the importance of the two action items I identified earlier. One, a working phone call, and two, a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky. From my perspective, the July 10th meeting was a positive step toward accomplishing our shared goals. While I am now aware of accounts of the meeting from Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Veneman, their recollections of those events simply don’t square with my own or with those of Ambassador Volker or Secretary Perry.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I recall mentioning the prerequisite of investigations before any White House call or meeting, but I do not recall any yelling or screaming or abrupt terminations as others have said. Instead, after the meeting, Ambassador Bolton walked outside with our group and we all took some great pictures together outside on the White House lawn. More important, those recollections of protests do not square with the documentary record of our interactions with the NSC in the days and weeks that followed. We kept the NSC apprised of our efforts, including, specifically, our efforts to a public statement from the Ukrainians that would satisfy President Trump’s concerns.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	For example, on July 13th, and this is three days after that July 10th meeting, I emailed Tim Morrison. He had just taken over Dr. Hill’s post as the NSC Eurasia Director and I met him that day for the first time. I wrote to Mr. Morrison with these words, “The call between Zelensky and POTUS, President of the United States, should happen before 7/21, which is the parliamentary elections in Ukraine. Sole purpose is for Zelensky to give POTUS assurances of new sheriff in town, corruption ending, un-bundling moving forward,” and I emphasize, “any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently. Goal is for POTUS to invite him to oval. Volker, Perry, Bolton, and I strongly recommend.” Mr. Morrison acknowledged and said, “Thank you,” and specifically noted that he was tracking these issues.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, there was no secret regarding moving forward and the discussion of investigations. Moreover, I have reviewed other state department documents, some of which are not currently in the public domain, detailing Mr. Giuliani’s efforts. For example, on July 10th, the very same day that Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry, and I were meeting with the Ukraine officials in Washington, Ambassador Taylor received a communication that Mr. Giuliani was still talking with Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenkoin. In WhatsApp messages with Ambassador Volker and I, Ambassador Taylor wrote to us as follows, “Just had a meeting with Andre and Vadim,” referring to Ukraine Foreign Minister Vadim Prystaiko. “Taylor said the Ukrainians were, “Very concerned about what Lutsenkoin told them,” that according to RG,” meaning Rudy Giuliani, “the Zelensky POTUS meeting will not happen.” Volcker responded, “Good grief. Please tell the deem to let the official US government representatives speak for the US. Lutsenkoin has his own self interest here.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Taylor confirmed that he had communicated that message to the Ukrainians and he added, “I briefed Ulrich this afternoon on this,” referring to State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl. Again, everyone’s in the loop. Three things are critical about this WhatsApp exchange. First, while the Ukrainians were in Washington at the White House, Mr. Giuliani was communicating with the Ukrainians without our knowledge. Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and I were all surprised by this. Second, Mr. Giuliani was communicating with the, reportedly, corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor, Lutsenkoin and discussing whether a Zelensky-Trump meeting was going to happen again, without our knowledge. And third, with this alarming news, Ambassador Taylor briefed Ulrich Brechbuhl, who is the counselor to Secretary of State Pompeo. And even as late as September 24th of this year, Secretary Pompeo was directing Kurt Volker to speak with Mr. Giuliani. In a WhatsApp message, Kurt Volker told me in part, “Spoke with Rudy per guidance from S.” S is the state department’s official designator for the secretary. “Spoke with Rudy per guidance from S.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Look, we tried our best to fix the problem while keeping the state department and the NSC closely apprised of the challenges we faced. On July 25th Presidents Trump and Zelensky had their official call. I was not on the call and I don’t think I was invited to be on the call. In fact, I first read the transcript on September 25th, the day it was publicly released. All I had heard at that time, was that the call had gone well. Looking back, I find it very odd, very odd, that neither I nor Ambassador Taylor, nor Ambassador Volker, ever received a detailed readout of that call with the Biden references.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Now, there are people who say they had concerns about the call, but no one shared any concerns about the call with me at the time, which frankly would have been very helpful to know. On July 26th Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and I were all in Kyiv to meet with President Zelensky. The timing of that trip, immediately after the call between Presidents Trump in Zelensky, was entirely, entirely coincidental. The key of meetings had been scheduled well before the date that the White House finally fixed the call. During our Kyiv meeting, I do not recall President Zelensky discussing the substance of his July 25th call with President Trump, nor did he discuss any request investigate Vice President Biden, which we all later learned was discussed on the July 25th call. And this is consistent with the reported comments from Ambassadors Volker and Taylor.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	After the Zelensky meeting, I also met with the Zelensky’s senior aide, Andriy Yermak. I don’t recall the specifics of our conversation, but I believe the issue was probably a part of that agenda or meeting. Also on July 26, shortly after our Kyiv meetings, I spoke by phone with President Trump. The White House, which has finally, finally shared certain call dates and times with my attorneys, confirms this. The call lasted five minutes. I remember I was at a restaurant in Kyiv and I have no reason to doubt that this conversation included the subject of investigations. Again, given Mr. Giuliani’s demand that President Zelensky make a public statement about investigations, I knew that investigations were important to President Trump. We did not discuss any classified information.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call. For the most part, I have no reason to doubt their accounts. It’s true that the president speaks loudly at times and it’s also true, I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky. It’s true that the president likes to use colorful language. Anyone who has met with him at any reasonable amount of time, knows this. Well I cannot remember the precise details, again, the White House has not allowed me to see any readouts of that call and the July 26th call did not strike me as significant at the time. Actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president’s concerns. However, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question. Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes. Mr. Giuliani conveyed to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and others that President Trump wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing to investigations of Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians and Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to us. We all understood that these prerequisites for the White House call and the White House meeting reflected President Trump’s desires and requirements.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Reflected President Trump’s desires and requirements. Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19th email. This email was sent. This email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who is Secretary Perry’s chief of staff at the time. Ms. Kenna, who is the acting… Pardon me. Who is the executive secretariat for Secretary Pompeo, Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Mr. Mulvaney’s senior advisor, Rob Blair. A lot of senior officials. A lot of senior officials.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Here is my exact quote from that email, “I talked to Zelensky just now. He is prepared to receive POTUS’s call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation, and will turn over every stone. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about a friendly and productive call. No details. Prior to Ukraine election on Sunday.” Chief of Staff Mulvaney responded, “I asked the NSC to set it up for tomorrow.” Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19th, days before the presidential call. As I communicated to the team, I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to run a fully transparent investigation and turn over every stone were necessary in his call with President Trump. On July 19th, in a WhatsApp message between Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and me, Ambassador Volker stated, “Had breakfast with Rudy this morning.” That’s Ambassador Volker and Rudy Giuliani. “Teeing up call with Yermak Monday.” That’s senior advisor, Andriy Yermak. “Must have helped. Most important is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation and address any specific personnel issues, if there are any.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	On August 10th, the next day, Mr. Yermak texted me, “Once we have a date,” which is a date for the White House meeting, “we will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of the US-Ukraine relationship, including among other things, Burisma and election meddling in investigations.” This is from Mr. Yermak to me.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	The following day, August 11th, and this is critical, I sent an email to Counselor Brechbuhl and Lisa Kenna. Lisa Kenna was frequently used as the pathway to Secretary Pompeo, as sometimes he preferred to receive his emails through her. She would print them out and put them in front of him. With the subject “Ukraine.” I wrote, “Mike,” referring to Mike Pompeo, “Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Zelensky to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough,” the boss being the President, “to authorize an invitation. Zelensky plans to have a big presser,” press conference, ” on the openness subject, including specifics next week.” All of which referred to the 2016 and the Burisma.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Ms. Kenna replied, “Gordon, I’ll pass to the Secretary. Thank you.” Again, everyone was in the loop.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Curiously, and this was very interesting to me. On August 26th, shortly before his visit to Kiev, Ambassador Bolton’s office requested Mr. Giuliani’s contact information from me. I send Ambassador Bolton the information directly. They requested Mr. Giuliani’s contact information on August 26th. I was first informed that the White House was withholding security aid to Ukraine during conversations with Ambassador Taylor on July 18th, 2019. However, as I testified before, I was never able to obtain a clear answer regarding the specific reason for the hold, whether it was bureaucratic in nature, which often happens, or reflected some other concern in the interagency process. I never participated in any of the subsequent DOD or DOS review meetings that others have described, so I can’t speak to what was discussed in those meetings.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Nonetheless, before the September 1st Warsaw meeting, the Ukrainians had become aware that security funds had yet to be disbursed. In the absence of credible explanation for the hold, I came to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	In preparation for the September 1 Warsaw meeting, I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to-face conversation between Trump and Zelensky would help to break the logjam, and this was when President Trump was still intending to travel to Warsaw. Specifically, on August 22nd, I emailed Secretary Pompeo directly, copying Secretariat Kenna. I wrote, and this is my email to Secretary Pompeo, “Should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place in mid-September, that Zelensky, he, Zelensky, should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to POTUS and the US. Hopefully, that will help break the logjam.” The Secretary replied, “Yes.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I followed up the next day asking to get 10 to 15 minutes on the Warsaw schedule for this. I said, “We’d like to know when it’s locked so that I can tell Zelensky and brief him.” Executive Secretary Kenna replied, “I will try for sure.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Moreover, given my concerns about the security aid, I have no reason to dispute that portion of Senator Johnson’s recent letter, in which he recalls conversations he and I had on August 30th. By the end of August, my belief was that if Ukraine did something to demonstrate a serious intention to fight corruption, and specifically addressing Burisma and the 2016, then the hold on military aid would be lifted.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	There was a September 1st meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. Unfortunately, President Trump’s attendance at the Warsaw meeting was canceled due to Hurricane Dorian. Vice President Pence attended instead. I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations. I recall mentioning that before the Zelensky meeting.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. The Vice President said that he would speak to President Trump about it.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Based on my previous communication with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. Yermak. It was a very, very brief pull-aside conversation that happened within a few seconds. I told Mr. Yermak that I believed that the resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	As my other State Department colleagues have testified, this security aid was critical to Ukraine’s defense and should not have been delayed. I expressed this view to many during this period. But my goal, at the time, was to do what was necessary to get the aid released, to break the logjam. I believed that the public statement we had been discussing for weeks was essential to advancing that goal. I really regret that the Ukrainians were placed in that predicament, but I do not regret doing what I could to try to break the logjam and to solve the problem.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I mentioned at the outset that throughout these events, we kept State Department leadership and others apprised of what we were doing. State Department was fully supportive of our engagement in Ukraine efforts, and was aware that a commitment to investigations was among the issues we were pursuing.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	To provide just two examples, on June 5th, the day after the US EU mission hosted our Independence Day, we did it a month early, Acting Assistant Secretary Phil Reeker sent an email to me, to Secretary Perry, and to others, forwarding some positive media coverage of President Zelensky’s attendance at our event. Mr. Reeker wrote, and I quote, “This headline underscores the importance and timeliness of Zelensky’s visit to Brussels, and the critical, perhaps historic, role of the dinner and engagement Gordon coordinated. Thank you for your participation and dedication to this effort.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Months later, on September 3rd, I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote, “Mike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Secretary Pompeo replied the next day on Wednesday, September 4th, quote, “All good. You’re doing great work. Keep banging away.” State Department leadership expressed total support for our efforts to engage the new Ukrainian administration.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Look, I’ve never doubted the strategic value of strengthening our alliance with Ukraine. At all times, our efforts were in good faith and fully transparent to those tasked with overseeing them. Our efforts were reported and approved. Not once do I recall encountering an objection.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their United States Ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the Committee’s questions. Thank you.  Adam Schiff & Devin Nunes Opening Statements
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, Mr. Chairman, when we left the Oval Office I believe on May 23rd, the request was very generic for an investigation of corruption in a very vanilla sense and dealing with some of the oligarch problems in Ukraine, which were longstanding problems. And then as time went on, more specific items got added to the menu, including the Burisma and 2016 election meddling specifically, the DNC server specifically. And over this, over this continuum, it became more and more difficult to secure the White House Meeting because more conditions were being placed on the White House meeting.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I was not privy to the call and I did not know that the condition of investigating the Bidens was a condition, correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It was not in any record I received.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes, I saw that in September, correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Not to me, to the entire group, Volker, Perry and myself, correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	2016, Burisma. The Biden’s did not come up.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Of course, today I know exactly what it means. I didn’t know at the time.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	The only part of Mr. Holmes recounting that I take exception with is I do not recall mentioning the Bidens, that did not enter my mind. It was Burisma and 2016 elections.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall saying Biden. I never recalled saying Biden.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, I can’t testify as to what Mr. Holmes might or might not have heard through the phone. I don’t know how he heard the conversation.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Vaguely, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Right, because we had been hearing about it from Rudy and we presumed Rudy was getting it from the President, so it seemed like a logical conclusion.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, he made that clear in the May 23rd meeting that he was not particularly fond of Ukraine and we had a lot of heavy lifting to do to get him to engage.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I believe they did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	2016 and Burisma.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I was talking logjam generically because nothing was moving.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Not that I recall.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I was in a briefing with several people and I just spoke up and I said, “It appears that everything is stalled until this statement gets made.” Something, words to that effect, and that’s what I believe to be the case based on the work that the three of us had been doing, Volcker, Perry and myself and the Vice President nodded like he heard what I said and that was pretty much it, as I recall.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I didn’t know what they were going to raise, but they in fact did raise it, Mr. Chairman.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, but I didn’t know what they were going to raise. I didn’t get a pre-brief from the Ukrainians.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	They were concerned, obviously.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s fair.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, I don’t have a readout of that meeting, so I can’t remember anything else.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, much has been made of that meeting and it really wasn’t a meeting. What happened was everyone got up after the bilateral meeting between President Zelensky and Vice President Pence and people do what they normally do. They get up, they mill around, they shake hands. And I don’t know if I came over to Yermak or he came over to me, but he said, “What’s going on here?” And I said, “I don’t know. It might all be tied together now, I have no idea.” I was presuming that it was, but it was a very short conversation.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, Mr. Yermak was already working on those investigation or on the statement about the investigations.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I likely did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, that email was not artfully written. I’m the first to admit what I was trying to convey to Ambassador Taylor after his frantic emails to me and to others about the security assistance, which by the way, I agreed with him. I thought it was a very bad idea to hold that money. I finally called the President, I believe it was on the 9th of September. I can’t find the records and they won’t provide them to me. But I believe I just asked him an open ended question. Mr. Chairman, “What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories and this and that. What do you want?” And it was a very short, abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood and he just said, “I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.” Something to that effect.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	So I typed out a text to Ambassador Taylor and my reason for telling him this was not to defend what the President was saying, not to opine on whether the President was being truthful or untruthful but simply to relay, “I’ve gone as far as I can go. This is the final word that I heard from the President of the United States. If you’re still concerned, you Ambassador Taylor are still concerned, please get ahold of the Secretary, maybe he can help.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I’m confused, Mr. Chairman, which conversations with Mr. Morrison and Mr. Taylor?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, I think it’s tied to my text, Mr. Chairman, because in my text I think I said something to the effect that he wants Zelensky to do what he ran on I believe his transparency, et cetera, et cetera, which was my clumsy way of saying he wanted these announcements to be made.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	All I can say is that I expressed what I told or what the President told me in that text. And if I had relayed anything other than what was in that text, I don’t recall.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Could you kindly repeat what they wrote?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’d be great.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Okay.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Absolutely.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Presumably.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	A working meeting, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I can’t characterize why he wanted them, all I can tell you is this is what we heard from Mr. Giuliani.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He had to announce the investigations, he didn’t actually have to do them as I understood it.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t want to characterize whether they are of value, not value. Again, through Mr. Giuliani, we were led to believe that that’s what he wanted.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Right. When the President says, “Talk to my personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani,” we followed his direction.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	As expressed through Rudy Giuliani, correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That was my presumption, my personal presumption based on the facts at the time, nothing was moving.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did not, I don’t recall saying the logjam over aid, I recall saying the logjam, I don’t know-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I meant that whatever was holding up the meeting, whatever was holding up our deal with Ukraine, I was trying to break. Again, I was presuming-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Okay.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Absolutely.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That was my belief.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	In terms of refreshing my recollection.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think you asked your question backwards. Are you saying people that take notes, it’s helpful to have those documents or people that don’t take notes, it’s helpful to have those documents?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I’m not a note taker, never have been.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Some, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Certain documents, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Documents that I didn’t have immediate access to.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	You have to ask my counsel, he was dealing with them.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, what triggered my memory was someone’s reference to ASAP Rocky, which was I believe the primary purpose of the phone call.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think I took the whole team out to lunch after the meeting, yeah.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, trying to reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit. But if someone said I had a meeting and I went to the meeting, then I’m not going to dispute that.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I have no control over who goes into a meeting in Ukraine, that was the Ukrainians that didn’t let them in.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, it was an open line.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, I have a unclassified conversations all the time from landlines that are unsecured and cell phones. If the topic is not classified and it’s up to the President to decide what’s classified and what’s not classified. And we were having … he was aware that it was an open line as well.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I mean it seems a little strange I would hold my phone here. I probably had my phone close to my ear and he claims to have overheard part of the conversation and I’m not going to dispute what he did or didn’t hear.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four letter words. In this case, three letters.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I probably said something to that effect because I remember the meeting, President Zelensky was very, solicitous is not a good word. He was just very willing to work with the United States and was being very amicable. And so putting it in Trump speak by saying “he loves your ass, he’ll do whatever you want,” meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s fair.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	One of its most, absolutely.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I do now know that, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It could have been words to that effect. I don’t remember my exact response.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I won’t dispute it, but again, I don’t recall.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, I don’t recall my exact words, but clearly the President beginning on May 23rd when we met with him in the Oval Office was not a big fan.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Apparently so.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t think I would have said that. I would have honestly said that he was not a big fan of Ukraine and he wants the investigations that we had been talking about for quite some time to move forward. That’s what I would’ve said because that’s the fact.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t, I recall Burisma, not Biden.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I would have, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I now know it all, of course.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	If we wanted to get anything done with Ukraine, it was apparent to us we needed to talk to Rudy.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, they would have to announce that they were going to do it.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed. The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise was that they had to be announced in some form and that form kept changing.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Announced publicly.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, the way it was expressed to me was that the Ukrainians had a long history of committing to things privately and then never following through. So President Trump presumably, again communicated through Mr. Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians on record publicly that they were going to do these investigations. That’s the reason that was given to me.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I didn’t hear either way.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I believe I spoke to him before his call.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, I think I was flying to Ukraine and I spoke with him, if I recall correctly just before I got on the plane.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I had a occasional access when he chose to take my call. Sometimes he would, sometimes he wouldn’t.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	You know, I don’t remember Mr. Goldman, but it very well could have been.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, I honestly, honestly don’t remember, but seems logical to me.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, if he testified that he got that message from me, then I would concur with that.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, if he testified to that to refresh my own memory, then yes, it’s likely I would have received that from President Trump.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, it does.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It is.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	The announcement of the investigations, correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Many, many people.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I believe I found out through Ambassador Taylor that the aid had been held up around July 18th, is when I heard originally.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I never heard anyone advocate for holding the aid.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I believe there was some press reports, you know, presuming or who knows, but I think at that point it became sort of common knowledge that everything might be tied together.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t know if he brought it up specifically, but asked where the aid was I think was more … I think he sort of asked, again, very vague recollection because I don’t have a readout of the bilateral meeting, but why don’t I have my check, essentially?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I certainly didn’t, couldn’t give them one.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Pretty much.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yep.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t know exactly what I said to him. This was a briefing attended by many people and I was invited at the very last minute. I wasn’t scheduled to be there, but I think I spoke up at some point late in the meeting and said, “It looks like everything is being held up until these statements get made.” And that’s my personal belief.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, I don’t recall any exchange or where he asked me any questions. I think he, it was sort of a duly noted.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, he did not.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He did not.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I said I didn’t know exactly why, but this could be a reason.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	We had all been working on toward that end, yeah.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	As I said, I said it could have been involved, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, my conversation with Ambassador Taylor, my conversation with Senator Johnson were all my personal belief just based on, as you put it, two plus two equals four.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	President Trump never told me directly that the aid was conditioned on the meetings. The only thing we got directly from Giuliani was that the Burisma and 2016 elections were conditioned on the White House meeting. The aid was my own personal, guess based again on your analogy, two plus two equals four.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	My testimony as I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement of elections.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Never heard those words.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah. It goes back to my earlier comment that again, coming from the Giuliani source, because we didn’t discuss this specifically with president Trump, that they wanted whatever commitments Ukraine made to be made publicly so that they would be on the record and be held more accountable. Whatever those commitments were.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	When I referenced a mistake, what I recall was I thought that a statement made by the new Ukrainian prosecutor, that these investigations would be started up again or commenced, would be sufficient to satisfy Mr. Giuliani/ President Trump. As I recall, my mistake was, someone came back through Volcker otherwise and said, “No, it’s not going to do if the prosecutor makes these statements. The president wants to hear it from Zelensky directly.” That’s the mistake I think I made.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I’m not going to question or not question. I’m just telling you what I believe I was was referring to.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	“Guys, multiple convos with Zelensky POTUS. Let’s talk.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Absolutely.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, I don’t recall President Trump ever talking to me about any security assistance ever. What this tells me, refreshing my memory, is that by the 8th of September it was abundantly clear to everyone that there was a link and that we were discussing the chicken and egg issue of, should the Ukrainians go out on a ledge and make the statement that President Trump wanted them to make and then they still don’t get their White House visit and their aid, that would be really bad for our credibility. I think that’s what he was referring to.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	If I said I did, I did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did not get that from President Trump, but I was under the impression that absolutely it was contingent-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	By September 8th I was absolutely convinced it was.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t ever recall, because that would have changed my entire calculus. If President Trump had told me directly, “I’m not-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	From a timeframe standpoint, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Let me break that down. Mr Goldman. The text, as I said, about the no quid pro quo was my effort to respond to Ambassador Taylor’s concerns to go to President Trump. Apparently Ambassador Taylor had access to Secretary Pompeo, He did not have access to President Trump. So, I made the phone call. I said, what do you want? President Trump responded with what I put in the text and then I strongly encouraged Ambassador Taylor to take it up with the secretary, and he responded, “I agree,” when I said that.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	As far as the other part of your question, relating to whether or not the prosecutor could make the statement or Zelensky could make the statement, I don’t recall who told me, whether it was Volker, whether it was Giuliani or whether it was President Trump, “It’s got to be Zelensky, it can’t be the prosecutor.” But that’s what I relayed. Whoever I got that information from, I relayed that to, I believe, both Mr., Or, excuse me, Ambassador Taylor and to Mr. Morrison.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I believe that is correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Thank you.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	This is the May 23rd meeting?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I believe that’s what he was referring to, yes. Right, ranking member.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	A few text messages and a few phone calls. Right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t know about any drug deal.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I am. I am a proud part of the three Amigos.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I knew military aid was withheld beginning, I believe, on July 18th when Ambassador Taylor told both of us that that was the case.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I was not.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, I just read the readout when everyone else did-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I didn’t realize that aid was tied. The Burisma and 2016 piece was much earlier, ranking member.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I wasn’t aware of that, no.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did not know that.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Did not know that.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Good morning, Mr. Castor.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Personally, no.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t want to speculate what would be-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall anything like-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	My contact with Mr. Giuliani began, as I said, very late in the process after August 1st, when I was first introduced to him by a text from Ambassador Volker. So, we had already begun those discussions, I believe, with the Ukrainians prior to August 1st, so everything was being funneled through others, including Mr. Volker.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s our understanding, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, when the president says, “Talk to my personal attorney,” and then Mr. Giuliani, as his personal attorney, makes certain requests or demands, we assume it’s coming from the president. I’m not testifying that I heard the president tell Mr. Giuliani to tell us. So, if that’s your question …
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Our conclusion and the conclusion of the three of us was that if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing would move forward on Ukraine.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Volker, Perry and others.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes, he is.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I do, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He is pretty, pretty smart.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I would.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did not.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I was busy getting ready for you.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He was the special envoy.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Not that I recall.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah. What refreshed my recollection was when he mentioned ASAP Rocky. Then all of a sudden it came back to me.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, the whole thing sort of came back to me after he mentioned ASAP Rocky.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I may have even spoken to him on September 6th but again, I just don’t have all the records. I wish I could get them. Then I could answer your questions very easily.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He seemed very cranky to me.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, words to the effect. I decided to ask the President the question in an open ended fashion because there were so many different scenarios floating around as to what was going on with Ukraine. So rather than ask the President nine different questions, is it this? Is it this? Is it that? I just said, what do you want from Ukraine? I may have even used a four letter word and he said, “I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I just want Zelensky to do the right thing, to do what he ran on” or words to that effect. And that gave me the impetus to respond to Ambassador Taylor with the texts that I sent. As I said to Mr. Goldman, it was not an artfully written text. I should’ve been more specific, put it in quotes, something like that. But basically I wanted Mr. Taylor, Ambassador Taylor to pick up the ball and take it from there. I had gone as far as I could go.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	You know what? I’m not going to characterize whether I believed or didn’t believe. I was just trying to convey what he said on the phone.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s what I understand. Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It was a presumption.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, I want to say that it goes back to Mr. Goldman’s point or Chairman Schiff’s two plus two equaled four in my mind at that point.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Other than the aid wasn’t being released and we weren’t getting anywhere with the Ukrainians.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, I sent that email to Secretary Pompeo to set up a potential meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky in Warsaw. And when I referred to the log jam, I referred to the logjam in a very inclusive way. Everything was jammed up at that point. And secretary Pompeo essentially gave me the green light to brief President Zelensky about making those announcements.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Do you have the page there?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	August 22nd.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	This was a proposed briefing that I was going to give President Zelensky and I was going to call President Zelensky and ask him to say what is in this email. And I was asking essentially President Pompeo’s permission to do that, which he said yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Joe Biden did not come up.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct. Well, the statement as I recall, would have mentioned the 2016 election slash DNC server and Burisma.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It would not have mentioned the Bidens.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, we just talked in generic terms about quote investigating Burisma.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I had never heard Vice President Biden come up until very late in the game.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall the exact date. But when it all sort of came together, maybe after the transcript of the July 25th call, I don’t know. I don’t know the exact date when I made the connection.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Apparently a lot of people did not make the connection.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, I had my meeting with Senator Johnson where again, I had made the presumption that I had made to both Mr. Urmach and the email I had sent to secretary Pompeo and we were sort of ruminating about what was going on. Senator Johnson I believe said, “I’m going to call President Trump, you know, and find out.” And then he obviously had that phone call. I wasn’t involved in that phone call.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, no reason to disbelieve Senator Johnson.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I haven’t had that many communications with the President. And in fact a bunch of the call records that I have had access to just the short period of time on the call indicates I never got through. In other words, I was put on hold for one or two minutes and the call never connected. So I really can’t give you an accurate count of how many conversations plus Mr. Caster, I’ve had a lot of conversations with the President about completely unrelated matters that have nothing to do with Ukraine.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall any material conversations today as I’m sitting here.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah. My memory about the conversations with Rudy Giuliani, whether they were direct, whether they were conference calls with Ambassador Volker or Secretary Perry is really vague without seeing the, you know, the call logs.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Maybe Brian McCormack, the chief of staff for Secretary Perry who was involved in and out as well.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I believe that’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	[crosstalk 01:17:29] It sounds like it. Yeah.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I didn’t know because every time I asked about the hold, I was never given a straight answer as to why it had been put in place to begin with.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Oh, that’s very vague, I don’t know if the Politico article triggered it. I don’t know if they were told by Mr. Giuliani, it would be pure, you know, guesswork on my part. Speculation. I don’t know.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah. Again, I think I testified that I was not clear on the exact dates of when these things, when the light went on. There were a lot of conversations going on with the Ukrainians by a lot of people. So I don’t know who communicated what to them.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I’m aware that that’s been his position on aid and other matters. Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That I’m definitely aware of.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes, that’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I presumed it, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, again, I’m not going to dispute Ambassador Volker’s recollection, particularly if he had notes. I know that the desire to have the 2016 election DNC server and Burisma were already being discussed by then. Again, I had no direct contact with Mr. Giuliani on July 10th but through Ambassador Volker and I probably mentioned that this needs to happen in order to move the process forward. That seemed to be the conventional wisdom at the time. I don’t recall any abrupt ending of the meeting or people storming out or anything like that. That would have been very memorable if someone had stormed out of a meeting based on something I said.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Never.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I was shocked.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, Ambassador Bolton or his assistant indicated that he was out of time, that he needed, he had another meeting to attend and we all walked out of the White House. Everyone was smiling, everyone was happy, and we took a picture on the lawn on a nice sunny day.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think Secretary Perry asked to use the ward room to continue the conversation and the real subject that was under debate, and it wasn’t a angry debate, it was a debate, is should the call from President Trump to President Zelensky be made prior to the parliamentary elections in Ukraine or after the parliamentary elections? And there was good reason for both. We felt Ambassador Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I thought it would help Presidents Zelensky to have President Trump speak to him prior to the parliamentary elections because it would give President Zelensky more credibility and ultimately he would do better with his people in the parliamentary elections. Others I believe, pushed back and said, no, it’s not appropriate to do it before. It should be done after. And ultimately it was done after.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Not that I remember, no.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Just the generic investigations.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Very late. Again, I don’t, I can’t recall the exact date the light bulb went on. It could have been as late as once the transcript was out, but it was always Burisma to me and I didn’t know about the connection between Burisma and Biden.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Ukrainians to investigate US persons?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Not to my knowledge.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t believe so.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s what he expressed to us. Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	When we had the conversation, I did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It was a generic, as I think I testified to Chairman Schiff, it was a generic corruption, oligarchs, just bad stuff going on in Ukraine.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t know if they were mentioned specifically. It might’ve been NAFTA gas because we were working on another issue with NAFTA gas. So that might’ve been one of them.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Probably.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I didn’t understand what she was talking about.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, when the President appointed me as the US ambassador of the European Union, Ukraine was part of my portfolio. What made my assignment larger than just being part of my portfolio were the unique circumstances where there was no current sitting ambassador in Ukraine and there was a new President in Ukraine. The discussions that we had, the three amigos, Perry, Volker and I was that Ukraine needed extraordinary as high level support as it could get from the United States during this period, which we cleared with both Ambassador Bolton and with Chief Of Staff Mulvaney to continue working on it. So by extension, yes. If the national security advisor and the chief of staff approve your remit, it really is coming from the President.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I was spinning about something else I think in the interview in Kiev.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, in fact the opposite. When he came to post, I think I know I called him or he called me, I think he spoke with Secretary Perry and Ambassador Volker separately and in the course of the first few weeks he was highly appreciative that a new ambassador coming to post like himself was getting the kind of support he was getting from all three of us. Having a cabinet member, a special envoy, and a fellow ambassador all helping to raise the profile of Ukraine. He was highly appreciative and highly complimentary.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct. I think there are a number of texts, some of which I have and some of which I don’t, where he is reaching out constantly to me and to the others for advice and help.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think Taylor started in late June or early July was when he first took post and I think we began communicating fairly shortly thereafter.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	What do you mean by what was going on?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Not in the early stages. As time went on, his emails began to be a little more pointed and frantic and that’s when we had very little visibility as to what was going on either. I think it had to do more with the aid and as to why the aid was suspended.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t really know because he responded when I said, you know, get ahold of the secretary, he said, I agree. And I never knew whether he reached out to the secretary or not. That was sort of the end of that.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I say that to everybody when something becomes more substantive than just a few lines of text, I say let’s talk.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall. I mean, I don’t recall whether we spoke right after that, whether he called the secretary. Basically, Mr. Caster wanted to get the notion across that I’ve gone as far as I can go with this, you to pick up the, you’re the ambassador. You need to pick up the ball and run with it at this point.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I’m not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel. When you’re talking to the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Chief of Staff of the White House, the Secretary of Energy. I don’t know how that’s irregular. If a bunch of folks that are not in that channel are aggrieved for some reason for not being included, I don’t know how they can consider us to be the irregular channel and they to be the regular channel when it’s the leadership that makes the decisions.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, they were never raised.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	They were never raised. No one’s said back off of Ukraine, this is dangerous. You’re doing something that’s untoward. We have concerns. There was a bad phone call on July 25th, there’s talk about a drug cocktail or something. No one ever said that to me by phone, by text, by email. I don’t remember anybody sounding any alarm bell because of course had someone mentioned it, I would have sat up and taken notice.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think once that Politico article broke, it started making the rounds that, you know, if you can’t get a White House meeting without the statement, what makes you think you’re going to get a $400 million check? Again that was my presumption.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Not all of them. And there are lots of notes, records, readouts of calls, can’t get to them.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t take notes, but there are a lot of others out there.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Is that all?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Right. I mean it’s situational things that sort of trigger memory, especially when I’m, you know, I’m dealing with the European Union, I’m dealing with the 28 member countries. I’m dealing with other countries that are not in the European Union that are part of my mandate. I’m dealing with the White House leadership. There’s a lot of stuff to juggle. And as I said in my opening statement, a phone call for me with the President of the United States or the President of fill in the blank country, while people who get a call like that, maybe once in a lifetime, a call like that might be very memorable. They might remember every single thing about it. I’m doing that all day long and I’m not saying it in a way of being braggadocio or anything like that, but it’s part of my routine day. So all of these calls, these meetings with very important people tend to sort of blend together until I have someone that can show me what we discussed, what the subject was, then all of a sudden it comes back.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, what I’m trying to do today is to use the limited information I have to be as forthcoming as possible with you and the rest of the committee. And as these recollections had been refreshed by-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	And as these recollections had been refreshed by subsequent testimony by some texts and emails that I’ve now had access to, I think I filled in a lot of blanks.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I’ve been very clear as to when I was presuming and I was presuming on the aid, on the other things, Mr. Caster, I did have some texts that I read from. So when it comes to those, I’ll rely on those texts because I don’t have any reason to believe that those texts were falsely sent or that there’s some subterfuge there. They are what they are. They say what they say.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Thank you.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, my role Mr. Chairman was just to get the meeting.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I didn’t and I wasn’t paying attention to what Mr. Giuliani was seeing on TV, we were talking to him directly.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It does
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah. A lot of people were aware of it and-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t think I saw it live. I saw later, yeah.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well again, I didn’t know that the aid was conclusively tied. I was presuming he was in a position to say yes it was or no it wasn’t because-
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He said yes it was.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	To set up the call between President Trump and President Zelensky, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It looks like it’s… Is it from me? I don’t know.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	It’s from me to to the group.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	People mentioned on the email? Blair, Kenna, McCormack, Mulvaney, Perry, Pompeo.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I believe he’s a deputy chief of staff or a advisor to the chief of staff.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He was was the chief of staff for Secretary Perry.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He is prepared to receive POTUS’ call will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation. We’ll turn over every stone. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so he can put out some media about a friendly and productive call. No details prior to Ukraine election on Sunday.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I’m referring to the Burisma and the 2016 / DNC server investigations.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t know. If I have them, I would show them. I don’t know.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, there was a chain, and I don’t know if it’s part of this email or a subsequent email where I believe Ambassador Bolton pushed back and said he did not want a call to President Zelensky made by President Trump until after the parliamentary elections.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t think he is, no.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I wasn’t aware of that.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did read that in the newspaper, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think I’m aware of that, yeah.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I am aware of that as well.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think they would.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t know what Mr. Mulvaney heard or didn’t hear. I think there’s been a huge amount of exaggeration over my contact with Mr. Mulvaney. It was actually quite limited.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Right, because I think Mr. Mulvaney was in the May 23rd briefing with President Trump. I don’t remember because there were people sitting behind us that were coming and going when we were sitting in front of President Trump’s desk.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t have any reason to agree or dispute. I just don’t remember.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, I trust that they related to the NSC legal advisor. I don’t know whether I said it and I don’t know which conversation… Again, I’ve had very, very limited conversations with Mr. Mulvaney.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Which email again?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes. I got it.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think that part was verbal and then there were a lot of communications going around back and forth with the Ukrainians and that’s when someone, and I don’t remember who, came up with the idea of a draft statement, so there would be no misunderstanding about what in fact the Ukrainians would say and would be willing to say that we could rely on and negotiate something on a piece of paper.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	There was initially apparently a condition, but that condition was obviously dropped because the phone call took place and there was no such statement made. The phone call took place as you said on the 25th of July.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well the Ukrainians never made their public statement prior to the phone call on the 25th of July.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	In my email, I obviously had just spoken with him and he being Zelensky, and he said that he was prepared to receive the call and he would make those assurances to President Trump on that call. And then presumably that would then lead to the White House meeting.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes. With Volcker, with Perry, with Giuliani through Volcker and Perry.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s what it says.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s what we all understood.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, myself.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	And I think Taylor was involved in those initial discussions as well.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	The commitment to do the investigations.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall. I may have had a conversation with him or I may have heard it from someone else, but I don’t recall. Again, without all these records.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Hello? Good, my prop… Oh no, that’s Yermak. “How was your conversation?”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, I can see it on the screen, yeah.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Ukraine.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	“Mike,” and I’m referring to Secretary Pompeo, “Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Zelensky to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation. Zelensky plans to have a big presser on the openness subject, including specifics next week.”
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	The 2016 and the Burisma.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	President Trump.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	To the white house meeting.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes. If I could see it, that would be helpful. But yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think there were statements being passed back and forth between Volker, the Ukrainians, and others to try and negotiate acceptable language.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Still hasn’t occurred.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I know that now, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Mike, should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look them in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place mid September, Zelensky should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to POTUS and to the U.S. Hopefully that will break the log jam.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	The new prosecutor that was going to be working for President Zelensky. The old prosecutor, I believe his term was up or he was being let go, he was the Poroshenko prosecutor and Zelensky wanted to wait until his person was in place.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, the 2016 election and Burisma investigation.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I was not.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I mean, I can’t characterize his state of mind. He listened in on the phone call and he concluded what he concluded.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I became aware on the 18th of July.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, as I said to chairman Schiff, I meant inclusively anything that was holding up moving forward on the meeting and the Ukraine U.S. relationship.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	At that point, it was the statements about Burisma and the 2016 elections.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, the aid was being held up, obviously
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No idea.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I knew he was about to go to Ukraine. I didn’t know exactly when his trip was, but I thought it was kind of an odd request given that the White House can pretty much get anyone’s phone number they want.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	He heard what I said.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall any substantive response.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t remember ever mentioning the Bidens. I may have mentioned Burisma.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall him mentioning the investigations.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I think I referenced, I didn’t say that Ukraine had to do the investigations, I think I said that we heard from Mr. Giuliani that that was the case.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Correct.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, I didn’t hear from Mr. Giuliani about the aid. I heard about the Burisma in 2016
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That was the problem, Mr. Goldman. No one told me directly that the aid was tied to anything. I was presuming it was.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Do you have the email by any chance?
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Yeah, go ahead though with your question.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Again, if my email said I spoke with President Trump, presumably I did.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	That’s right.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Well, if they had texts or emails, I would if they had notes, I don’t know. Some people’s notes are great, some people’s aren’t. I don’t know.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Including my own.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t know if I got that from President Trump or I got it from Giuliani. That’s the part I’m not clear on.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No, if they have notes and they recall that, I don’t have any reason to dispute it. I just personally can’t remember where I got it from.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	No.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	At that point, yes.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I don’t recall it specifically, but I may have.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Okay.
2019-11-20	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	I didn’t say that they had to be announced on CNN. The Ukrainians said to me or to Ambassador Volker or both of us, that they had planned to do an interview anyway on CNN and they would use that occasion to mention these items.
2019-12-04	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes. Everyone was in the loop.
2019-12-09	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question. “Was there a quid pro quo?” As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.
2019-12-09	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting? The answer is yes. Everyone was in the loop.
2019-12-09	Gordon Sondland	W-Sondland	W-Sondland	But I also must acknowledge that this process has been challenging, and in many respects, less than fair. I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails, and many, many other State Department documents, and I was told I could not work with my EU staff to pull together the relevant files and information. These documents are not classified, and in fairness, should have been made available.
2019-12-04	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	To withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with the political campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.
2019-12-09	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The Russians are violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years. That rule of law, that order that kept the peace in Europe and allowed for prosperity as well as peace in Europe was violated by the Russians. It affects the world that we live in, that our children will grow up in and our grandchildren. This affects the kind of world that we want to see overall.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I’m appearing today at the Committee’s request to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the Committee’s inquiry. I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the Committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings. My sole purpose is to provide facts as I know them about the incidents in question as well as my views about the strategic importance of Ukraine to the United States.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	By way of background, it has been a privilege for me to serve our country and the American people for more than 50 years. Starting as a cadet at West Point is, you have mentioned Mr. Chairman, then as an infantry officer for six years, including with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, then at the Department of Energy, then as a member of a senate staff, then at NATO, then with the State Department here and abroad in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem, and Ukraine. I retired from the State Department in 2009 to join the United States Institute of Peace. I’m neither a career member of the Foreign Service nor of the civil service. I am nonpartisan and have been appointed to my positions by every president from President Reagan to President Trump.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Let me summarize my main points. First, Ukraine is a strategic partner of the United States, important for the security of our country as well as Europe. Ukraine is on the frontline in the conflict with the newly aggressive Russia. Second, even as we sit here today, the Russians are attacking Ukrainian soldiers in their own country and have been for the last four years. I saw this on the frontline last week. The day I was there, a Ukrainian soldier was killed, and four were wounded. Third, the security assistance we provide is crucial to Ukraine’s defense and to the protection of the soldiers I met on the frontline last week. It demonstrates to Ukrainians and Russians that we are Ukraine’s reliable strategic partner. It is clearly in our national interest to deter further Russian aggression.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Finally, as the Committee is aware, I wrote that withholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign in the United States would be crazy. I believe that then, and I believe it now. Let me tell you why. On May 28th of this year, I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who asked me to rejoin the State Department and return to Kyiv to lead our embassy in Ukraine. It was and is a critical time for US-Ukraine relations. I had served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009 having been nominated by George W. Bush, and in the intervening 10 years, had stayed engaged with Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Across the responsibilities I have had in public service, Ukraine is the highlight, and so Secretary Pompeo’s offer to return as chief of mission was compelling. Since I left Ukraine in 2009, the country had continued to turn towards the west, but in 2013, Vladimir Putin was so threatened by the prospect of Ukraine joining the European Union that he tried to bribe the Ukrainian president. This triggered mass protest in the winter of 2013 that drove that president to flee to Russia in February of 2014, but not before his forces killed a hundred Ukrainian protesters in the Central Kyiv.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Days later, Mr. Putin invaded Crimea, holding a sham referendum at the point of Russian army rifles. The Russians absurdly claim that 97% voted to join Russia. In early April, Putin sent his army and security forces into South Eastern Ukraine to generate illegal armed formations and puppet governments and what we know is Donbass. You can see this on the map in right-hand portion, in the eastern portion of the country. 14,000 Ukrainians have died in the war in Donbass, and more die each week.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	In July of 2014 these Russian-led forces in Donbass shut down a civilian airliner en route from Amsterdam to Malaysia, killing all 298 people on board. We, the Europeans, and most of the west imposed economic sanctions and kicked the Russians out of the G8. Beginning in 2014, we and NATO began to provide military assistance to Ukraine’s armed forces in the form of training, advice, military equipment, and weapons. It is this security assistance that is at the heart of the controversy that we are discussing today. The pro-Russian president who was run out of Kyiv in 2014 had let the Russian armed forces deteriorate to the point of ruin. In response to the Russian invasion, the new Ukrainian authorities, with an amazing outpouring of support from regular Ukrainian people, rebuilt the army nearly from scratch, spending more than 5% of Ukrainian GDP on defense since the war started. The whole Ukrainian nation fiercely responded to the Russian attack. The nation united like never before. A ragtag army developed into a strong fighting force, and the United States played a vital role.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Since 2014, you and Congress have provided over $1.6 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The security assistance provides small unit training at an army base near Lviv in the western of the country. It provides ambulances, night vision devices, communications equipment, counter battery radar, navy ships, and finally, weapons. The security systems demonstrates our commitment to resist aggression and defend freedom.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	During the 2014 to 2016 period, I was serving outside of government and joined two other former ambassadors to Ukraine and urging the Obama administration officials at the State Department, Defense Department, and other agencies to provide lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine in order to deter further Russian aggression. I also supported much stronger sanctions on Russia. I was pleased when the Trump administration provided Javelin anti-tank missiles and enacted stronger sanctions. All to say, I cared about Ukraine’s future and the important US interests there, so when Secretary Pompeo asked me to go back to Kyiv, I wanted to say yes, but it was not an easy decision. The former Ambassador Masha Yovanovitch has been treated poorly, caught in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and in Washington. I feared that those problems were still present.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I consulted both my wife and a respected former senior Republican official who has been a mentor. I will tell you that my wife in no uncertain terms strongly opposed to the idea. The mentor counseled, “If your country ask you to do something, you do it if you can be effective.” I could be effective only if the US policy of strong support for Ukraine, strong diplomatic support along with robust security, economic, and technical assistance were to continue, and if I had the backing of the secretary of state to implement that policy, and I worried about what I had heard concerning the role of Rudy Giuliani, who had made several controversial statements about Ukraine and US policy toward the country. During my meeting with Secretary Pompeo on May 28, I made clear to him and the others present that if US policy toward Ukraine changed, he would not want me posted there, and I could not stay. He assured me that the policy of strong support for Ukraine would continue and that he would support me in defending that policy. With that understanding, I agreed to go back to Kyiv. Because I was appointed by the Secretary but not reconfirmed by the Senate, my official position was chargé d’affaires ad interim. In effect, I was the acting ambassador to Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I returned to Kyiv on June 17th, carrying the original copy of a letter President Trump signed the day after I met with the Secretary. In that letter, President Trump congratulated President Zelensky on his election victory and invited him to a meeting in the Oval Office. But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	First, the encouraging: President Zelensky was reforming Ukraine in a hurry. He appointed reformist ministers and supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took quick executive action, including opening Ukraine’s High Anti-Corruption Court. With a new parliamentary majority stemming from snap elections, President Zelensky changed the Ukrainian Constitution to remove absolute immunity from Rada deputies, the source of raw corruption for two decades. The excitement in Kyiv was palpable. This time could be different, a new Ukraine finally breaking from its corrupt, post-Soviet past.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yet, I found a confusing and unusual arrangement for making US policy toward Ukraine. There appeared to be two channels of US policy-making and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the acting ambassador, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes, including the bulk of the US effort to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion and to help it defeat corruption. My colleague, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and our colleagues at the National Security Council were my main points of contact in Washington in this regular channel. This channel is formally responsible for formulating and overseeing the implementation of US foreign policy with respect to Ukraine, a policy that has consistently enjoyed strong, bipartisan support, both in Congress and in all administrations since Ukraine’s independence from Russia in 1991.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	At the same time, however, I encountered an irregular, informal channel of US policy-making with respect to Ukraine, unaccountable to Congress, a channel that included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and, as I subsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani. I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland including me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department channels. The irregular channel began when Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron Johnson briefed President Trump on May 23 upon their return from President Zelensky’s inauguration. The delegation was as enthusiastic as I would soon become about the new Ukrainian president and urged President Trump to meet with him early on to cement the US-Ukraine relationship. But from what I understood from the participants, President Trump did not share their enthusiasm for a meeting with President Zelensky.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	When I arrived in Kyiv, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy appeared to serve the same goal: a strong US-Ukraine partnership. But it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives. As this occurred, I became increasingly concerned. In late June, both channels were trying to facilitate a visit by President Zelensky to the White House for a meeting with President Trump, which President Trump had promised in his congratulatory letter of May 29. The Ukrainians were clearly eager for the meeting to happen.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	But during my subsequent communications with Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, they relayed to me that the President wanted to hear from Zelensky before scheduling the meeting in the Oval Office. It was not clear to me what this meant. On June 27, Ambassador Sondland told me during a phone conversation that President Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that he, President Zelensky, was not standing in the way of investigations.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	"I sensed something odd when Ambassador Sondland told me on June 28 that he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants in a call planned with President Zelensky later that day. Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry, and I were on this call, dialing in from different locations; however, Ambassador Sondland said that he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring as they added President Zelensky to the call. Also, before President Zelensky joined the call, Ambassador Volker separately told the US participants that he, Ambassador Volker, planned to be explicit with President Zelensky in a one-on-one meeting in Toronto on July 2. In that meeting, Ambassador Volker planned to make clear-"
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	In that meeting, Ambassador Volker planned to make clear what President Zelensky should do, to get the White House meeting. I did not understand what this meant, but Ambassador Volker said he would relay that President Trump wanted to see rule of law, transparency, but also specifically, cooperation on investigations, to get to the bottom of things. Once President Zelensky joined the call, the conversation was focused on energy policy, and the war in Donbass. President Zelensky also said he looked forward to the White House visit President Trump had offered in his May 29th letter.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	By mid-July, it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma, and alleged Ukrainian interference and the 2016 U.S. elections. It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani. In a regular NSC secure video conference call on July 18th, I heard a staff person from the Office of Management and Budgets say that there was a hold on security assistance to Ukraine, but could not say why. Toward the end of an otherwise normal meeting, a voice on the call… The person was off screen… said that she was from OMB, and her boss had instructed her not to approve any additional spending on security assistance for Ukraine until further notice. I, and others, sat in astonishment. Ukrainians were fighting Russians, and counted on not only the training and weapons, but also the assurance of U.S. support. All that the OMB staff person said was that the directive had come from the president, to the chief of staff, to OMB. In an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened. The regular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	There followed a series of NSC-led inter-agency meetings, starting at the staff level, and quickly reaching the level of cabinet secretaries. At every meeting, the unanimous conclusion was that the security assistance should be resumed, the hold lifted. At one point, the Defense Department was asked to perform an analysis of the effectiveness of the assistance. Within a day, the Defense Department came back with a determination that the assistance was effective, and should be resumed. My understanding was that the secretaries of defense and state, the CIA director, and the national security advisor sought a joint meeting with the president to convince him to release the hold, but such a meeting was hard to schedule, and the hold lasted well into September.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	On July 9th, in a phone call with then-Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs Fiona Hill, and Director of European Affairs, Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vindman at the NSC, they tried to assure me that they were not aware of any official change in U.S. policy towards Ukraine, OMB’s announcement notwithstanding. They did confirm that the hold on security assistance for Ukraine came from Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who maintained a skeptical view of Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	In the same July 19th phone call, they gave me an account of a July 10th meeting with Ukrainian and American officials at the White House. They told me that partway through the meeting, Ambassador Sondland had connected investigations with an Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky, which so irritated then-national security advisor John Bolton, that he abruptly ended the meeting, telling Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman that they should have nothing to do with domestic politics. He also directed Dr. Hill to, “Brief the lawyers.” Dr. Hill said that Ambassador Bolton referred to this deal as, “This is a drug deal,” after the July 10th meeting. Ambassador Bolton opposed a call between President Zelensky and President Trump, out of concern that it would be a disaster.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Needless to say, the Ukrainians in the meetings were confused. Ambassador Bolton and the regular Ukraine policy decision making channel wanted to talk about security, energy, and reform. Ambassador Sondland, a participate in the irregular channel, wanted to talk about the connection between a White House meeting and Ukrainian investigations.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Also during our July 190th call, Dr. Hill informed me that Ambassador Volker had met with Mr. Giuliani to discuss Ukraine. This caught me by surprise. The next day I asked Ambassador Volker about that meeting, but received no response. I began to sense that these two separate decision making channels, the regular and the irregular, were separate and at odds.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Later that day, I received text messages on a three-way WhatsApp text conversation with Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, a record of which was provided by Ambassador Volker. Ambassador Sondland said that a call between President Trump and President Zelensky would take place soon. Ambassador Volker said that what was most important is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation, and address any specific personnel issues, if there are any.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	On the next day, July 20th, I had a phone conversation with Ambassador Sondland, while he was on a train from Paris to London. Ambassador Sondland told me that he had recommended to President Zelensky that he use the phrase, “I will leave no stone unturned with regard to investigations,” when President Zelensky spoke with President Trump.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Also on July 20th, I had a phone conversation with Alexander [inaudible 00:19:54], President Zelensky’s National Security Advisor, who emphasized that President Zelensky did not want to be used as an instrument in a U.S. reelection campaign. The next day, I texted both Ambassadors Volker and Sondland about President Zelensky’s concern.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	On July 25th, President Trump and President Zelensky had the long-awaited phone conversation. Even though I was acting ambassador, and was scheduled to meet with President Zelensky along with Ambassador Volker the following day, I received no readout of the call from the White House. The Ukrainian government issued a short, cryptic summary.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	During a previously planned July 26th meeting, President Zelensky told Ambassador Volker and me that he was happy with the call, but did not elaborate. President Zelensky then asked about the face to face meeting in the Oval Office, as promised in the May 29th letter from President Trump. We could give him no firm answer.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	After our meeting with President Zelensky, Ambassador Volker and I traveled to the front line in northern Donbass to receive a briefing from the commander of forces on the line of contact. Arriving for the briefing in the military headquarters, the commander thanked us for the security assistance, but I was aware that this assistance was on hold, which made me uncomfortable. Ambassador Volker and I could see the armed and hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge, across the line of contact. Russian-led forces continued to kill Ukrainians in the war, one or two a week. More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Although I spent the morning of July 26th with President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials, the first summary of the July 25th Trump/Zelensky call that I heard from anybody inside the U.S. government was during a phone call I had with Tim Morrison, Dr. Hill’s recent replacement at the NSC, on July 28th. Mr. Morrison told me that the call could have been better, and that President Trump had suggested that President Zelensky or his staff meet with Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. I did not see any official readout of the call until it was publicly released on September 25th.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	By August, I was becoming more concerned. On August 16th I exchanged text messages with Ambassador Volker, in which I learned that Andriy Yermak, a senior advisor to President Zelensky, had asked that the United States submit an official request for an investigation into Burisma’s alleged violations of Ukrainian law, if that is what the United States desired. A formal U.S. request to the Ukrainians to conduct an investigation based on violations of their own law struck me as improper, and I recommended to Ambassador Volker that we stay clear. To find out the legal aspects of the question, however, I gave him the name of a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, whom I thought would be the proper point of contact for seeking a U.S. request for a foreign investigation.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	By mid-August, because the security assistance had been held for over a month, for no reason that I could discern, I was beginning to fear that the longstanding U.S. policy of support for Ukraine was shifting. I called State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl to discuss this on August 21st. He said he was not aware of a change in policy, but would check on the status of the security assistance.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	My concern deepened the next day, on August 22nd, during a phone conversation with Mr. Morrison. I asked him if there had been a change in policy of strong support for Ukraine, to which he responded, “It remains to be seen.” He also told me during this call that, “The president doesn’t want to provide any assistance at all.” That was extremely troubling to me, as I had told Secretary Pompeo in May if the policy of strong support for Ukraine were to change, I would have to resign. Based on my call with Mr. Morrison, I was preparing to do so.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Just days later, on August 27th, Ambassador Bolton arrived in Kiev, and met with President Zelensky. During their meeting, security assistance was not discussed. As far as I knew, the Ukrainians were not aware of the hold until August 29th. I, on the other hand, was all too aware of, and still troubled by the hold. Near the end of Ambassador Bolton’s visit, I asked to meet him privately, during which I expressed to him my serious concern about the withholding of military assistance to Ukraine while the Ukrainians were defending their country from Russian aggression. Ambassador Bolton recommended that I send a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo directly, relaying my concerns.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I wrote and transmitted such a cable on August 29th, describing the folly I saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east, and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian government. “The Russians,” as I said in my deposition, “would love to see the humiliation of President Zelensky at the hands of the Americans.” I told the secretary that I could not and would not defend such a policy. Although I received no specific response, I heard that soon thereafter, the secretary carried the cable with him to a meeting at the White House focused on security assistance to Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The same day that I sent my cable to the secretary, Mr. Yermak contacted me very concerned, asking about the withheld security assistance. The hold that the White House had placed on assistance had just been made public that day, in a political story. At that point, I was embarrassed that I could give him no explanation for why it was withheld. It had still not occurred to me that the hold on security assistance could be related to the investigations. That, however, would change.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	On September 1st, just three days after my cable to Secretary Pompeo, President Zelensky met Vice President Pence at a bilateral meeting in Warsaw. President Trump had planned to travel to Warsaw, but at the last minute had canceled because of Hurricane Dorian. Just hours before the Pence/Zelensky meeting, I contacted Mr. [inaudible 00:26:22], to let him know that the delay of U.S. assistance was an all or nothing proposition, in the sense that if the White House did not lift the hold prior to the end of the fiscal year, September 30th, the funds would expire, and Ukraine would receive nothing. I was hopeful that at the bilateral meeting, or shortly thereafter, the White House would lift the hold, but this was not to be.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	On the evening of September 1st, I received a readout of the Pence/Zelensky meeting over the phone from Mr. Morrison, during which he told me that President Zelensky had opened the meeting by immediately asking the vice president about the security cooperation. The vice president did not respond substantively, but said that he would talk to President Trump that night. The vice president did say that President Trump wanted the Europeans to do more to support Ukraine, and that he wanted the Ukrainians to do more to fight corruption.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	During the same phone call with Mr. Morrison, he described a conversation Ambassador Sondland had with Mr. Yermak in Warsaw. Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation. I was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the Sondland/Yermak conversation. I understand that Mr. Morrison testified in his deposition that Ambassador Sondland proposed it might be sufficient for the Ukrainian prosecutor general to commit to pursue the investigations, as opposed to President Zelensky. But this was the first time that I had heard that the security assistance, not just the White House meeting, was conditioned on the investigation.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	… house meeting was conditioned on the investigations. Very concerned, on that same day, September 1st, I sent Ambassador Sondland a text message asking if we are now saying that the security assistance and a White House meeting are conditioned on investigations. Ambassador Sondland responded asking me to call him, which I did. During that phone call Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Ambassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling Ukrainian officials that only a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of the investigations. In fact, Ambassador Sondland said, everything was dependent on such an announcement including security assistance. He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky in a public box by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	In the same September 1st call, I told Ambassador Sondland that President Trump should have more respect for another head of state and that what he described was not in the interest of either President Trump or President Zelensky. At that point, I asked Ambassador Sondland to push back on President Trump’s demand. Ambassador Sondland pledged to try. I suggested the possibility that Ukrainian prosecutor general rather than President Zelensky would make a statement about the investigations, potentially in coordination with the Attorney General Barr’s probe into the investigation of interference in the 2016 elections.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The next day, September 2nd Mr. Morrison called to informed me that Mr. [Donneluc 00:29:54] had asked him to come to his hotel in Warsaw. So Donneluc expressed President Zelensky’s concern about the possible loss of US support for Ukraine. In particular, Mr. Morrison relayed to me that the inability of any US officials to respond to the Ukrainians explicit questions about security assistance was troubling them.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I was experiencing the same tension in my dealings with the Ukrainians, including a meeting I’d had with a defense minister that day. On September 5th, I accompanied Senators Johnson and Murphy during their visit to Kiev. When we met with President Zelensky, his first question to the senators was about the withheld security assistance. My recollection of the meeting is that both Senators stressed that bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington was Ukraine’s most important strategic asset and that President Zelensky should not jeopardize that bipartisan support by getting drawn in to US domestic politics.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I had been making and continue to make this point to all of my official Ukrainian contacts, but the odd push to make President Zelensky publicly commit to investigations of Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Two days later, September 7th, I had a conversation with Mr. Morrison in which he described a phone conversation earlier that day between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump. Mr. Morrison said that he had a sinking feeling after learning about this conversation from Ambassador Sondland. According to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland, he was not asking for a quid pro quo, but President Trump did insist that President Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself. Mr Morrison said that he told Ambassador Bolton and the NSC lawyers of this phone call between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The following day on September 8th, Ambassador Sondland and I spoke on the phone. He confirmed that he had talked to President Trump as I had suggested a week earlier, but that President Trump was adamant that President Zelensky himself had to clear things up and do it in public. President Trump said it was not a quid pro quo. I believe this was the same conversation between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump that Mr. Morrison had described to me on September 7th. Ambassador Sondland also said that he had talked to President Zelensky and Mr. [Yermak 00:04:47] and had told them that although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. I understood a stalemate to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much needed military assistance. Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelensky agreeing to make a public statement in an interview on CNN. Shortly after that call with Ambassador Sondland, I expressed my strong reservations in a text message to Ambassador Sondland stating that my nightmare is that they, the Ukrainians, give the interview and don’t get the security assistance. The Russians loved it and I quit and I was serious.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The next day, September 9th, I said to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, that the message to the Ukrainians and the Russians we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. I also said, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with the political campaign
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Ambassador Sondland responded about five hours later that I was incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear. No quid pro quos of any kind. During our meeting, during our call on September 8th, Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check. Ambassador Volker used the same language several days later while we were together at the Yalta European Strategy Conference. I argued to both that the explanation made no sense. Ukrainians did not owe President Trump anything and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was crazy. As I had said in my text message to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker on September 9th. Finally on September 11th, I learned that the hold had been lifted and security assistance would be provided. I was not told the reason why the hold had been lifted.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The next day, I personally conveyed the news to President Zelensky and the Ukrainian foreign minister and I again reminded Mr Yermak of the highest strategic value of bipartisan support for Ukraine and the importance of not getting involved in other countries’ elections. My fear at the time was since Ambassador Sondland had told me President Zelensky had already agreed to do a CNN interview, President Zelensky would make a statement regarding investigations that would have played into domestic US politics. I sought to confirm through Mr. Donneluc that President Zelensky was not planning to give such an interview to the media. While Mr. Donneluc initially confirmed that on September 12th, I noticed during a meeting on the morning of September 13th at President Zelensky’s office that Mr. Yermak looked uncomfortable in response to the question. Again, I asked Mr. Donneluc to confirm that there would be no CNN interview, which he did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	On September 25th at the UN General Assembly session in New York City, President Trump met President Zelensky face to face. He also released the transcript of the July 25th call. United States gave the Ukrainians virtually no notice of the release and they were livid. Although this was the first time I had seen the details of President Trump’s July 25th call with President Zelensky, in which he mentioned Vice President Biden, I had come to understand well before then that investigations was a term Ambassadors Volker and Sondland used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to investigations of Burisma and the Bidens.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Last Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26th. While Ambassador Volker and I visited the front as a member of my staff accompanied Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador Sondland met with Mr Yermak. Following that meeting in the presence of my staff at a restaurant Ambassador Sondland called President Trump and told him of his meetings in Kiev. The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about the investigations. Ambassador Sondland told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward. Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden which Giuliani was pressing for.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	At the time, I gave my deposition on October 22nd, I was not aware of this information. I’m including it here for completeness. As the committee knows, I reported this information through council to the state department’s legal advisor as well as to counsel for both the majority and the minority of this committee. It is my understanding that the committee is following up on this matter. Mr. Chairman, I recognize that this is rather lengthy recitation of the events of the past few months told from my vantage point in Kiev but I also recognize the importance of the matters your committee is investigating and I hope that this chronology will provide some framework for your questions. As I mentioned in my October 22nd deposition, the information in quotes in my testimony are based on my best recollection as well as a review of my personal notes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Let me return to the points I made at the outset. Ukraine is important to the security of the United States, the largest country in Europe by landmass, Ukraine is a young democracy struggling to join Europe and ally itself with the United States. It has been violently attacked by Russia, which continues its armed aggression against Ukraine to this day. If we believe in the principle of the sovereignty of nations on which our security and the security of our friends and allies depends. If we believe that nations get to decide on their own economic, political and security alliances, we must support Ukraine in its fight against its bullying neighbor. Russian aggression cannot stand.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Republican and Democratic administrations over three decades have been generous with assistance funding both civilian and military and political support. With overwhelming bipartisan majorities, Congress has imposed harsh sanctions on Russia for invading and occupying Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Chairman, there are two Ukraine stories today. The first is the one we’re discussing this morning that you have been hearing about for the past two weeks. It’s a rancorous story about whistleblowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption, and interference in elections. In this story. Ukraine is merely an object. But there’s another story, a positive bi-partisan one. In this second story, Ukraine is the subject. This one is about young people in a young nation struggling to break free of its past, hopeful that their new government will finally usher in a new Ukraine, proud of its independence from Russia, eager to join Western institutions and enjoy a more secure and prosperous life. This story describes a nation developing an inclusive democratic nationalism, not unlike what we, in America, in our best moments, feel about our diverse country. Less concerned about what language we speak, what religion, if any, we practice, where our parents and grandparents came from, more concerned about building a new country. And I’m now looking forward to your questions.  George Kent Opening Statement
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct, Mr. Chairman.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It was a cellphone.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It was.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is correct. Mr. Chairman.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	And Burisma, yes sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Chairman, the security assistance that we provide takes many forms. One of the components of that assistance is counter-battery radar. Another component are sniper weapons. These weapons and this assistance allows the Ukrainian military to deter further incursions by the Russians against Ukrainian territory. If that further incursion, further aggression were to take place, more Ukrainians would die. So it is a deterrent effect that these weapons provide. It’s also the ability … it gives the Ukranians the ability to negotiate from a position of a little more strength when they negotiate an end to the war in Donbass, negotiating with the Russians. This also is a way that would reduce the number of Ukrainians who would die.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Chairman, of course it’s hard to draw any direct lines between any particular element of security systems and any particular death on the battlefield, but it is certainly true that that assistance had enabled Ukrainian armed forces to be effective and deter and to be able to take countermeasures to the attacks that the Russians had [crosstalk 00:04:08]-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	We keep very careful track of the casualties and I noticed on the next day, information that we got that one was killed, four soldiers were wounded on that day.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Every week.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	This is significant, Mr. Chairman, because the Ukrainians in particular under this new administration are eager to end this war and they are eager to end it in a way that the Russians leave their territory. These negotiations, like all negotiations, are difficult. Ukrainians would like to be able to negotiate from a position of strength or at least more strength than they now have.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Part of that strength, part of the ability of the Ukrainians to negotiate against the Russians with the Russians for an end to the war in Donbass depends on the United States and other international support. If we withdraw, or suspend, or threatened to withdraw our security systems, that’s a message to the Ukrainians. But it’s at least as important as your question indicates, Mr. Chairman, to the Russians who are looking for any sign of weakness or any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It would.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Chairman, as my colleague, Deputy Secretary George Kent described, we have a national security policy, a national defense policy that identifies Russia and China as adversaries. The Russians are violating all of the rules, treaties, understandings that they committed to that actually kept the peace in Europe for nearly 70 years. Until they invaded Ukraine in 2014, they had abided by sovereignty of nations, of inviability of borders.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That rule of law, that order that kept the peace in Europe and allowed for prosperity as well as peace in Europe was violated by the Russians. And if we don’t push back on that, on those violations, then that will continue. And that, Mr. Chairman, effects us. It effects the world that we live in, that our children will grow up in, that our grandchildren … this affects the kind of world that we want to see overall. So that effects our national interest very directly. Ukraine is on the front line of that conflict.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Nunes, it is correct that I had not known about this before.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Exactly right.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yeah.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is still correct, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It is, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Nunes, it is. Subsequent to that, I looked into the circumstances for several of the things that you just mentioned. In 2016, candidate Trump had made a statement saying that it was possible that he would allow Crimea to go back to Russia. He expressed the sentiment or the opinion that it’s possible that Crimea wanted to go back to Russia. What I can tell you, Mr. Nunes, is that that sentiment is amazingly inflammatory to all Ukrainians. So-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t know, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That was my understanding.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He said he was more interested in the Bidens.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Chairman, I don’t know exactly what he had in mind and I’m not sure what Ambassador Sondland had in mind, who was the one who mentioned that to me, that’s the implication. The implication was it needed to be public as opposed to being a private assurance.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	So Ambassador Sondland was clearly able to have conversations with the President. And I thought that the pressure on a another president, on President Zelensky, was not a good idea from either president’s standpoint. So I suggested in that phone call with Ambassador Sondland that he, since he regularly or frequently had conversations with the President could make that point.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I asked Ambassador Sondland to push back, that’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Chairman, I was still worried that he might do that. So yes, I thought that would be a bad idea. And so when there was some indication that there might still be a plan for the CNN interview in New York, which was upcoming, at the United Nations general assembly meeting, I was worried … I wanted to be sure that that didn’t happen so I addressed it with Zelensky’s staff.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He and his advisors knew that it’s a bad idea to interject, to interfere in other nation’s elections, yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He was making plans, his staff was making plans to have him make some kind of announcement. I don’t know what it would have been, on CNN, in public.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Even though he knew it was a bad idea to interfere in other people’s elections.  Democratic Counsel Daniel Goldman’s Questioning of George Kent and Bill Taylor
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr.Goldman, I meant that because of the importance of security assistance that we had just described and had a conversation with the chairman, because that was so important. That security system was so important for Ukraine, as well as our own national interest, to withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with the political campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I mean that the United States was trying to support Ukraine as a frontline state against Russian attack. And again, the whole notion of a rules based order was being threatened by the Russians in Ukraine. So our security assistance was designed to support Ukraine. It was not just the United States, it was all of our allies.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I meant that the investigation of Burisma and the Bidens was clearly identified by Mr. Giuliani in public four months as a way to get information on the two Bidens.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	As we now know? Yes. On September 25th, that transcript was released.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No. Mr Goldman, I’ve not.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Are we now saying that security assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations?
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I had learned that in Warsaw after the meeting Vice President Pence had with President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland, I had had meetings there. And had described to Mr. Yamak, the assistant to President Zelensky, that the security assistance was also held pending announcement by President Zelensky in public of these investigations. Before that, I had only understood from Ambassador Sondland that the White House meeting was conditioned. And at this time, after I heard of this conversation, it struck me. It was clear to me that security systems was also being held.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It’s one thing to try to leverage a meeting in the White House. It’s another thing I thought to leverage security assistance, security assistance to a country at war, dependent on both the security assistance and the demonstration of support. It was much more alarming. The White House meeting was one thing. Security assistance was much more alarming.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	All of them, Mr. Goldman
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	They reflect my notes on the exact words that I heard on that call, so it was… If I put those in quotes, that meant that those are the words used on that phone call or in that conversation.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I am aware.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Correct. I understand that they may be coming sooner or later.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Several participants in the meeting, in the oval office with President Trump, with the delegation to the inauguration of President Zelensky, told me of that conversation. And it was at that meeting, as I understand it from several participants, that President Trump asked the participants to work with Mr. Giuliani on Ukraine policy.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He said that I was wrong about President Trump’s intent. That there was no quid pro quo.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Goldman, what he meant by everything was the security assistance and the White House meeting.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mistake, he told me, was earlier he had told presumably President Zelensky and Mr.Yamak that what was necessary for the White House meeting was the pursuit of these investigations and he said he recognized that that was a mistake. It was not just the White House meeting that was dependent on the investigations. He said it was now everything, it included the security assistance.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s my understanding.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It was in my notes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I understood that to mean that President Trump through Ambassador Sondland was asking for President Zelensky to very publicly commit to these investigations, that it was not sufficient to do this in private, that this needed to be a very public statement.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No further information on that.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Goldman here’s what I know. I got several questions. Other officials got several questions as well from Ukrainians asking about the security assistance. So what I know is the security assistance was very important to the Ukrainians. They had begun to hear from Ambassador Sondland that the security systems was not going to come until the investigations were pursued. What I heard from the defense minister, what the senators, what Senator Johnson and Senator Murphy heard in their conversation with President Zelensky was the clear concern, the urgent concern that the Ukrainians had about the security assistance.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Ambassador Sondland said that if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. He began that again by repeating, this is not a quid pro quo, but if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. And what I understood for in that meeting, the meaning of stalemate was the security assistance would not come.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	My understanding that’s what was meant by stalemate.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	This was an explanation that Ambassador Sondland gave me about his understanding of President Trump’s thought process. Ambassador Sondland is a businessman. President Trump’s a businessman. He was explaining to me the relationship, the, the understanding that a businessman would have when he’s about to sign a check. And by that he clearly meant that President Trump was thinking about or had in front of him the possibility of providing security assistance to Ukraine.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It was similar to writing a check to someone who you were about to send. He used that analogy very clearly to indicate that this would require something if that person owed him something before he signed the check, he wanted to get whatever he was owed, paid back to him. Ambassador Volker used very similar language about a week later, which indicates to me that they had that conversation as well.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Goldman, they didn’t. They owed appreciation for the support and they were getting support and they appreciated that, but there was nothing owed to president Trump on that.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It’s hard to understand, but there was a feeling by President Trump that he, and this came out in the transcript, I’m sorry, this came out in the discussion with the inaugural delegation when they came back to have a conversation with President Trump on May 23rd. That he had a feeling of having been wronged by the Ukrainians, and so this was something that he thought they owed him to fix that wrong.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That would have been to fix the wrong. Exactly.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Goldman, what I can do here for you today is tell you what I heard from people. And in this case it was what I heard from Ambassador Sondland. He described the conditions for the security assistance and the White House meeting in those terms that were dependent upon, conditioned on, pursuing these investigations.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Who also talked to Ambassador Sondland about the conversations that he had had in Warsaw with Ukrainians.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Goldman I know that the Ukrainians were very concerned about the security assistance. And I know that they were prepared or preparing to make a public statement that is with a CNN interview, that was being planned. Those are the two pieces that I know.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That was the implication. That was certainly the implication.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes. We were preparing, and I agreed that the White House meeting was going to be an important step in US Ukrainian relations. So in June and in early July, attempts to work out a way to get that meeting included a phone call. And so there were several conversations about how to have this phone call that eventually happened on July 25th.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Goldman, I don’t know. I don’t know what Ambassador Bolton had in mind.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The context of that comment was the discussion that Mr. Danylyuk, who was Mr. Bolton’s counterpart, Ukrainian counterpart, the national security advisor had had with Mr. Bolton. And that conversation was very substantive. Up until the point where the White House meeting was raised and Mr Ambassador Sondland intervened to talk about the investigations. It was at that point that Ambassador Bolton ceased the meeting, closed the meeting, finished the meeting, and told his staff to report this meeting to the lawyers. And he also later then indicated to Fiona Hill, who was also a participant on NSC staff, that he, Ambassador Bolton didn’t want to be associated with this drug deal. So it was in the implication was it was the domestic politics that was being cooked up.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Ambassador Sondland in the meeting where Ambassador Bolton was having a conversation with his counterpart, raised the issue of investigations being important to come before the white house meeting that had just been raised.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	And Ukrainian officials were in that meeting, yes sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t recall.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Gordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Donylyuks point that President Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic reelection politics.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	… early as an instrument in Washington domestic reelection politics.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He’s the national security advisor to the … He was. He’s no longer, but was at the time.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Danyliuk understood that these investigations were pursuant to Mr. Giuliani’s request to develop information to find information about Burisma and the Bidens. This was very well-known in public. Mr Giuliani had made this point clear in several instances in the beginning, in the springtime. And Mr. Danyliuk was aware that that was a problem.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Danyliuk indicated that President Zelensky certainly understood it, that he did not want to get involved in these type of activities.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He was.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Not in this way, Mr. Colvin. But I knew that Ambassador Volker was prepping Ukrainians for the phone call earlier on. That is, at a meeting in Toronto on July 2nd Ambassador Volker had a conversation with President Zelensky and had indicated in a phone call that he at that time was going to talk Mr. Zelensky, President Zelensky through the the steps that need to be taken in order to get to the phone call.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s an accurate state of play that I, at that point, had no indication that any discussion of the security assistance being subject to conditioned on investigations had taken place.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Right.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s what I had been told. That’s what we heard on that conference call, yes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Not to my knowledge.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s my assumption.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Castor, I don’t know what President or candidate Trump was thinking about the Ukrainians.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I heard that his response to the suggestion that Mr. Zelensky visit president Trump in the Oval Office was not well received and that he had concerns about Ukrainians, yes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Caster. I don’t know the exact nature of President Trump’s concerns. In my deposition, I recall, you handed me the political article, which listed at least three of the elements that you have described earlier and you’ve recognized and I have confirmed with the ranking minority member that it’s first I’d heard of those and was surprised by those. I don’t know President Trump’s reaction to those.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t know, Mr. Castor.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t know.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I’m sorry. What’s the question?
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Any further?
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I’m aware that there is an investigation. That’s as much as I’m aware.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Caster, can you say that one again? I’d appreciate it if you would restate the question.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Castor, The Ukrainian/American relations are very supportive. The Ukrainians will certainly be responsive to requests.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It’s appropriate for the justice department and the prosecutor general to cooperate and to exchange information, yes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Castor, I don’t know the precise appropriateness of these kinds of relations.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I was not.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct. Would not.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The same.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I didn’t, Mr. Castor. We all read the statement that the Ukrainians put out. I got a read out several days later from Mr. Morrison, National Security Council.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No, as a general rule, both United States and other countries, including Ukraine, will put out very short summaries that kind of hit the highlights of the discussion, but without going into detail.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Having read the transcript and looking back at their summary, as I recall, and I don’t recall the exact words, but they said that there were issues to be pursued in order to improve relations between the two countries or something like that.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It seems pretty ordinary.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	We were. We had a meeting within the very next day.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	So I, Mr. Volker, Mr. Sondland were in his office, and we asked him, I think, how the call. He said, “The call was fine, I was happy with the call.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Morrison, as I say, briefed me several days later, before the end of July. I think is where I said in my testimony that he said it could have gone better. And he said that the call mentioned Mr. Giuliani. He also said that the call mentioned
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	… Mr. Giuliani. He also said that the call mentioned the former ambassador. Both of those were concerning.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t recall. It could have been. Well, I have it hear of you like.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	"Again, I didn’t have the transcript at the time. All I heard was that Giuliani was mentioned; Mr. Morrison said that Giuliani was mentioned in the call."
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s what I found out when I read the transcript on the 25th of September or so.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I have no knowledge of Hunter Biden.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I’m sorry, Mr. Castor. Say again.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No knowledge.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct, Mr. Castor.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It is.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	At least a participant. There’s another leader of the regular channel.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	So I arrived in Kyiv in mid September. By late September, a couple of phone calls with-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	June, sorry.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mid-June. June 17th thank you. And so by the end of June, I had begun to hear references to investigations as something that would have to happen prior to the meeting that president Trump had offered to presidents Zelensky. And That began to raise questions for me.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I didn’t try to wrest control of the irregular channel, do that. At the time when I-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Because Ms. Castor, at the time as Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent testified both channels, both of those, both channels were interested in having a meeting between President Zelensky and President Trump. So there’s no reason to kind of wrest control if we’re going in the same direction.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I was concerned when the irregular channel appeared to be going against the overall… The irregular channel was going against the overall direction of and purpose of the regular channels.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I was concerned about Rudy Giuliani’s statements and involvement in the Ukraine policy. Yes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Not during the times relevant. Mr. Giuliani visited Ukraine one time when I was there, I think in 2007 or ’08. That’s the only time I’ve met him.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct. That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I also raised my concerns with Deputy Secretary George Kent, in particular early on when, I think I may have mentioned this phone call that was odd in that it did not include the normal staff, indeed Ambassador Sondland’s staff. And that struck me as unusual. I consulted with Mr. Kent, and at his suggestion made a note of this and also had, I think at that point I had a conversation with Mr. Brechbuhl.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The call with President Zelensky did not. The preparation for that call and the preparation included maybe 15 minutes of just the Americans that would stay on the call. And that, again, that was a little irregular in that it didn’t have the staff. It was also in that pre-call, in that 15 minutes before President Zelensky got on the phone where Ambassador Volker told the rest of the participants that he was planning to have a conversation with President Zelensky in Toronto in three days, four days, where he would outline for President Zelensky the important components of the phone call that we were trying to establish.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The only issue I had with that Mr. Castor was there was reference to investigations in, I believe, I’ll have to check my notes on that, but that there was… raised issues for me that I didn’t understand what Ambassador Volker had in mind that he was specifically going to raise with Mr. Zelensky. That was a little bit of a concern.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I’m not sure Ms. Castor, can ask you to repeat the question.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The president’s interest, or I would say Mr. Giuliani’s interest, because that’s what was very clear at the time. Mr. Giuliani’s interest in pursuing these investigations was of concern, but…
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr Castor, I don’t know.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I was not aware. I was aware of one breakfast, I think, but that’s the only one that I was aware of.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It did sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The longstanding that I’m referring to there, Dr. Wenstrup, is the longstanding political support, economic support, and increasing military support.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	They have the Javelins. Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Ms. Speier, it is certainly true that US support for Mr. Zelensky, President Zelensky, and his negotiations with the Russians is very important. And will enable him to get a better agreement with that support from the United States, both from the military assistance, but also just from the political assistance that we can provide.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He has not.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Ms. Speier, the new prosecutor general that President Zelensky has appointed, is indeed investigating crimes in general. Is that your question?
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, he is in office and is investigating criminal activity.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Nor I.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Turner, I have no evidence.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Turner, you’re asking if I ever learned something new in a meeting-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	… I learn something in every meeting, Mr. Turner. But I, you know [crosstalk 00:03:09]-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Turner, I am here to tell you what I know. I’m not going to tell you anything I don’t know. I’m going to tell you everything that I do know, and that’s-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	… that’s exactly. That’s exactly-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	… That’s exactly why I’m here.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I am telling you what I heard them tell me.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	People make mistakes, [crosstalk 00:00:04:01].
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	[inaudible 00:01:08] I was told, by the state department, don’t appear under these circumstances, that was in the letter to me, and when I got the subpoena, exactly is as Mr. Kent said, that was different circumstances and a beta legal subpoena, so, yes sir, I’m here for that reason.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Not the written statement, no sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The same.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	So true.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Welch, one of our national security goals is to resolve conflicts in Europe. There is one major conflict in Europe. It’s a fighting war. Our national security goals in support of Ukraine, in support of a broader strategic approach to Europe is to facilitate that negotiation.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Is to try to support Ukraine when it negotiates with the Russians.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s a fair statement.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That should not be the case, Mr. Welch.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I would.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Our credibility is based on a respect for the United States, and if we damage that respect, then it hurts our credibility and makes it more difficult for us to do our jobs.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Ratcliffe at some point in September …
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	July 25th sorry. Yes, that’s correct. That’s correct. They did not know this.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Ratcliffe if I can respond …
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s right. I have no reason to doubt what the president said in his press conference.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Ratcliffe if I can just respond. Let me just reiterate that I’m not here …
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I know you only got a minute left.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I’m not here to take one side or the other, that’s your [crosstalk 00:04:20].
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Ratcliffe, I would just like to say that I am not here to do anything having to do with having to decide about impeachment. That is not what either of us are here to do. This is your job. Thank you Mr. General.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	President Zelensky is very interested in U.S. support, both assistance and political support.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	If the assistance had been cut off, he would have been much weaker in his negotiations with the Russians. He would have been much weaker on the battlefield.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The Russians always look for vulnerabilities and they know that the United States has supported Ukraine. If the Russians determine or suspect that that support is lessened or not there, they will likely take advantage.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	They could have taken advantage.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Presidents Zelensky does say in the transcript that he will pursue the investigations.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Castro, as we’ve determined, as we’ve discussed here, on September 11th, just before any CNN discussion or interview, the hold was released. The hold on the security systems was released.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t know, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I’m not in a position to judge.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Attempted murder is a crime.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Neither of us is a lawyer, but I-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I think that’s right, and I’ll go out on a limb and say yes it is.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t know, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	[inaudible 00:05:13].
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, ma’am.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t think so ma’am.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I agree with Mr. Kent.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I agree.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That means it’s possible to do one but not the other. That is, if it’s completely against U.S. policy goals, then that’s a mistake, then it’s not helpful. You can go, you can get advice and even have conversations outside of the normal channels, but then they need to be part of U.S. foreign policy and approaching those goals.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Ms. Demings, I’m not sure there was an immediate impact.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	There was not. That was the impact, it was not recorded.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is the norm, but it is not unusual to not have it recorded.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, ma’am.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I came to see that Mr. Giuliani had a large influence on the irregular channel.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It is not normal. It is not unusual to ask for people outside the government to give opinions to help form the policies of the US government. It is unusual to have a person input into the channel that goes contrary to US policy.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	1969, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The height was about that time.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I was number five.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	800
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I did, sir. Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	In Vietnam.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, which is my highest I’m proudest of. There was a Bronze Star. There was a Air Medal with V.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It is.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Badly.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Because it was clear that that commander counted on us. It was clear that that commander had confidence in us. It was clear that that commander had… was appreciative of the capabilities that he was given by that assistance, but also the reassurance that we were supporting him.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He says that he shares my concern and he advises me to express that in a very special way to the secretary of state.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Once.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Rifle company commanders don’t send cables, but yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It’s a classified cable.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Without going into classified it says security assistance. It’s what we’ve been talking about today. Security assistance to Ukraine at this particular time, as in previous time, is very important. I also make the point that we’ve also talked about here today. Ukraine is important for our national security and we should support it. Not to provide that would be folly.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Not directly, no sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Secretary Kent-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	… tells me that-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t know, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I can’t, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s when I first heard about it.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Jordan it’s certainly accurate on the first two meetings because to my knowledge, the Ukrainians were not aware of the hold on assistance until the 29th of August.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The Politico article. The third meeting that you mentioned with the senators, Senator Murphy and Senator Johnson, there was discussion of the security assistance, but-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	There was not discussion of linkage.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	As I testified, Mr. Jordan, this came from Ambassador Sondland.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	So, Mr. Jordan, Should I read this?
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Oh, very good. Very good.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That is correct. That Ambassador Sondland also said that he’d talked to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak, and he told them that although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. That was one point. It was also the case-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	No, what I was going to say was Ambassador Sondland also told me that he recognized that it was a mistake to have told the Ukrainians that only the meeting with the president in the oval office was held up in order to get these investigations. No, it was not just the meeting, it was also the security assistance. That is everything was. So those two discussions-
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I did not.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I never did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s correct.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	And two of those they had never heard about it as far as I know. So there was no reason for it to come up.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	The only response… I have two responses. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and Mr. Jordan. Glad to take those questions. Let me just say that I don’t consider myself a star witness for anything.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t. I’m responding to your questions.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	As I think I was clear about, I’m not here to take one side or the other or to advocate any particular outcomes. Let me just restate that. Second thing is that my understanding is only coming from people that I talked to.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	We got that, and I think this clarification from Ambassador Sondland was because he said he didn’t remember this in his first deposition. So he wanted to kind of clarify. But I think Mr. Jordan, the way I read this, he remembers it the same way I do.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It’s very clear to me.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr., I was not wrong about what I told you, which is what I heard. That’s all I’ve said. I’ve told you what I heard…
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Mr. Jordan, the other thing that went on when that assistance who was on hold is we shook the confidence of a close partner in our reliability and that…
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	President Zolinsky’s very sensitive to the views of Ukrainian people, who indeed are very attentive to Ukrainian, US politics. Yes.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	He cannot afford to be seen to be deferring to any foreign leader. He is very confident in his own abilities and he knows that the Ukrainian people expect him to be clear and defend Ukrainian interests.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Did they get any aid in FY ’17?
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir. They did get assistance.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	They did.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Close.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yeah.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Including security assistance.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	They got some previous year some, probably FY ’18 assistance, but George, you may know.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	That’s my understanding, Mr. Hurd.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I can answer that it was only after August 29th when the political argument that I got calls from several of the Ukrainian officials.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	I don’t, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes. Mr. Yermak has expressed concern about his interactions with Mr. Giuliani.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	It was. There were meetings and there were, I think, also phone calls.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	Yes, sir.
2019-11-13	Bill Taylor	W-Taylor	W-Taylor	American businesses are very concerned about the judicial system in particular. Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Mister Chairman, ranking members, thank you for the opportunity to address the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with respect to the activities relating to Ukraine and my role in the events under investigation. I’ve dedicated my entire professional life to the United States of America. For more than two decades, it has been my honor to serve as an officer in United States Army. As an infantry officer I served multiple overseas tours including South Korea and Germany, and I was deployed to Iraq for combat operations.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Since 2008 I have been a Foreign Area Officer specializing in European and Eurasian political military affairs. I served in the United States embassies in Kiev, Ukraine and Moscow, Russia. In Washington D.C I was the political military affairs officer for Russia, for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where I drafted the Armed Forces global campaign plan to counter Russian aggression and Russian malign influence.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	In July of 2018 I was asked to serve at the White House national security council. At the NSC I’m the principal advisor to the National Security Advisor on Ukraine and other countries in my portfolio. My role at the NSC is to develop, coordinate, and implement plans and policies to manage the full range of diplomatic, informational, military and economic national security issues, the countries in my portfolio. My core function is to coordinate policy with departments and agencies.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The committee has heard from many of my colleagues about the strategic importance of Ukraine as a bulwark against Russian aggression. It is important to know that our country’s policy of supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, promoting Ukrainian prosperity, instructing a free and democratic Ukraine as a counter to Russian aggression, has been a consistent bipartisan foreign policy objective and strategy across the various administrations, both Democratic and Republican, and that president Zelensky’s election in April, 2019 created an unprecedented opportunity to realize our strategic objectives.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	In the spring of 2019 I became aware of two disruptive actors, primarily Ukraine’s then prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko and former mayor Rudolph Giuliani, president’s personal attorney, promoting false narratives that undermined the United States Ukraine policy. The NSC and its interagency partners, including the state department, grew increasingly concerned about the impact that such information was having on our country’s ability to achieve our national security objectives.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	On April 21, 2019 Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine in a landslide victory on a unity, reform, and anti-corruption platform. President Trump called President Zelensky on April 21, 2019 to congratulate him on his victory. I was the staff officer who produced the call materials and was one of the staff officers who listened to the call. The call was positive and President Trump expressed his desire to work with president Zelensky and extended an invitation to visit the White House. In May, I attended the inauguration of President Zelensky as part of the presidential delegation led by Secretary Perry.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Following the visit, the members of the delegation provided President Trump a debriefing, offering a positive assessment of President Zelensky and his team. After this debriefing, President Trump signed a congratulatory letter to President Zelensky and extended another invitation to visit the White House. On July 10, 2019 Oleksandr Danylyuk, then Ukraine’s National Security Advisor visited Washington D.C for a meeting with National Security Advisor Bolton. Ambassador Volker and Sondland, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, and Secretary Rick Perry also attended the meeting. I attended with Dr. Hill.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	We fully anticipated the Ukrainians would raise the issue of meeting, of a meeting between the presidents. Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short when Ambassador Sondland started to speak about the requirement that Ukraine deliver specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with President Trump. Following this meeting, there was a short debriefing during which Ambassador Sondland emphasized the importance of Ukraine delivering the investigations into the 2016 elections, the Bidens and Burisma.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I stated to Ambassador Sondland that this was inappropriate and it had nothing to do with national security. Dr. Hill also asserted his comments weren’t proper. Following the meeting, Dr. Hill and I agreed to report the incident to the NSC’s lead counsel, Mr. John Eisenberg. On July 21, 2019 President Zelensky won a parliamentary election in another landslide victory. The NSC proposed that President Trump call President Zelensky to congratulate him.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	On July 25, 2019 the call occurred. I listened in on the call in the situation room with White House colleagues. I was concerned by the call. What I heard was inappropriate and I reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg. It is improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a US citizen and a political opponent.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I was also clear that if Ukraine pursued investigation, it was also clear that if Ukraine pursued investigation into the 2016 elections, the Bidens and Burisma, it would be interpreted as a partisan play. This would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing bipartisan support, undermining US national security and advancing Russia’s strategic objectives in the region.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I want to emphasize to the committee that when I reported my concerns on July 10th relating to Ambassador Sondland and then July 25th relating to the President, I did so out of a sense of duty. I privately reported my concerns in official channels to the proper authority in the chain of command. My intent was to raise these concerns because they had significant national security implications for our country. I never thought that I’d be sitting here testifying in front of this committee and the American public about my actions. When I reported my concerns, my only thought was to act properly and to carry out my duty.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Following each of my reports to Mr. Eisenberg, I immediately returned to work to advance the Presidents and our country’s foreign policy objectives. I focused on what I have done throughout my military career, promoting America’s national security interests. I want to take a moment to recognize the courage of my colleagues who are appeared and are scheduled to appear before this committee. I want to say that the character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible. It is natural to disagree and engage in spirited debate. This has been the custom of our country since the time of our founding fathers, but we are better than personal attacks. The uniform I wear today is that of the United States Army, is that of the United States Army. The members of our all volunteer force are made up of a patchwork of people from all ethnicities, regions, socioeconomic backgrounds who come together under a common oath to protect and defend the constitution of the United States of America.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	We do not serve any political party. We serve the nation. I am humbled to come before you today as one of many who serve in the most distinguished and able military in the world. The Army is the only profession I have ever known. As a young man I decided I wanted to spend my life serving this nation. It gave my family that gave my family refuge from authoritarian depression. For the last 20 years it has been an honor to represent and protect this great country.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Next month will mark 40 years since my family arrived in the United States as refugees. When my father was 47 years old, he left behind his entire life and the only home he had ever known to start over in the United States so his three sons could have a better and safer lives.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	His courageous decision inspired a deep sense of gratitude in my brothers and myself, and instilled in us a sense of duty and service. All three of us have served or are currently serving in the military. My little brother sits behind me here today. Our collective military service is a special part of our family’s history and story in America.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I also recognize that my simple act of appearing here today, just like the courage of my colleagues who have also truthfully testified before this committee would not be tolerated in many places around the world. In Russia, my act of expressing concern to the chain of command in an official and private channel would have severe personal and professional repercussions, and offering public testimony involving the president would surely cost me my life. I am grateful for my father’s brave act of hope 40 years ago and for the privilege of being an American citizen and public servant, where can live free, and free of fear for mine and my family’s safety.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Dad, I’m sitting here today in the US Capitol talking to our elected professionals, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union, come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth. Thank you again for your consideration. I’ll be happy to answer your questions.  Questioning
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Those were the recommended talking points that were cleared through the NSC staff for the president, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	To the best of my recollection, he did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, chairman.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, chairman.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	During a bilateral meeting in which the whole delegation was meeting with President Zelensky and his team, I offered two pieces of advice. To be particularly cautious with regards to Russia and it’s desire to provoke Ukraine and the second one was to stay out of US domestic policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Politics, correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Chairman, in the March and April timeframe it became clear that there were actors in the US … Public actors, non-governmental actors that were promoting the idea of investigations and 2016 Ukrainian interference and it was consistent with us policy to advise any country, all the countries in my portfolio, any country in the world to not participate in US domestic politics. So I was passing the same advice consistent with US policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is consistent. The review was to ensure it remained consistent with administration policies.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	To the best of my recollection, Ambassador Sondland said that in order to get a White House meeting, the Ukrainians would have to provide a deliverable, which is investigations. Specific investigations.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	We had not completed all of the agenda items and we still had time for the meeting and Ambassador Bolton abruptly ended the meeting.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	May have not been entirely clear at that moment. Certainly Ambassador Sondland was calling for these meetings and he had stated that he had this … This was developed per conversation with the Chief of Staff, Mr. Mick Mulvaney, but the connection to the president wasn’t clear at that point.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Chairman, without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House council. I had concerns and it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Well, chairman, as I said in my statement, it was inappropriate. It was improper for the president to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there’s at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation and that would have significant implications if it became public knowledge and it would be perceived as a partisan play. It would undermine our Ukraine policy and it would undermine our national security.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Chairman, the culture I come from the, the military culture. When a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not to be taken as a request. It’s to be taken as an order. In this case, the power disparity between the two leaders, my impression is that in order to get the White House meeting President Zelensky would have to deliver these investigations.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I attributed that to the fact that this transcript that is being produced may have not caught the word Burisma and in the transcript that was released, it was released as accompany, which is accurate. It’s not a significant omission.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s right. I’d say it’s informed speculation that the folks that produced these transcripts do the best they can and they just didn’t catch the word. And that was my responsibility to then make sure that the transcript was as accurate as possible. And that’s what I attempted to do by putting that word back in because that was in my notes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It seemed unlikely that he would be familiar with a single company in the context of a call that was on the broader bilateral relationship and it seemed to me that he was either tracking this issue because it was in the press or he was otherwise prepped.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I wasn’t aware of them at the time.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	During the course of the testimony and the depositions after this impeachment inquiry began.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not aware of any of these interference efforts.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The only thing I’m aware of pertains to his deposition.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not aware of this fact.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I guess I didn’t independently look into it. I’m just not aware of what kind of payments Mr. Biden may received. This is not something I’m aware of.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not aware of these meetings.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not aware of any of these facts.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m aware of the fact that president Biden or vice president Biden was a very engaged on Ukraine and had numerous engagements. That’s what I’m aware of.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	We have an NSC press shop and they field any of these types of questions. I do not engage with the press at all.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	We have an NSC press shop whose job is to engage on any of these types of questions. I am not aware, but it is possible and likely that the press shop would field these types of questions.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Thank you ranking member for clarifying. I do not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I did. My core function is to coordinate U.S. government policy, interagency policy, and I spoke to two individuals with regards to providing some sort of readout of the call.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Not in the White House, cleared U.S. government officials with appropriate need to know.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Department of state, department of state deputy assistant secretary George Kent, who is responsible for the portfolio, Eastern Europe including Ukraine, and an individual from the office of… An individual in the intelligence community.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ranking member, it’s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do not know who the whistleblower is, that is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Per the advice of my counsel, I’ve been advised not to answer specific questions about members of the intelligence community.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Of course, I am.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ranking member, per the advice of my counsel and the instructions from the chairman, I’ve been advised not to provide any specifics on who I’ve spoken to with inside the intelligence community. What I can offer is that these were properly cleared individuals or was a properly cleared individual with a need to know.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	This is not in the public record and I can’t comment too deeply, but the areas that we’ve consistently talked about in public, it was cooperation on supporting reform agenda, anti corruption efforts, and helping President Zelensky implement his plans to end Russia’s war against Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, that is my job is to coordinate U.S. policy, so throughout the preceding year that I had been on staff, I had undertaken an effort to make sure we had a cohesive, coherent U.S. policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Counsel, the president could choose to use the talking points or not, he’s the president, but they were not consistent with what I provided, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, it was not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I was.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am well aware of that fact.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It is the consensus of the entire intelligence community that the Russians interfered in U.S. elections in 2016.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It was not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It was not consistent with the policy as I understood it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	My understanding is that it was, the connection to investigate into a political opponent, was inappropriate and improper. I made that connection as soon as the president brought up the Biden investigation.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Not that I can recall.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	To the best of my recollection, in the August timeframe, the Ukrainian Embassy started to become aware of the hold on security assistance and they were asking if I had any comment on that or if I could substantiate that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe I said that… I don’t recall, frankly. I don’t recall what I said, but I believe it may have been something along the lines of, “I’m not aware of it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ukraine is in a war with Russia, and the security assistance that we provide Ukraine is significant. Absent that security assistance, and maybe even more importantly, the signal of support for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, that would likely encourage Russia to potentially escalate to pursue further aggression, further undermining Ukrainian sovereignty, European security, and U.S. security.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I speak Russian and Ukrainian and a little bit of English.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I know he made a valiant effort to speak English. He had been practicing up his English, but he also spoke Ukrainian.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Andriy Yermak is a senior advisor within the Ukrainian presidential administration. He’s a senior advisor to President Zelensky.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	… to Ukrainian presidential administration. He’s a senior advisor to President Zelensky.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	This would be consistent, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It could be taken that way, but I’m not sure if I… It seems like a reasonable conclusion.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Seemingly so.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The show of support for President Zelensky, still a brand new president, frankly, a new politician on the Ukrainian political scene looking to establish his bonafides as a regional and maybe even a world leader would want to have a meeting with the United States, the most powerful country in the world, and Ukraine’s most significant benefactor in order to be able to implement his agenda.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	At this point, I had already been tracking this initially what I would describe as alternative narrative, false narrative, and I was certainly aware of the fact that it was starting to reverberate, gain traction. The fact that it, in the July 10th call ended up being pronounced by a public official, Ambassador Sondland had me alerted to this, and I was subsequent to that report. I was invited to follow up with any other concerns to Mr. Eisenberg.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	There was, following the report, there was a discussion in legal shop on the best way to manage the transcript, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	My understanding is that this was viewed as a sensitive transcript, and to avoid leaks, and if I recall the term properly, or something along the lines of preserve the integrity of the transcript, it should be segregated to a smaller group of folks.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not sure I… I mean, it seems like a legal term. I’m not an attorney, but it was… I didn’t take it as anything nefarious. I just, I understood that they wanted to keep it in a smaller group.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Not necessarily. The way these edits occur, they go through like everything else a approval process. I made my contribution. It was cleared by Mr. Morrison. Then when I returned it… Sometimes that doesn’t happen. There are administrative errors. I think in this case I didn’t see it, didn’t… When I first saw the transcript without the two substantive I had attempted to include, I didn’t see that as nefarious. I just saw it as, “Okay, no big deal. These might be meaningful, but it’s not that big a deal.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	There was a reference in a section… One second. Yeah, on page four, the top paragraph. Let me find the right spot.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Okay.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, you can look into it. Ellipse. There are videos-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	…if I recall-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	… or they’re recordings. Recordings.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I understood that it was being segregated into a separate system, separate secure system.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	This is definitely not unprecedented, but at times, if you want to limit access to a smaller group of folks, you put it on the secure system to ensure that a smaller group of people with access to the secure system have it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	You can do that, but to the best of my recollection, the decision was made, frankly, on the fly. After I conveyed my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg, Mr. Ellis came in. He hadn’t heard the entire conversation, and when it was mentioned that it was sensitive, it was kind of on-the-fly decision to just segregate it in this other system.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not sure I understand.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think it was intended, but again, it was intended to prevent leaks and to limit access.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Maybe that’s a bit of a… It’s not entirely accurate, but I’m not sure if I would describe it as false. It was consistent with US policy, and these items are used as messaging tools also, so a statement that goes out, in addition to reading out the meeting itself is also a messaging platform to indicate what is important with regards to US policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Certainly.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	For the April 21st call-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry to correct it, so she was a recalled prior … let me see. So, the notification occurred towards the end of April and she was finally recalled in May timeframe, I think May 20th if I recall correctly.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I was.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I was aware that he was traveling there and that he had been promoting the idea of these investigations.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	As I recall, he referred to specific investigations that Ukrainians would have to deliver in order to get these meetings.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ambassador Bolton very abruptly ended the meeting.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	There was a photo opportunity that we leveraged in order to demonstrate US support. So the White House visit demonstrated US support for Ukraine and the new national security advisor who was a technocrat. And then after that, we went down to a short post-meeting huddle or debrief.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	They were.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ambassador Sonland referred to investigations into the Bidens Burisma in 2016.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I said that these requests to conduct these meetings was inappropriate. These investigations was inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t recall specifically. I believe he was there for at least a portion of the time. I don’t recall if he was there for the whole meeting
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe there was some discussion. Prior to the Ukrainians leaving when it was apparent there was some discord between the senior folks, Ambassador Sondland and other White House staff, myself, they were asked to step out. So, I don’t recall if they were there for the entire discussion.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	John Eisenberg said that he took notes while I was talking and he said that he would look into it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Because it was inappropriate and following the meeting, I had a short conversation following the post-meeting meeting in the wardroom. I had a short conversation with Dr. Hill. And we discussed the idea of needing to report this.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That was the first time I was aware of the Ukrainians being approached directly by a government official.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am aware and I was aware.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t believe I was aware of that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The first I heard of the whistleblower complaint is I believe when the news broke, I was only aware of the committees investigating the hold on security assistance.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry, I didn’t understand that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	So, the inter agency policy was to support security assistance for Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I certainly would describe it as a substantively correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry, could you say that question again?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Oh, I had it in my notes, I know that’s what he said, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Okay.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	So I think it followed the appropriate process in terms of making sure that eventually it came around for clearances, for accuracy, but it was in a different system.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I can say for myself, the concerns about leaks seemed valid and wasn’t particularly critical. I thought this was sensitive and I was not going to question the attorney’s judgment on that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t recall but there are concerns, there are broad concerns about corruption, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I think that would be in the context of a military assistance. In terms of burden-sharing, the European union provides over $15 billion.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Has provided since 2014.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I am.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is my understanding, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not aware of … I guess I couldn’t point to specific investigations, but there is what I would call a pattern of questionable dealings and questions about corruption.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I came to learn that that is correct, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I would defer to George Kent, he’s a fount of knowledge on Ukraine, much deeper knowledge than I have. If he attested to that, then I’d take his word for it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I understand he testified that, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I heard him mention that. These are events that occurred before my time. So frankly, beyond what he said, I don’t know much more.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Certainly, I learned that at some point, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I came to learn that as well.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t know much about Mr. Hunter Biden.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	As far as I can tell, he didn’t seem to be. But like I said, I don’t know his qualifications.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Are we talking about the ward room or are we talking about the actual meeting with Ambassador Bolton?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	So from the US side, we had Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, I believe there was another, a special assistant to the President, Wells Griffith was in there, and myself. From the Ukrainians-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	For the Ukrainian side, we had Oleksandr Danylyuk, Andriy Yermak, and I think Oleksandr Danylyuk’s advisor, Oleksii Semeniy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I noted that it ended abruptly, but frankly, I didn’t exactly know why.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He did not. To the best of my recollection, I don’t think he did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think Ambassador Bolton was exceptionally qualified. He understood the strategic communications opportunity of having a photo. And we prompted him to, before we completely adjourned, to see if he was willing to do a photo. And he did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I certainly took a couple of them, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s right.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s right. Yeah.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes. And I apologize. When I was running through the US side, of course, Ambassador Bolton, Volker, and Sondland were there, and Secretary Perry was there.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I certainly was following news accounts, and that’s from the Ukrainian side, Ukrainian press and US press.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	And my colleagues in the inner agency also were concerned about this, as this had started in the March timeframe, kind of emanating from the John Solomon story all the way through. So there had been ongoing conversations. So several different sources, Counsel.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Definitely.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yeah. So I believe it’s in the deposition, the three elements, Burisma, Bidens, and the 2016 elections were all mentioned.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe that I actually followed up. Because this question was asked multiple times. I said all three elements were in there, so-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	… maybe picked out a point where I could-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I guess that’s a term now.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I certainly was excluded or didn’t participate in the trip to Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus at the end of August. Initially, before it changed from a POTUS trip to a Vice President trip to Warsaw, I wasn’t participating in that one. So I didn’t miss that. No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Mr. Morrison… I was on leave. I was supposed to be on leave from the 3rd of August through about the 16th or so of August. And he called me and asked me to return. There was obviously high priority travel to the region. He needed my assistance to help plan for it, and asking me to return early from leave, which I take infrequently. I assumed that I’d be going on the trip. So when I was-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Frequently, I assumed that I’d be going on the trip. So after returning from leave early, when I was told I wasn’t going, I inquired about it, correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He initially told me that the aircraft that was acquired, the MILAIR was too small and there wasn’t enough room.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Did I ever have any conversations with Mr. Morrison about it?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	They did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Well, certainly it was concerning. He had just come on board. He wasn’t steeped in all the items that we were working on, including the policy that we’d developed over the preceding months. And I thought I could contribute to that, to the performance of his duties.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe it was three times.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t know, but every single time I dismissed it. Upon returning, I notified my chain of command and the appropriate counterintelligence folks about the offer.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think it would be a great honor, and frankly, I’m aware of service members that have left service to help nurture the developing democracies in that part of the world, certainly in the Baltics. Former officers, and if I recall correctly, it was an air force officer that became minister of defense. But I’m an American. I came here when I was a toddler and I immediately dismissed these offers. Did not entertain them.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yeah, Counsel, you know what? The whole notion is rather comical that I was being asked to consider whether I’d want to be the minister of defense. I did not leave the door open at all.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	But it is pretty funny for a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, which really is not that senior, to be offered that illustrious a position.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Oh, Mr Danylyuk is a absolutely flawless English speaker. He was speaking in English?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	And just to be clear, there were two other staff officers, embassy key of staff officers, that were sitting next to me when this offer was made.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	So one of them you may have met, it was Mr David Holmes, and the other one was… I don’t know, I mean, I guess I could… It’s another foreign service officer, Keith Bean.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I understand. He’s a delightful fellow.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did. But I also don’t know if I fully entertained it as a legitimate offer. I was just making sure that I did the right thing in terms of reporting this.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	And I believe our Deputy Senior Director, John Erath, was there. Once I mentioned it to both of them, I don’t believe there was ever a followup discussion.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Following that conversation I had with Dr Hill, I don’t believe there was a subsequent conversation. And I don’t recall ever having a conversation with Dr Kupperman about it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, I completely forgot about it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It never came up again.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	So frankly, it’s more important about what my American leadership, American chain of command thinks than any of the… And these are honorable people. I’m not sure if he meant it as a joke or not, but it’s much more important what my civilian, White House National Security Council chain of command thinks more so than anybody else. And frankly, if they were concerned about me being able to continue my duties, they would’ve brought that to my attention. Dr hill stayed on for several more months and we could continue to work to advance US policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I recall a courtesy note for Mr Yermak within days of his return to July, in which he wanted to preserve an open channel communication. And I said, “Please feel free to contact me with any concerns.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yeah, so I’m trying to recall at which point I became aware of Ambassador… Certainly I was aware of the fact that they were working together. Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker and Secretary Perry were working together to advance US policy interests that were in support of what had been agreed to. But I didn’t really learn, like I said, until the July 10th… Actually there might may have been a slightly earlier point. I recall a meeting in which Ambassador Bolton facilitated a meeting between Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Bolton in the June timeframe, and there may have been some discussion about this external channel. But I frankly didn’t become aware of these particular US government officials being involved in this alternate track until on July 10th.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct. That is exactly what was being reported by the intelligence community, by the policy channels within the NSC, and the conservative voices of the various people that have actually met with him, including foreign officials.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is what I believed and that is what I still believe, frankly.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think they were trying to bring him into the tent and have him kind of support the direction that we had settled on.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I only know him as New York’s finest mayor.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	America’s Mayor.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’ve never had any contact with the president of the United States.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	There was not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	In my mind there was not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s right.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I learned shortly after she was finished talking to Ambassador Bolton and after we wrapped up with the wardroom that she did have a meeting with them and that’s what was expressed.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is my recollection, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is my understanding.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is my understanding.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Chairman, without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House council. I had concerns, and it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Well, chairman, as I said in my statement, it was inappropriate, it was improper for the president to request and to demand an investigation in to a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there’s at best, dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation. And that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge and it would be perceived as a partisan play. It would undermine our Ukraine policy, and it would undermine our national security.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Chairman, the culture I come from, the military culture, when a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not to be taken as a request. It’s to be taken as an order. In this case, the power disparity between the two leaders, my impression is that in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelinsky would have to deliver these investigations.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I attributed that to the fact that this transcript that is being produced, may have not caught the word Burisma. In the transcript that was released, it was released as the company, which is accurate. It’s not a significant omission.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s right. I’d say it’s informed speculation that the folks that produce these transcripts do the best they can, and they just didn’t catch the word. And that was my responsibility to then make sure that the transcript was as accurate as possible. And that’s what I attempted to do by putting that word back in because that was in my notes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It seemed unlikely that he would be familiar with a single company, in the context of a call that was on the broader bilateral relationship. And it seemed to me that he was either tracking this issue because it was in the press, or he was otherwise prepped.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The show of support for President Zelensky, still a brand new president, frankly, a new politician on the Ukrainian political scene, looking to establish his bona fides as a regional, and maybe even a world leader, would want to have a meeting with the United States, the most powerful country in the world, and Ukraine’s most significant benefactor in order to be able to implement his agenda.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct. That is exactly what was being reported by the intelligence community, by the policy channels within the NSC, and the conservative voices of the various people that have actually met with him, including foreign officials.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is what I believed, and that is what I still believe, frankly.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think they were trying to bring him into the tent and have him kind of support the direction that we had settled on.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I only know him as New York’s finest mayor.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	America’s mayor.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It’s a combat infantryman’s badge.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	You have to be serving in a brigade and below a tactical unit. That means a fighting unit. Front line unit in combat.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	In 2014, in the ramp up to probably the largest urban operation in in decades outside of Fallujah, we were conducting a reconnaissance patrol in conjunction with the Marines, and my vehicle was struck by a improvised explosive device that penetrated the armor.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I was.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Representative, I’d call myself Never Partisan.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Never.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	None.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	As I recall, he referred to specific investigations that Ukrainians would have to deliver in order to get these meetings.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The White House meeting
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ambassador Bolton very abruptly ended the meeting.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	There was a photo opportunity that we leveraged in order to demonstrate US support. So the White House visit, demonstrating US support for Ukraine, and the new National Security Advisor who is a technic technocrat. And then after that we went down to a short post-meeting huddle, or debrief.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	They were.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ambassador Sondland referred to investigations into the Bidens, Burisma in 2016.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I I said that these requests to conduct these meetings was inappropriate. These investigations was inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t recall, specifically. I believe he was there for at least a portion of the time. I don’t recall if he was there for that, the whole meeting.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe there was some discussion prior to the Ukrainians leaving, when it was apparent there was some discord between the senior folks, Ambassador Sondland and other White House staff, myself. They were asked to step out. So I don’t recall if they were there for the entire discussion.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	John Eisenberg has said that he took notes while I was talking, and he said that he would look into it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Because it was inappropriate. And following the meeting, I had a short conversation, following the post-meeting meeting, in the ward room, I had a short conversation with Dr. Hill, and we discussed the idea of needing to report this.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That was the first time I was aware of the Ukrainians being approached directly by a government official.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, I did. My core function is to coordinate U.S. government policy, interagency policy, and I spoke to two individuals with regards to providing some sort of readout of the call.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Not in the White House, cleared U.S. government officials with appropriate need-to-know.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Department of State, Deputy Assistant Secretary, George Kent, who is responsible for the the portfolio, Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. And a individual from the office of, an individual in the intelligence community.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ranking member, it’s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do not know who the whistleblower is, that is correct?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Per the advice of my counsel, I’ve been advised not to answer specific questions about members of the intelligence community.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Of course I am.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ranking Member, per the advice of my counsel and the instructions from the Chairman, I’ve been advised not to provide any specifics on who I’ve spoken to with inside the intelligence community. What I can offer is that these were properly cleared individuals, or was a properly clear individual with a need-to-know.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It is to coordinate United States policy vis-a-vis Ukraine. Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I understood that to mean both his public commentary, so publicly calling for investigations into 2016 Burisma and Hunter Biden, as well as his direct overtures to the government of Ukraine directly and through proxies. That’s what I understood.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Congresswoman, I don’t know.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry, could you say that again? Ma’am?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes. I think to be clear, I think you’re referring to debunking that it was a Russian interference-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	… and how implicating themselves that it was Ukrainian interference, I’m not sure.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It was not part of any process that I participated in.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes. They were.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe they did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not sure what they frankly understood about US [crosstalk 00:03:48]. I think they understood the implications. Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I counseled them, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It is what I knew for a fact to be us policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Congresswoman, the first thought that comes to mind is Russian interference and interference in 2016. The impact that had on internal politics and the consequences it had for Russia itself.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	This administration enforced heavy sanctions against Russia for their interference and that would not be in US policy to [crosstalk 00:04:54]-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I understand ma’am.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t know if I have the experience to say that, but it certainly wasn’t helpful and it didn’t help advance US national security interests.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I would.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m aware of it now.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not aware of specific incidents, but my understanding is that it would not be out of the realm of the possible for Burisma.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Certainly the potential, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	On or about July 3rd.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	On or about July 3rd, I became aware of inquiries into security assistance funding in general. There are two typical pots, State Department and DOD, and I believe it was around that date that OMB put a hold on congressional notification.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Prior to that there were some general inquiries on how the funds were being spent, things of that nature. Nothing specific. No holds certainly.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	None.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It was raised on several occasions.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	So following the July 18th Sub-PCC, which is, again, what I coordinate or what I convene at my level, there was a July 23rd PCC that would have been conducted by Mr. Morrison. There were questions raised as to the legality of the hold. Over the subsequent week, the issue was analyzed and during the July 26th… Deputies, the deputies from all the departments and agencies, there was opinion rendered that it was legal to put the hold.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	There was an opinion, legal opinion, rendered that the hold was legal.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Congressman, I am not. And furthermore, I would say that this is a Russian narrative that President Putin has promoted.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, I’m not aware of it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Congressman, the Ukrainian judiciary is imperfect at the moment, and the reliance on U.S. support could conceivably causes them to tip the scales of justice in favor of finding the U.S. Edison guilty if they thought they needed to do that in our national security-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	They could and Ukraine is making progress certainly more broadly in Russia. That is likely to happen where the state will be involved in judicial outcomes and drive them.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think that’s a fair characterization, Congressman.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	There are different estimates, but it’s on that scale, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct, and 100 died.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That amounts to some of their key pillars.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry. Could you say that again?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	They said that … I believe the words were something to the effect of if you have any other concerns, feel free to come back.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is what I heard him say.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I have not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	After I reported it to the … I’m sorry. Oh, I’m sorry. Could you say that again? I apologize.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	To Ambassador Solomon, if I understood you correctly, I stated that it was inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security policy.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I reported the same thing that … I reported the content of the conversation with Ambassador Solomon. At that point, I wasn’t aware that Dr. Hill had a conversation with Ambassador Bolton. And so I just relayed what I experienced to the attorney, lead legal counsel.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	After the July 10th meeting, yes ma’am, that is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, he is the senior between the two, certainly.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ma’am, I think they stand on their own. I don’t think it’s necessarily to expand on it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Since the report on July 25th as I stated, I did notice I was being excluded from several meetings that would have been appropriate for my position.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not sure if I could make that judgment. I could say that it would was out of the course of normal affairs to not have me participate in some of these events.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did, I prepared them.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	They did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, I’m not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Nothing that we prepared or had discussed up until that point included any of these elements.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	There are proper procedures in which to do that. Certainly the President is well within his right to do that. It is not something the NSC, certainly a director at the NSC would do. As a matter of fact, we are prohibited from being involved in any transaction between Department of Justice and a foreign power to ensure that there is no perception of manipulation from the White House. So it is not something that we’d participate in.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I had not seen any reference to those particular cases in our policy formulation process.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Lawyers back there?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Nine minutes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yeah, lifetime wisdom there.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not an attorney but it doesn’t seem so.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did not. I didn’t render any opinion on what was asked in the 25.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Without their knowledge? No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, Representative Jordan, I guess I’ll start by reading Dr. Hill’s own words, as she attested to in my last evaluation that was dated middle of July, right before she left. “Alex is a top 1% military officer and the best army officer I’ve worked with in my 15 years of government service. He is brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	“He was exemplary during numerous visits,” so forth and so on. But I think you get the idea. Mr. Morrison, yeah, the date of that was, yeah, let’s see, I’m sorry, July 13th. So Mr. Jordan, I would say that I can’t say why Mr. Morrison questioned my judgment. We had only recently started working together. He wasn’t there very long, and we were just trying to figure out our relationship. Maybe it was a different culture, it was a military culture versus-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I never did, never would. That is preposterous that I would do that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Mr. Jordan, on call readout, certainly after the first call, there were probably a half a dozen or more people that I read out. Those are people with the proper clearance and the need to know. In this case, because of the sensitivity of the call, and Mr. Eisenberg told me not to speak to anybody else, I only read out, outside of the NSC, two individuals.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	DAS Kent and one other person.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	And you’re not willing to tell us who that other individual is?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That meeting occurred in the afternoon and within a couple hours, I’m sure it was within a couple of hours I spoke to Mr. Eisenberg, how did he react?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He was cool, calm and collected. He took notes and he said he would look into it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He did, Congressman.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He took notes and he said he was going to follow up or look into it. I don’t recall exactly what he said.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He’s an assistant to the President. It was less a suggestion and more of an instruction.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That that is not correct with regards to timing, they didn’t circle back around. What ended up happening is in my coordination role, I spoke to State, I spoke to a member of the intelligence community and the general counsel from one of the intelligence bodies notified Mr. Eisenberg that there was information on the call, on the July 25th call. At that point, Mr. Eisenberg told me I shouldn’t talk to anybody else about it.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, Congressman, it happened in 2004 but yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No. Frankly, Congressman, I suffered light wounds. I was fortunate compared to my counterparts in the same vehicle and I returned to duty I think it may have been that same day.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I continued to serve in combat for the remaining 10 or 11 months of the tour.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Mr. Morrison has left the position some time ago already. At least three weeks ago.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Typically, I frankly, at that level, they don’t really take talking points, especially if they have expertise. The talking points are more intended for national security advisor, although Ambassador Bolton didn’t really require it because of his deep expertise. It’s the next level up. The President-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I know.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t believe so.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, it is not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is accurate.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He was sworn in on May 20, 2019.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That was July 21, 2019.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s right. That’s when they won and they weren’t seated until August.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He didn’t.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is accurate.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Of course. Yup.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, it is. It is significant.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think it was just the one time from the Presidential Delegation. Multiple engagements, but just the one trip.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That was in a larger, bilateral format. Then there were a couple of smaller venue … There was never a one on one, but there were a couple of, again, touchpoints. So the bilateral meeting, handshake, meet and greet. He had a short-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yeah.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	We did have a huddle beforehand and it’s possible I flagged them, but I don’t recall specifically. It’s possible I didn’t.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I would.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m aware of it now.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m not aware of specific incidents, but my understanding is that it would not be out of the realm of the possible for Burisma.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Certainly the potential, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The system itself and the signaling of U.S. support, yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	In my advisory [crosstalk 00:00:04:54].
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Just to clarify, only in my advisory capacity, I advise up through the chain of command. That’s what I do.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Absolutely.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I went immediately, per the instructions from the July 10th incident, I went immediately to Mr. Eisenberg. After that, once I expressed my concerns, it was an extremely busy week. We had a PCC just finish, we had the call, and then we had a deputies meeting, which consumed all of my time. I was working extremely long days. I attempted to try to communicate, I managed to speak to two folks in the interagency. I attempted to try to talk to Mr. Morrison. That didn’t happen before I received instructions from John Eisenberg to not talk to anybody else any further.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	No, he didn’t tell me until … What ended up unfolding is I had the conversation with the attorney, I did my coordination, my core function, which is coordination. I spoke to the appropriate people within the interagency. And then, circling back around, Mr. Eisenberg came back to me and told me not to talk to anybody else.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, but there’s a whole, there’s a period of time in there between when I spoke to him and when he circled back around. It wasn’t that long a period of time, but it was enough time for me to [crosstalk 00:04:21]-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I have been instructed not to, Representative Jordan.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Representative Jordan, I did my job.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is incorrect.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is incorrect.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry, Chairman, but-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	… that sequence is not the way it played out. I spoke to the attorney-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The sequence played out where, immediately afterwards, I expressed my concerns, I did my coordination function. Mr. Eisenberg circled back around and told me not to talk to anybody else. In that period of time, I did not manage to talk to-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s right.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Mr. Stewart, Representative Stewart, I’m in uniform. I’m wearing my military rank. I just thought it was appropriate to stick with that. [crosstalk 00:00:52].
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry, Mr. Stewart. I apologize. I don’t believe he did, but the attacks that I’ve had in the press, in Twitter have either marginalized me as a military officer or-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Representative when a superior makes a request, that’s an order.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think that is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He is not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Not that I’m aware of.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I don’t believe so. I don’t know.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Representative, I made that judgment. I stick by that judgment.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The context of this call, consistent with the July 10th meeting with the reporting that was going on, including the President’s personal attorney, made it clear that this was not simply a request.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is not what I understand. I frankly don’t have any firsthand knowledge of that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’ve seen the video.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Congressmen, this is something I actually participated in.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I witnessed. That I don’t know.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I frankly don’t know that much more about that particular incident. I saw the snippet of the video, but I don’t know if I could make a judgment off that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I immediately went to John Eisenberg, the lead legal counsel.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry- [crosstalk 00:00:42].
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	So, I reported it to John Eisenberg. I attempted to report it to Mr. Morrison.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He didn’t avail himself, and at that point, I was told not to speak-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, thank you.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I’m sorry, my lawyer was talking. Could you say that again please, doctor?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That’s not typically what would happen. It would be, frankly, it would be ambassador Bolton-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yeah. Congressman in this statement I issued this morning, I’d probably ease that back. I took that off my job description that I have on my eval, but I certainly spent much more time advising the ambassador than I did the president. I had no [crosstalk 00:00:50].
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is not what I read into the transcript. That might’ve been what I had in there yesterday when I was drafting it, but I chose to ease back on that language even though it was in my evaluation just because I didn’t want to overstate my role.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	But Congressman, what I’m saying is what I read into the record this morning didn’t say that.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes. Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I agree with Ms. Williams.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Just to be again accurate. I said, “False narrative.” Just because that’s what I said in the record this morning. But I have not met him.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ah, no. Just what I saw him… his comments on TV…
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	…and the news. Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I advised him indirectly. I made all his preparations for the calls and for his engagements.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do, representative.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He does not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He does not. We coordinate but…
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Congressman, at my level, I convene what’s called a sub policy coordinating committee. That’s deputy assistant secretary. I coordinate with… I chair those meetings and I bring together those folks.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	According to the NSPM 4, the policy signed by the president…
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	…policy should be coordinated by the…
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	…by the NSC. Correct? We help advise him.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Not that I’m aware of.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	We sometimes refer to Ukraine as a frontline state. It’s on the front line of Europe. They have actually described it to me, the Ukrainians, that it is a… they consider themselves as a barrier between Russian aggression and Europe. And what I’ve heard them describe is the need for US support in order to serve this role in order to protect European and Western security.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Lieutenant Colonel, this is not just a theoretical conflict between Ukraine and Russia. You’ve already said this morning that Russia is actively fighting to expand into Ukraine, that Ukraine is in a hot war with Russia right now. Is that correct?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	It’s stable, but it’s still a hot war.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	And isn’t it true a Lieutenant Colonel, that even if the security was eventually delivered to Ukraine, the fact that it was delayed, just that fact, could signal to Russia that the bond between Ukraine and the US was weakening?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That was the concern of myself and my colleagues.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	And was the risk of even the appearance that the US Ukraine bond is shaky, is that it could embolden Russia to act with more aggression? Would you say that’s correct?
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe that was my testimony.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Just last month during an interview. President Putin joked about interfering in our political elections. I can only guess that’s what we have become to Russia and its president. I think he felt emboldened by the President’s reckless actions, both attempts to hold critical military aid from Ukraine and President Trump’s effort to blame a Ukraine, not Russia for election interference.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Ms. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. I can only say that every American, regardless of our politics, should be critically concerned about that. And let me just say this. Yes, we do trust the American people. But you know what? The American people trust us to as members of Congress to support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and we intend to do just that. Thank you again for your service. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Hopefully the last.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Frankly, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukrainian policy could play out was playing out. How this was likely to have significant implications for US national security.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I did.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Because that was my duty.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The [crosstalk 00:03:52]-
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I think my dad would appreciate this one too. Dad, my sitting here today in the US Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I’ll be fine for telling the truth.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I knew I was assuming a lot of risk.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He did serve. It was a different military though.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He deeply worried about it because in his context it was the ultimate risk.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I’ve served and defended, that all of my brothers have served, and here right matters.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He re-established himself in his former profession in the United States.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	He did not.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe so.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Correct.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Yes.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	The Ukrainians needed the meeting. The Ukrainians, subsequently, when they found out about it, needed the security assistance.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I believe so.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	Superb individual.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I do.
0201-11-19	Lt Col Vindman	W-Vindman	W-Vindman	I am.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and ranking member. Thank you very much for the opportunity to provide this testimony today. As you know, I was the first person to come forward to testify as part of this inquiry. I did so voluntarily and likewise voluntarily provided relevant documentation in my possession in order to be as cooperative, clear and complete as possible. I am here today voluntarily and I remain committed to cooperating fully and truthfully with this committee. All I can do is provide the facts as I understood them at the time. I did this on October 3rd in private and I will do so again today.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Like many others who have testified in this inquiry, I’m a career foreign policy professional. I began my career as an intelligence analyst for Northern Europe for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1986 before joining the state department in 1988. I served in diplomatic postings, primarily focused on European political and security issues for over 20 years under presidents: Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	My last three positions before leaving the senior foreign service in 2009 were as director for NATO in West European affairs at the National Security Council, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs at the state department, and finally, as US ambassador to NATO. In the spring of 2017 then secretary of state, Tillerson, asked if I would come back to government service as US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. I did this on a part-time, voluntary basis with no salary paid by the US taxpayer simply because I believed it was important to serve our country in this way. I believed I could steer US policy in the right direction. For over two years as US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations, my singular focus was advancing the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	In particular, that meant pushing back on Russian aggression and supporting the development of a strong, resilient, democratic and prosperous Ukraine, one that overcomes a legacy of corruption and becomes integrated into a wider transatlantic community. This is critically important for US national security. If we can stop and reverse Russian aggression in Ukraine, we can prevent it elsewhere. If Ukraine, the cradle of Slavic civilization pre-dating Moscow succeeds as a freedom, loving, prosperous, and secure democracy, it gives us enormous hope that Russia may one day change, providing a better life for Russian people and overcoming its current plague of authoritarianism, corruption, aggression toward neighbors and threats to NATO in the United States. The stakes for the United States and a successful Ukraine could not be higher.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	At no time was I aware of or knowingly took apart in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. As you know from the extensive realtime documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. I was not made aware of any reference to vice president Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25th, 2019.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	From July 7, 2017, until September 27th, 2019, I was the lead US diplomat dealing with Russia’s war on Ukraine. My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel. I reported directly to secretaries of state: Tillerson and Pompeo kept the national security advisor and secretary of defense well-informed of my efforts and worked closely with Ambassador Masha Yovanovitch, NSC Senior Director Hill, and her successor, Tim Morrison, then-Assistant Secretary Wess Mitchell and his successor acting Assistant Secretary Phil Reeker, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of defense, Laura Cooper, NSC Director Alex Vindman and many, many others. I have known many of them for several years. It was a team effort.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	When Ambassador Yovanovitch left Kyiv, I identified and recommended Bill Taylor to Secretary Pompeo, so we would still have a strong seasoned professional on the ground. For two years before the events at the heart of this investigation took place, I was the most senior US diplomat visiting the conflict zone, meeting with victims of Russia’s aggression, urging increased US security assistance, including lethal defensive weapons, working with Ukrainian President Poroshenko and then his successor President Zelensky and their teams, working with France and Germany and the so-called Norman process, pressing for support from NATO, the EU and OSCE, supporting the OSCE special monitoring mission and engaging in negotiations and other contacts with Russian officials.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	At the time I took the position in the summer of 2017, there were major complicated questions swirling in public debate about the direction of US policy towards Ukraine. Would the administration lifts sanctions against Russia? Would it make some kind of grand bargain with Russia in which it would trade recognition of Russia seizure of Ukrainian territory for some other deal in Syria or elsewhere? Would the administration recognized Russia’s claimed annexation of Crimea? Will this just become another frozen conflict?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	There are also a vast number of vacancies in key diplomatic positions, so no one was really representing the United States in the negotiating process about ending the war in Eastern Ukraine. During over two years of my tenure as US Special Representative, we fundamentally turned US policy around. US policy towards Ukraine was strong, consistent and enjoyed support across the administration, bipartisan support in Congress and support among our allies and Ukraine. We changed the language commonly used to describe Russia’s aggression.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was the administration’s most outspoken public figure highlighting Russia’s invasion and occupation of parts of Ukraine, calling out Russia’s responsibility to end the war. I visited the war zone three times, meeting with soldiers and civilians alike, always bringing media with me to try to raise the public visibility of Russia’s aggression and the humanitarian impact on the lives of the citizens of the Donbass. We coordinated closely with our European allies in Canada to maintain a United front against Russian aggression and for Ukraine’s democracy reform, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Ukraine policy is perhaps the one area where the US and its European allies had to be in, in a lockstep. This coordination help to strengthen US sanctions against Russia and to maintain EU sanctions as well. Along with others in the administration, I strongly advocated for lifting the ban on the sale of lethal defensive weapons or at least the defensive arms to Ukraine, advocated for increasing US security assistance to Ukraine and urged other countries to follow suit. My team and I drafted the Pompeo declaration of July 25th, 2018 in which the secretary clearly and definitively laid out the US policy of non-recognition of Russia’s claimed annexation of Crimea.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I engage with our allies, with Ukraine, and with Russia in negotiations to implement the Minsk agreements, holding a firm line on insisting on the withdrawal of Russian forces dismantling of the so-called people’s republics and restoring Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Together with others in the administration, we kept US policy steady through presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine and worked hard to strengthen the US-Ukraine bilateral relationship under the new president and government, helping shepherd in a peaceful transition of power in Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	So in short, whereas two years ago, most observers would have said that time is on Russia’s side, by 2019 when I departed, we had turned the tables and time was now on Ukraine’s side. It’s a tragedy for the United States and for Ukraine that our efforts in this area, which were bearing fruit, have now been thrown into disarray. One of the critical aspects of my role as US Special Representative was that, as the most senior US official appointed to work solely on the Ukraine portfolio, I needed to step forward to provide leadership. If we needed to adopt a policy position, I made the case for it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	If anyone needed to speak out publicly, I would do it. When we failed to get a timely statement about Russia’s illegal attack on Ukraine’s Navy and seizure of Ukraine sailors, I tweeted about it in order to condemn the act. If a problem arose, I knew it was my job to try to fix it. That was my perspective when I learned in May 2019, that we had a significant problem that was impeding our ability to strengthen our support for Ukraine’s new president in his effort to ramp up Ukraine’s fight against corruption and implementation of needed reforms.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I found myself faced with the choice to be aware of a problem and to ignore it or to accept that it was my responsibility to try to fix it. I tried to fix it. The problem was that despite the unanimous positive assessment and recommendations of those of us who were part of the US presidential delegation that attended the inauguration of President Zelensky, President Trump was receiving a different negative narrative about Ukraine and President Zelensky. That narrative was fueled by accusations from Ukraine’s then prosecutor general and conveyed to the president by former mayor, Rudy Giuliani.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	As I previously told this committee, I became aware of the negative impact this was having on our policy efforts when four of us, who were a part of the presidential delegation to the inauguration, met as a group with President Trump on May 23rd. We stressed our finding that President Zelensky represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out of the mire of corruption that had been in for over 20 years. We urged him to invite President Zelensky to the White House. The president was very skeptical. Given Ukraine’s history of corruption, that’s understandable.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country full of terrible people. He said, “They tried to take me down.” In the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor Giuliani. It was clear to me that despite the positive news and recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation about the new president, President Trump had a deeply rooted negative view on your grain rooted in the past. He was receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Within a few days, on May 29th, President Trump indeed signed the congratulatory letter to President Zelensky, which included an invitation to the president to visit him at the White House. However, more than four weeks passed and we could not nail down a date for the meeting. I came to believe that the president’s long-held negative view towards Ukraine was causing hesitation in actually scheduling the meeting much as we had seen in our Oval Office discussion.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	After weeks of reassuring the Ukrainians that it was just a scheduling issue, I decided to tell President Zelensky that we had a problem with the information reaching President Trump from Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a bilateral meeting at a conference on Ukrainian economic reform in Toronto on July 2nd, 2019 where I led the US delegation. I suggested that he called President Trump directly in order to renew their personal relationship and to assure President Trump that he was committed to investigating and fighting corruption, things on which President Zelensky had based his presidential campaign. I was convinced that getting the two presidents to talk with each other would overcome the negative perception of Ukraine that President Trump still harbored. President Zelensky senior aid, Andriy Yermak, approached me several days later to ask to be connected to Mayor Giuliani. I agreed to make that connection. I did so because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those, like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine that times have changed and that, under President Zelensky, Ukraine is worthy of US support.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Ukrainians believed that if they could get their own narrative across in a way that convinced Mayor Giuliani that they were serious about fighting corruption and advancing reform, Mayor Giuliani would convey that assessment to President Trump thus correcting the previous negative narrative. That made sense to me and I tried to be helpful. I made clear to the Ukrainians that Mayor Giuliani was a private citizen, the president’s personal lawyer and not representing the US government.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Likewise, in my conversations with Mayor Giuliani, I never considered him to be speaking on the president’s behalf or giving instructions, rather, the information flow was the other way, from Ukraine to Mayor Giuliani in the hopes that this would clear up the information reaching President Trump. On July 10th after hearing from Mr. Yermak, I wrote to Mayor Giuliani to seek to get together and finally on July 19th, we met for breakfast for a longer discussion.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	At that meeting, I told Mr. Giuliani that in my view, the prosecutor general with whom he had been speaking, Mr. Lutsenko, was not credible and was acting in a self-serving capacity. To my surprise, Mayor Giuliani said that he had already come to that same conclusion. Mr. Giuliani also mentioned both the accusations about Vice President Biden and about interference in the 2016 election and stressed that all he wanted to see was for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	… for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws. Concerning the allegations, I stress that no one in the new team governing Ukraine had anything to do with anything that may have happened in 2016. They were making television shows at the time. I also said that it’s not credible to me that former Vice President Biden would have been influenced in any way by financial or personal motives in carrying out his duties as vice president. A different issue is whether some individual Ukrainians may have attempted to influence the 2016 election or thought they could buy influence. That is at least plausible given Ukraine’s reputation for corruption, but the accusation that Vice President Biden acted inappropriately did not seem at all credible to me. After that meeting, I connected Mayor Giuliani and Mr. Yermak by text and later by phone. They met in person on August 2nd, 2019.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	In conversations with me following that meeting, which I did not attend, Mr. Giuliani said that he had stressed the importance of Ukraine conducting investigations into what happened in the past and Mr. Yermak stressed that he told Mr. Giuliani it is the government’s program to root out corruption and implement reforms and they would be conducting investigations as part of this process anyway. Mr. Giuliani said he believed the Ukrainian president needed to make a statement about fighting corruption and that he had discussed this with Mr. Yermak. I said, I did not think that this would be a problem since that is the government’s position anyway. I followed up with Mr. Yermak and he said that they would indeed be prepared to make a statement. He said it would reference Burisma and 2016 in a wider context of bilateral relations and rooting out corruption anyway. There was no mention of Vice President Biden. Rather in referencing Burisma and 2016 election interference, it was clear to me that he, Mr. Yermak, was only talking about whether any Ukrainians had acted inappropriately.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	At this time I was focused on our goal of getting President Zelensky and President Trump to meet with each other and I believe that their doing so would overcome the chronically negative view President Trump had towards Ukraine. I was seeking to solve the problem I saw when we met with President Trump in the Oval Office on May 23rd. As a professional diplomat, I was comfortable exploring whether there was a statement Ukraine could make about its own intentions to investigate possible corruption that would be helpful in convincing Mr. Giuliani to convey to President Trump a more positive assessment of the new leadership in Ukraine. On August 16th, Mr. Yermak shared a draft with me, which I thought looked perfectly reasonable. It did not mention Burisma or 2016 elections but was generic. Ambassador Sondland and I had a further conversation with Mr. Giuliani, who said in his view, in order to be convincing that this government represented real change in Ukraine, the statement should include specific reference to Burisma and 2016. Again, there was no mention of Vice President Biden to these conversations.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Ambassador Sondland and I discussed these points and I edited the statement drafted by Mr. Yermak to include these points to see how it looked. I then discussed it further with Mr. Yermak. He said that for a number of reasons, including the fact that Mr. Lutsenko was still officially the prosecutor general, they did not want to mention Burisma or 2016. I agreed and the idea of putting out a statement was shelved. These were the last conversations I had about this statement, which were on or about August 17 to 18. My last contact with Mr. Giuliani according to my records was on August 13th, until he tried to reach me on September 20th after the impeachment inquiry was launched. At this time, that is to say in the middle of August, I thought the idea of issuing this statement had been definitively scrapped. In September. I was surprised to learn that there had been further discussions with Ukrainians about President Zelensky possibly making a statement in an interview with U.S. media similar to what we had discussed in August
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Since these events and since I gave my testimony on October 3rd, a great deal of additional information and perspectives have come to light. I’ve learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question. First, at the time I was connecting Mr. Yermak and Mr. Giuliani and discussing with Mr. Yermak and Ambassador Sondland a possible statement that could be made by the Ukrainian president, I did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations. No one had ever said that to me and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians. I oppose the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18th and I thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it. I did not know the reason for the hold, but I viewed it as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally and I was confident we would do so.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe the Ukrainians became aware of the hold on August 29th and not before. That date is the first time any of them asked me about the hold by forwarding an article that had been published in Politico. When I spoke to the Ukrainians about the hold after August 29th, instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite, that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem and we were working to get it fixed. I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around the same time. Second, I did not know about the strong concerns expressed by then national Security Advisor, John Bolton to members of his NSC staff regarding the discussion of investigations. I participated in the July 10th meeting between National Security Advisor Bolton and then Ukrainian chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Alex Danylyuk.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	As I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about investigations. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate. The conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded. Later on in the Ward Room. I may have been engaged in a side conversation or had already left the complex because I do not recall further discussion regarding investigations or Burisma. Third, I did not understand that others believe that any investigation of Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a sharp distinction between the two. It has long been U.S. policy under multiple administrations to urge Ukraine to investigate and fight internal corruption. I was quite comfortable with Ukraine making its own statement about its own policy of investigating and fighting corruption at home. At the one in person meeting I had with Mayor Giuliani on July 19th, Mayor Giuliani raised and I rejected the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	As I previously testified, I have known Vice President Biden for 24 years, he is an honorable man and I hold him in the highest regard. At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. And as you know from the extensive documentation I provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of discussion. I was not on the July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25th, 2019. Throughout this time, I understood that there was an important distinction between Burisma and Biden and I urge the Ukrainians to maintain such a distinction. I did not know that President Trump or others had raised Vice President Biden with Ukrainians or had conflated the investigation of possible Ukrainian corruption with investigation of the former vice president.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	In retrospect, for the Ukrainians, it would clearly have been confusing. In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company, Burisma, as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different, the former being appropriate and unremarkable. The latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, I should’ve seen that connection differently and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections. Fourth, much has been made of the term, “three amigos” in reference to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland and myself. I’ve never used that term and frankly cringe when I hear it because for me, the “three amigos” will always refer to Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman and Senator Graham in reference to their work to support the surge in Iraq. Moreover, I was never aware of any designation by President Trump or anyone else putting Ambassador Sondland or the three of us as a group in charge of Ukraine policy.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Rather, as I understood it, each of us in our own respective official capacities continued to work together after our attendance of President Zelensky’s inauguration to push for greater U.S. support for Ukraine. Leading the diplomacy around Ukraine negotiations have long been my official responsibility, but I welcomed the added support and influence of a cabinet member and our EU ambassador. Fifth, I was not aware that Ambassador Sondland spoke with President Trump on July 26th, while Ambassador Taylor and I were visiting the conflict zone. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, allow me to thank you again for the opportunity to provide this testimony. I believe that U.S. foreign policy and national security interest in Ukraine are of critical importance and I’d be pleased to answer your questions. Thank you.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First off, the allegations themselves, including those against Ambassador Yovanovitch did not appear to me to be credible at all. I know her to be an incredibly competent professional. Someone I’ve worked with for many, many years. The suggestions that she was acting in some inappropriate manner were not credible to me. I’ve known Vice President Biden for a long time. Those accusations were not credible. And then separate from that, I also was aware of the political situation in Ukraine. We had a situation where President Poroshenko appeared to not be in a favorable position going into the elections. Where it was increasingly apparent then candidate Zelensky was going to win. As is often the case in Ukraine, a change in power would mean change in prosecutorial powers as well. And there have been efforts in the past at prosecuting the previous government.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I think Mr. Lutsenko in my estimation, and I said this to Mayor Giuliani when I met with him, was interested in preserving his own position. He wanted to avoid being fired by a new government in order to prevent prosecution of himself, possible prosecution of himself. Possibly also this is something that President Poroshenko would’ve welcomed as well because he probably would have avoided any efforts to prosecute President Poroshenko as well. So by making allegations like this and making sure they were reaching U.S. media, I think that Mr. Lutsenko was trying to make himself appear to be an important and influential player in the United States.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Simply because I’ve known Vice President, former Vice President Biden for a long time. I know how he respects his duties of higher office and it’s just not credible to me that a Vice President of the United States is going to do anything other than act as how he sees best for the national interest.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah. That others did not see the distinction between these things as I saw it. As I said, there is a history of corruption in Ukraine. There’s a history with the company of Burisma that’s been investigated. That is well known. There is a separate allegation about the vice president acting inappropriately. His son was a board member of this company, but those things I saw as completely distinct .and what I was trying to do in working with Ukrainians was to thread a needle to see whether things that they can do that are appropriate and reasonable as part of Ukraine’s own policy of fighting corruption. That helped clarify for our President that are committed to that very effort. If there’s a way to thread that needle, I thought it was worth the effort to try to solve that problem. As it turns out, I now understand that most of the other people didn’t see or didn’t consider this distinction, that for them it was synonymous.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I would’ve objected to that, yes sir.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well I believe that they were separate. And this references the conversation I had with Mr. Giuliani as well, where I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible. Separate question is whether it is appropriate for Ukraine to investigate possible corruption of Ukrainians that may have tried to corrupt things or buy influence. To me they are very different things and as I said, I think the former is unacceptable, I think the latter in this case [crosstalk 00:51:39]
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I knew that he had been a board member of the company, yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s why it was so important to maintain a distinction.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. So I say, “Hi Gordon. Got your message. Had a great lunch with Yermak and then passed your message to him. He will see you tomorrow. Think everything is in place.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Andre Yermak is the senior advisor to President Zelensky of Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That President Zelensky should be clear, convincing, forthright with President Trump about his commitment to fighting corruption, investigating what happened in the past, get to the bottom of things, whatever there is. And if he does that, President Trump was prepared to be reassured that he would say, “Yes, come on, let’s get this date for this visit scheduled.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I wasn’t sure whether he had or not. He, as Mr. Morrison just said, said that he does speak with President Trump. I knew that he had conversations in general. I didn’t know specifically about one leading up to this.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I believe because of the time difference. This is actually in the afternoon in Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Right-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. And just after the lunch that I had with Andre Yermak. Says, “Good lunch, thanks. Heard from White House, assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate, get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck. See you tomorrow, Kurt.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Sir, I don’t recall that language from my testimony, it’s from my October 3rd testimony?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you. Well, what I do mean by that, and I’d like to phrase it in my own words now, is I don’t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are sort of, they’re not things that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine. We should be supporting Ukraine’s democracy, reforms, its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing and I don’t think pursuing these things serves a national interest.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I didn’t take it as an instruction, I want to be clear about that. He said, “That’s not what I hear.” When we were giving him our assessment about President Zelensky and where Ukraine is headed, “That’s not what I hear. I are terrible things. He’s got terrible people around him, talk to Rudy.” And I understood in that context, him just saying, that’s where he hears it from. I didn’t take it as an instruction.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I didn’t take it that way. I took it as, just part of the dialogue that “I hear other things, I hear them from Rudy Giuliani or other people. That’s not what’s going on. He’s surrounded by terrible people. Talk to Rudy.” It just seemed like part of the dialogue.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	After that meeting not immediately, no. Remember this was May 23rd and we continued to proceed with our effort to get the White House visit for President Zelensky scheduled and to keep ramping up our support for the new Ukrainian president, and ultimately the new Ukrainian government. I did, however, on July 2nd as I was becoming concerned that we were not succeeding at this, to tell President Zelensky, “I think we have a problem.” And that problem being this negative feed of information from Mr. Giuliani.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I think that he felt that he was not well understood by President Trump. He is a charismatic leader who ran a remarkable campaign in Ukraine against the legacy of corruption and political mullahs that had been there. He had a massive showing in the presidential election, 73% support. He believed he was leading a movement of major change in Ukraine, and that President Trump did not see that or didn’t appreciate that. But if he had a chance to sit down and speak with President Trump face to face, he believed that he could be very convincing about that and I agree with him.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It was my assessment, and I believe it was also what President Zelensky believed.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, that is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	They met in Madrid.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Madrid.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Only when I spoke with Mr. Giuliani afterwards, he said that he thought Ukraine should issue a statement. And then I spoke with Mr. Yermak after that, and he said yes and we are prepared to make a statement. And that then kicked off the series of discussions that I said in my testimony.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	He said something more general, as I recall. I recall him saying fight corruption, that their commitment to being different. Mr. Yermak told me when I spoke with him, as I recall, that the statement would include specific mention of Burisma and 2016.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I said excellent with two exclamation points. How did you sway him with a smile afterwards?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	But how does he know that?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Agree.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It relates to the statement that he and Mr. Yermak had discussed.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Right. I wrote, I agree with your approach. Let’s iron out statement and use that to get date and then President Zelensky can go forward with it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Sounds great.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	This is the first draft of that from Mr. Yermak after the conversations that we had.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It does not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is the same Mr. Giuliani.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I knew that he had adopted or was interested in all of those conspiracy theories that had come from Lutsenko.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Back in May.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, now what do we mean by these investigations?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Burisma and 2016, yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I didn’t find it that unusual. I think when you’re dealing with a situation where I believe the president was highly skeptical about President Zelensky being committed to really changing Ukraine after his entirely negative view of the country, that he would want to hear something more from President Zelensky to be convinced that, okay, I’ll give this guy a chance.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, again, when we say these investigations, what I understood us to be talking about was Ukrainian corruption.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	The way I saw it is that it would be helpful. It would be a way of being convincing to Mayor Giuliani and also the president that this team in Ukraine is serious about fighting corruption reform, that they are different. And if that would be helpful in getting a more positive attitude and the White House meeting scheduled, then that would be useful.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I wouldn’t have called it a necessary condition. And in fact, when it became clear later that we were not able to agree on an agreement that the Ukrainians were comfortable with, I agree with the Ukrainians just to drop it. It’s not worth it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I wouldn’t have called it a condition. It’s a nuance I guess, but I viewed it as very helpful. If we could get this done, it would help improve the perception that President Trump and others had, and then we would get the date for a meeting. If we didn’t have a statement, I wasn’t giving up and thinking that, oh well then we’ll never get a meeting.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It says, “Hi Andrey. Good talking. Following is text with insert at the end for the two key items. We will work on official request.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s what he said will be necessary for that to be credible.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Not yet.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you. I do remember a conversation with Tim. I’m not sure about the timing. I left around that time to go on a trip, and so it may have been a little bit earlier. I’m not sure about the timing. And what I do remember the discussion being is Tim asking me what is my impression of the role that Ambassador Sondland plays. And my response to that was, well, I find it helpful that he has political contacts in the White House. I don’t have those contacts. I’m working the national security, the diplomatic front, but I don’t have the political contacts. And so he’s able to use those to support the same goals that we are working toward. And I viewed that as helpful.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I say, I’m not in the loop. Talk Monday.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s my understanding.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No sir.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Very proud of it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was the principal deputy assistant secretary, so I had all, working for the assistant secretary, had all of Europe and Eurasia and particular responsibility for NATO, Western Europe and European Union.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was acting for several months, six months or so.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I did.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Not for me to say.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Absolutely. When I look back at the record, I think we did an awful lot to support Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	President Trump approved each of the decisions made along the way. Providing lethal defensive equipment and the non-recognition statement on Crimea, I think being two of the most important ones.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe it was. I can’t be 100% sure, but I believe it was the largest national delegation.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland, myself, Senator Ron Johnson was there, and also the charge aid affair at the US embassy at the time, Joe Pennington.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It did. I believe we had about three days notice in which to put the delegation together.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is true.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, it’s something that had happened in my career in the past. I’d seen holdups of assistance. I just assumed it was part of the decision making process. Somebody had an objection. We had to overcome it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That was a supposition that I made because of the meeting with the president on May 23rd. I thought that could be what’s behind it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe he, let me get the dates straight. I believe, yes. He was able to convene the parliament around the 1st of September, and I believe the aid was released on the 11th of September.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That began with the parliament seated on that day. It was a 24 hour session, but then it continued for some time.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It started off in a very encouraging way. Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Can you repeat the question? I’m sorry.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. In September of 2017, I was invited by Secretary Tillerson to do a pre-brief with President Trump before his meeting with President Poroshenko on the margins of the UN general assembly. I did the pre-brief and then I took part in the bilateral meeting.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, he had a very strongly negative view.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. I want to be very careful here because this was a bilateral meeting between the two presidents. I don’t want to stray into classified material. But I can tell you my impression was that he had a very strongly negative view of Ukraine at the time.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. The president came into the meeting and immediately started speaking. He had just a string of comments that Ukraine is a terrible place. They’re all corrupt. They’re terrible people. They tried to take me down. I tried to explain along with the others that were there. Each of us took turns speaking. I tried to explain that President Zelensky agrees with you, that he was elected because of that situation in Ukraine. And he has a strong mandate from the people of Ukraine to change it. And that’s why it’s important that we actually show him very strong support now. But the president was not convinced, and he said that Zelinsky is no different, that he has terrible people around him. It’s not what I hear about Ukraine, what we’re telling him. I hear that nothing has changed. Talk to Rudy, that kind of dialogue as I described.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did. I believed that he was referring to the rumors of efforts to interfere in the 2016 election by providing damaging information about the president or about Paul Manafort to the Hillary Clinton campaign. That was one of the rumors that had been been out there and that had gotten some support from the Ukrainian prosecutor general.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe he was concerned about it. I don’t know what he actually believed, but he brought it up.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, it is.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct. I received a text message, from one of my Ukrainian counterparts, on August 29th, forwarding that article, and that’s the first they raised it with me.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. I didn’t have any communications with the Ukrainians about the hold on aid until after they raised it with me, for the same reason that Tim just gave, on the hope that we could get it taken care of ourselves, before it became something that they became aware of. Inside the U.S. government, I was aware that the hold was placed. I was aware of that on July 18th. It was referenced at an inter agency meeting, and I got a read out from that meeting, from one of my assistants.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I, then, immediately spoke with several people in the administration, to object. I thought that this was a bad decision, or a bad hold, maybe not a decision, but a process. I wanted to make sure that all the arguments were marshaled, to get it lifted. So, I spoke with the Pentagon, [inaudible 01:50:14] Cooper, I spoke with Assistant Secretary of [inaudible 01:50:17] affairs at the state department, who was going to represent the state department at the next higher level meeting. I believe I spoke with officials in European Bureau, with the national security council staff. So, I was actively trying to convey that this needed to be lifted and I wanted them to be able to use my name in doing so, because I felt that the best prospect for positioning ourselves for negotiations with Russia, is the strongest defense capability for Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, thank you. I can only tell you what I know. There may have been other conversations, or other things, but I know that we had a conversation, Bill Taylor, and I believe Gordon Sondland, and I, around the 28th of June. That later connected to, I believe, a conversation with President Zelensky, although I may not have been part of the latter. That being said, I was convinced after that conversation we had gotten nowhere. We had our White House briefing of President Trump, on May 23rd. He signed a letter inviting President Zelensky to the White House on May 29th, and for several weeks, we were just temporizing with Ukrainians, saying, “Well, we’re working on it. It’s a scheduling issue. We’ll get there, don’t worry.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I told Bill, and Gordon, that I was going to see President Zelensky in Toronto, and I feel an obligation to tell him the truth. That we have a problem here, we’re not getting a date scheduled, here’s what I think the problem is. It’s the negative information flow from Mayor Giuliani. Also, that I would advise him that he should call President Trump personally, because he needed to renew that personal relationship, and be able to convey to President Trump that he was serious about fighting corruption, investigating things that happened in the past and so forth. So, I did all of that with President Zelensky in a [inaudible 00:07:50], after our formal bilateral meeting.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I believe so.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Not at that time. I think later on, these things came up, about when we were talking about a statement. Whether there were investigations, but I believe at this time in Toronto, it was really more referring to investigations generically, that that is how you go about fighting corruption, and that President Zelensky should reaffirm his commitment to President Trump in a direct phone call.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Not at that time.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you. Let me answer that question first. I’d like to come back to your prior question for a second, too, if I may, but on the July 10th meeting, this was a meeting that we had arranged between Alex Danyliuk, who was the head of the National Security and Defense Council, and the National Security Advisor Bolton. Attending the meeting was also Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland, myself, I believe Fiona Hill, and also Andriy Yermak. The purpose was really a counterpart visit. I thought that this would be the best opportunity, it was the first high level meeting that we were having in Washington, with a senior U.S. official, Ambassador Bolton after President Zelensky’s inauguration. I thought it’d be a great opportunity for the Ukrainians to make their case, that they are the new team in town. Real deal about fighting corruption. I was rather disappointed with the meeting. As it transpired, it struck me as down in the weeds, talking about a reform of national security structures in Ukraine, legislation that they were working on, and not the big picture and not the bilateral relationship. So, I was a bit disappointed by that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	At the end of the meeting, I do recall, having seen some of the other testimony, I believe in Ambassador Sondland did raise the point of investigations, in a generic way. This was after the meeting was already wrapping up, and I think all of us thought it was inappropriate, and the conversation did not pick up from there. The meeting was over. We all went outside, and we had a picture taken in front of the White House, and then all of us except Ambassador Bolton, went down to the wardroom to talk through followup. About, “Well, how do we follow up on this meeting, to keep the momentum in the relationship?” I think we broke up into several small groups. I remember having a conversation with Secretary Perry, and one of his assistants, about energy reform as part of that. I don’t recall other conversations following up on investigations, or Burisma.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, no. Again, the issue of the security assistance was one where I thought that this was really related to a general negative view about Ukraine. There was nothing specific ever communicated to me about it, or the reasons why it was held. We certainly didn’t want to talk about it with the Ukrainians. We wanted to fix it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I was actually already on my way to Ukraine, I think two days prior to that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. So, I was not on the phone call. I had arrived in Ukraine, and I had had that lunch with Mr. Yermak that we saw on the day of the phone call. I had been pushing for the phone call, because I thought it was important to renew the personal connection between the two leaders, and to congratulate President Zelensky on the parliamentary election. The readout that I received from Mr. Yermak, and then also from the U.S. side, although I’m not exactly sure who it was from on the U.S. side, but there was a U.S. and a Ukrainian readout, were largely the same. That it was a good call, it was a congratulatory phone call for the President’s win in the parliamentary election. President Zelensky did reiterate his commitment to reform, and fighting corruption in Ukraine, and President Trump did reiterate his invitation to President Zelensky to come visit him in the White House. That’s exactly what I thought the phone call would be, so I was not surprised at getting that as the readout.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	At that time. We were together, in Ukraine, at that time. We went the very next day to visit the conflict zone, and I’m sure he heard the same readout that I did.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, we had a meeting the day after the phone call, on the 26th. In the morning, before heading out to the conflict zone.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, only the very bare bones readout that I had received. That was also how it was discussed in the meeting with President Zelensky.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t recall that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I do not recall being… Well, let me turn that around, and say he was very positive about the phone call.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t recall him saying anything about demands, but he was very upbeat about the fact of the call.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t recall that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t remember that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I’ve only seen an allegation of bribery in the last week.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was never involved in anything that I considered to be bribery at all.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Or extortion.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Mr. Castor, may I address two specific points?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	One is I’m reminded that the meeting with Ambassador Bolton, and Mr. Danyliuk, took place on July 10th.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did not become aware of the hold on security assistance until July 18th.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	So, that is another reason why that did not come up.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did not. No, I heard about it for the first time on the 18th of July.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	May I make a second observation as well?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I do remember, having seen some of the testimony of Mr. Kent, a conversation in which he had asked me about the conspiracy theories that were out there, in Ukraine. I don’t remember what the date of this conversation was, and my view was, “Well, if there are things like that, then why not investigate them?” [inaudible 02:01:01], I don’t believe that there’s anything to them. If there is, the 2016 election interference is what I was thinking of, we would want to know about that, but I didn’t really believe there’s anything there to begin with.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct. That has been U.S. policy for years.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, that, I think, is the plausible thing to look at there. As I said, I don’t find it plausible, or credible, that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties, but whether individual Ukrainians in the society that we know Ukraine has been for decades, were trying to act in a corrupt way, or to buy influence, that’s plausible.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was aware of those kinds of things. I couldn’t give you those kinds of details. I just know that there was a reputation around the company.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s what I understand.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, I can’t speculate as to any of the specifics of what was motivating Burisma, or not. Ukrainian government authorities investigating possible corruption by Ukrainian citizens is a perfectly appropriate thing for them to do.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Only as you saw reflected in the text messages themselves, where he said, “Is this now a linkage, or are we doing this?” He had a concern about, just in general, Rudy Giuliani, which I think a lot of us had, but the issue is what do you do about it, about the role that he’s playing. As you note, we were in frequent contact, near daily contact throughout this entire period.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	We were on many one-on-one telephone calls. He did not raise those concerns that way. No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, he did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, and I don’t agree with his characterization of that, because I had been in my role for a couple of years. I had been the lead on U.S. Ukraine negotiations, and negotiating with Russia and the inter agency work, and the work with our allies. We have a Secretary of Energy, who is a cabinet official, and I think having support from various U.S. Officials for our strengthening, our engagement with Ukraine, I viewed as a very positive thing. If the concern is not us so much, then, because we’re all U.S. officials, but Mayor Giuliani, I don’t view that as a channel at all, because he’s not a representative of the U.S. government, he’s a private citizen. I viewed him as perhaps a useful barometer, in understanding what may be helpful communication from the Ukrainian government, but not someone in a position to represent the U.S. government at all.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. I received a readout from both Ukrainian colleague, Andrey Yermak, as well as from a US person. I don’t now remember whether it was my staffer or someone from the embassy or where. And the readout was that it was a good phone call. That it was a congratulatory phone call for the President’s win in the parliamentary election. That Presidents Zelensky did reiterate his commitment to fighting corruption and advancing reform in Ukraine. And that President Trump renewed his invitation for President Zelensky to come to the White House.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Exactly. That’s what we were trying to tee up.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah, I expected that President Zelensky would be convincing in his statements and comments with President Trump. That he was exactly that, that he would investigate, get to the bottom of things that had happened in 2016. And that if he was strong and conveying who he is as a person and doing that, that President Trump would be convinced and renew the invitation to the White House.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	This is… I paraphrase-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	The word corruption is not there. Investigating things that have happened in the past that would be corrupt, would be investigating corruption.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah, the subject of the investigation are things that happened in the past.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	On the 26th, we had a meeting with President Zelensky, yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah, I don’t recall them coming up. Just the general phone call.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No I did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I have no reason to doubt their notes if they were notes taken contemporaneously at the meeting.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes I did. I did mention that I had been making the rounds to weigh in on lifting the hold on security assistance. To do that with all of the inter agency players.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Not exactly.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I recall talking about the statement that we had discussed earlier, the one that had been in the subject of these exchanges between Mr. Yermak and myself. Myself, Ambassador Sondland and Rudy Giuliani. And then back to Yermak. So I discussed that this is an effort we are doing. That this could be helpful in getting a reset of the thinking of the President, the negative view of Ukraine that he had. And if we did that, I thought that would also be helpful, in unblocking whatever hold there was on security assistance. And if there’s this negative presumption about Ukraine, getting this stuff on track would be helpful.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe she accurately reflected what she understood from the conversation.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t believe so.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah, I am pretty sure that Deputy Assistant Secretary kent was not on it. I don’t remember whether Secretary Perry was on it. And I don’t remember whether I stayed on for Presidents Zelensky joining the call or not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	There were two separate calls or the same call.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t believe so.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	We were having a call among ourselves to talk about what were the messages we thought we needed to convey.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I recall seeing that in Ambassador Taylor’s testimony, and I believe there may have even been a text message to that effect. And again, it comes down to what are we talking about in terms of these investigations? Because what I certainly understood is we’re talking about Ukraine looking into and fighting corruption internally. And being convincing about this, presenting the new president and the new team as a change in Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It’s correct that I learned about the President’s interest in investigating Vice President Biden from the phone call transcript, which came much, much later. From Giuliani, I didn’t know that he was actively pursuing this. I did know that he raised this with me directly, and I had pushed back on it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Again, he didn’t specify Biden. He didn’t specify Burisma as I recall either. I understood it to be a generic comment. And something again, not appropriate for that meeting.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, that’s what I understand.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Can you repeat the question? I didn’t catch that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That I’m not sure about. I remember the meeting essentially already being over, and then Ambassador Sondland bringing that up.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was thinking of Burisma in 2016.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t know specifically that time if we had talked to that specifically Burisma 2016 with President Zelensky. That was my assumption though, that they would have been thinking that too.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I am familiar with that testimony.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I do. I was repeating what Gordon Sondland had said to me, to explain to Bill Taylor, what that understanding was.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I think we were talking about the release of the hold on security assistance. And he was saying that the President has, he’s already got a negative view of Ukraine. He sees a check on his desk that’s going to the Ukrainians, not sure about them. So he wants to hold onto it until he’s assured.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That was not clear to me.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I didn’t think that there was a pay up as you say. As we said, the language was similar. I had heard from Gordon that he sees this check, he’s not sure he wants it. He wants to make sure that he’s got a deal with the Ukrainians. I didn’t know specifically other than this, that generic formulation.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I saw that statement, yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I do.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Not about investigations with him. I believe I kept that discussion to being with Mr. Yermak. And we did discuss with Foreign Minister Prystaiko, and at the time he was diplomatic advisor security assistance, after it was raised, after August 29th. And I did discuss that with him.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I can’t say whether he did or didn’t. We were in frequent contact and we were just talking about the issues as we went along.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did not get any things specific after that. This was around I believe September 1st or second. And it was at that time that I had been, I think texted by Mr. Yermak, and was subsequent in touch with him and Prystaiko, where I told them both. And also the Defense Minister. I told them all, don’t worry, we know about this. We were trying to fix it. And I think I left the conversation at that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Very much so. We had a very close relationship.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I think they believe me. I think they would also have other conversations, and they would hear things from other people. But I also think that they knew I was sincere with them.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. Between, I guess it was the 10th of July and around the 13th of August.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t believe he did, but I don’t know.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is true.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It’s only those specific instances.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t know what he thought.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Because that’s what I remembered from the meeting, what I provided in my October 3rd statement. As I said, I’ve learned other things, including seeing the statements from Alex Vindman and from Fiona Hill. And that reminded me that yes, at the very end of that meeting, as it was recounted in Colonel Vindman’s statement, I did remember that. Yes, that’s right. Gordon did bring that up, and that was it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Right, so in terms of Gordon bringing it up, no, I did not remember that at the time of my October 3rd testimony. I read the account by Alex, and that jogged my memory. I said yes, that’s right. That did happen. I do not, still to this point, recall it being an abrupt end to the meeting. The meeting was essentially over. And we got up, we went out to the little circle in front of the White House. We took a photograph. It did not strike me as abrupt.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah I thought it was some… Put it this way, it’s something of an eye roll moment, where you have a meeting, you’re trying to advance the substance of the bilateral relationship. We have the head of the National Security and Defense Council. It was a disappointing meeting because I don’t think that the Ukrainians got as much out of that in terms of their presentation as they could have. And then this comes up at the very end of the meeting. It’s like, this is not what we should be talking about.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah, because it was not the place or the time to bring up that. This was a meeting between the National Security Advisor and the Chairman of the National Security Defense Council. First high level meeting we’re having between Ukraine and the United States after President Zelensky’s election.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Possibly, although I don’t recall that being… I know this was the counsel’s question. I don’t remember the exact context of when that came up. I viewed the meeting as essentially having ended.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	To investigate the Vice President of the United States or someone who was a US official. I don’t think we should be asking foreign governments to do that. I would also say that’s true of a political rival.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I have not seen that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, that’s right.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	A very big difference.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, he did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, they did not know.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was appointed by the Secretary of State, Secretary Tillerson in July of 2017 to be the US Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. That’s a role that’s different from Assistant Secretary of State or different from ambassador in Ukraine. That role is particularly focused on the diplomatic activities surrounding the efforts to reverse Russia’s invasion and occupation of Ukraine. It is Minsk Agreement implementation. It is the Normandy process with France and Germany. It is support from NATO. It is support for sanctions from the European union. It’s the OSCE and the monitoring missions. It is the efforts of individual allies like Poland, like the UK, like Canada that are supporting Ukraine. It is work at a senior level in the inner agency with Secretary of Defense.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No. Yeah. Everything I heard from Giuliani I took to be his opinion.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I have no reason to think that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. Also because the EU sanctions on Ukraine are incredibly important.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	It is the reference to Vice President Biden.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Not at all.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, it would.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I would not say that the Ukrainians are inept.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I had a bilateral meeting between the US and Ukrainian delegations, and then a policy meeting with the president and his chief of staff.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I conveyed he was repeating a negative narrative about Ukraine based on accusations of the then Prosecutor General Lutsenko.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, no. That they were negative views.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I’m sorry. I’ve lost the question, if you could repeat.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	So the Prosecutor General of Ukraine was putting out this series of conspiracy theories that I believe were self-serving and inaccurate. Mr Giuliani had repeated these to me, so I believe that he was at least affected by those and believed those and was concerned about those.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Believed that they were negative, and was conveying them to the president.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, the whole thing was problematic.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t believe I said the words cooperate on investigations.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe I did, yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I meant Burisma in 2016 was in my mind, but I wanted to keep it general, and that Ukraine in being convincing to Giuliani, and hopefully also to the president that they are serious about fighting corruption would engage in whatever investigations necessary to clean up the country.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is an accurate text message.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Contact with the actual government of Ukraine, the people who are now representing President Zelensky and his team.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	US policy toward Ukraine was about fighting corruption, and Ukraine going after that-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, wait.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	In order to fight corruption, you need to conduct investigations. You need to see what Ukrainian citizens have been up to and doing.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, first off, we have to be clear what we’re talking about in terms of investigations. We’re not talking about Vice President Biden. We’re not talking about some of the-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I’m saying that whether Ukrainians, within the company of Burisma had acted in a corrupt way, or sought to buy influence, that’s a legitimate thing for Ukraine to investigate. And if Ukraine can make a statement about their intentions on fighting corruption domestically, that is helpful in order to convince President Trump ultimately that this is-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes. You said that in your testimony as well, and the reason he’s skeptical is, let’s be honest, the guy doesn’t like foreign aid, right?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	The dollars were released.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you. I understood the deliverable to be the statement that we have been talking about.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Because the idea of the statement had come up from Mr. Yermak’s meeting with Mr. Giuliani. Remember that Mr. Yermak asked me to connect him with Mr. Giuliani. I did. They had a meeting, and then they both called me afterwards. Mr. Giuliani said that he thought Ukraine should make a statement about fighting corruption. Mr Yermak said, and we will say also specifically Burisma in 2016, Mr. Yermak provided me a draft statement, and I wanted to be assured that this statement would actually correct the perception that Mr. Giuliani had of Ukraine, and what they stand for now, so that that would also be conveyed to President Trump and solve this problem that I had observed with our May 23rd meeting with the president. The problem being, that he’s getting a bad set of information, statement like this could potentially correct that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, he was not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	He believed that it needed to say Burisma and 2016 specifically, or else it would not be credible, would not mean anything new.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, as you see, I had just had a conversation with Mr. Yarmak to describe to him the conversation that we had just had with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani said that it would need to include these things for it to be convincing to him. I put them in, so we understood what he was talking about, and I shared it with Andre to say, this is what he is talking about.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	… shared it with André to say, this is what he is talking about.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I put it back in, just be clear to the Ukrainians, this is what the conversation was.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, if I may, Congressman, I conveyed this to the Ukrainians in order to be clear, so we knew what the conversation was about. This was following up on this prior conversation. The Ukrainians then said they had reasons not to do that, and they described those reasons. And I agreed with them, and we agreed to just scrap the statement.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	From that point on, I didn’t have any further conversations about this statement, so I don’t know how it came up or why it came up that there would be a possibility of President Zelensky doing an interview with US media later saying something like this. And in the end, he didn’t do that either.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you, sir.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I agree with that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, that was, in fact, one of the key objectives of the presidential delegation at the inauguration, to take our own judgment and report back to the president.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I did.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	[crosstalk 01:05:58].
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe that the messages being conveyed by Mr. Giuliani were a problem because they were at variance with what our official message to the president was and not conveying that positive assessment that we all had. And so I thought it was important to try to step in and fix the problem.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thanks.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	There was someone that Mr. Giuliani brought along. I later learned that this was Lev Parnas, who we’ve learned a lot about since then.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	[inaudible 01:09:56].
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	There were two people that came to mind. One of them was a former investigative journalist and later a parliamentarian named Serhiy Leshchenko. Serhiy Leshchenko is someone that, in many of these stories, is seen as bringing forth a black ledger relating to Paul Manafort’s activities in Ukraine. That was one person.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	The other person I thought it could refer to was the person who was being named as President Zelensky’s chief of presidential administration, Andriy Bohdan. He was known as a lawyer for one of the main oligarchs in Ukraine, Ihor Kolomoyskyi, and there was a lot of controversy at the time about him being appointed to the administration.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t think either one of them is terrible people, no.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t think anyone should be above the law.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	There are channels for doing that for American citizens who may have committed crimes abroad.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct, and we often have treaties for that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I would only point to the statements from the administration at the time. There was a perception that our allies would oppose it, that Germany would oppose it. There was a perception that Germany should be in the lead. There was a perception that it could be provocative to Russia or escalate the conflict. As I’ve said extensively at the time and as special representative, I don’t agree with those arguments. And I believe that the record has borne out that providing those lethal defensive arms was actually very important.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe we had dinner. It was around the time of the YES conference.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I remember raising the issue of the possibility of prosecutions.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe … Excuse me, Congressman. I’m sorry. To be clear, there was a lot of talk in Kiev at that time about whether the new team would be prosecuting the former president. And I had met with President Poroshenko. I met with others in the opposition as well. And I wanted to call Mr. Yermak’s attention to the potential problems with this.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I’m very familiar with other examples of countries in the region that have gone for prosecutions of the former government, and these have created deep divisions in society. And so I cited President Zelensky’s inauguration speech … I’m sorry … his National Day speech from August 24th that was all about unifying the country. And I cautioned Mr. Yermak to say that pursuing of President Poroshenko risks deepening the divisions in the country, exactly the opposite of what President Zelensky has said he wants to do.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah, I discouraged him. I raised concerns about what the potential impact would be.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe, and I’m refreshed in this by seeing the testimony of others.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Mr. Taylor’s testimony.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Right, and I believe, based on that testimony, that Mr. Yermak said, “Well, what, you mean like asking us to investigate Clinton and Biden?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, I didn’t quite understand what he was referring to because, to my knowledge, we weren’t asking to investigate Clinton or Biden. And so I was kind of puzzled by the remark, and that’s why I didn’t respond.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I took it something of a deflection from the point I was making about unifying Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah. As I testified, I met with Mr. Giuliani once. And he did bring up Vice President Biden, and I pushed back on that. And I maintained a very clear distinction that Ukraine investigating its own citizens and corruption would be fine. Going beyond that to say, “We’re going to investigate the vice president,” is not fine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, so I know that I raised this with Ambassador Taylor in advance of that. We had been in some of the same meetings, some of the country team there. I don’t remember whether I had raised it with George Kent or Phil Reeker or not. I may well have done, but it was something that we had discussed as part of our meetings in Kiev at that time.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s what I recall now from seeing Ambassador Taylor’s testimony, yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	There is all kinds of corruption to investigate in Ukraine.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did not propose it.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did, yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, that’s correct. If it threads the needle between what is reasonable for Ukraine to do and if it resets the negative perceptions held by Mr. Giuliani and then the president, then why not?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Based on the transcript that was released on the 25th, I can see now that there was a lot else going on that was about Vice President Biden than I knew at the time. And the efforts that I was making were clearly not in the context of what had already been discussed by the president on July 25th.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	A very terse readout, but yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, there was not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, there was not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, there was not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, there was not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, they did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, they did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, they did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Let me bring up the aid. They did bring that up after the Politico article appeared on [crosstalk 00:24:28].
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Until then, no.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, it is.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I remember that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Not to my knowledge either.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, ma’am.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No evidence of treason.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	We’re talking about President Zelinsky?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	President Trump.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes it is.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, a few times.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I believe so.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, he did.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I’m not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe that a lawyer acts on his client’s behalf. I’m not sure about only on a client’s behalf, because I think as I understood Mayor Giuliani in this case, he was doing a lot that I considered to be on his own. I did not believe he was always instructed.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I am taking that from the statement.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I did not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I have no reason to think that he had discussed it with the President.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah, I don’t know who else he would have interacted [inaudible 01:34:22], having claimed that he met [inaudible 01:34:24] predecessor as Prosecutor General Mr. Lushanko.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s not under the Zelinsky government.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t know who else he would’ve met with.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	He cared about Ukraine. He wanted to see U.S. support for Ukraine increased. He wanted to see European union support for Ukraine increased, including maintenance of sanctions, and he wanted to be helpful.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t believe that he was not letting people know. I think he may have had some conversations, but I think he was just acting, and I think we circled back quite frequently with myself, Ambassador Taylor and others.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I can’t say that I had a clear understanding. I thought that Ambassador Sondland and I were working on the same objective, which is getting a meeting between President Zelinsky and President Trump, and that a statement as I understood it that mentioned Burisma in 2016 would be potentially helpful. I didn’t know anything more about their interactions or what their thoughts were.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I don’t.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I do.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Immediately after Masha was Joe Pennington.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I would say in line with all the rest of our policy.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Then that was Bill Taylor.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Very strong.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	In my case by Secretary Tillerson.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, serving in the same administration.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I’m sorry, the date again?
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I know that to be correct now.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I was not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	He claimed that he spoke to the President frequently.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Ambassador Sondland’s a big personality and sometimes says things that might be a bit bigger than life, but I-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Right, and I believe that he could speak with the President.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I have learned that yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t believe it is appropriate for the President to do that. If we have law enforcement concerns with a U.S. citizen, generally there are appropriate channels for that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you so much Congressman. I agree with you completely that we are not pushing back hard enough on Russia and that we owe Ukraine a great deal of support.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Russia is trying to upend security in Europe. It’s trying to reassert its domination of neighboring countries, whether it’s Georgia or Ukraine or the Baltic States. It has led to war in Europe. The war in Ukraine has left more people dead in Europe in a European war than anything since the Balkans. More people displaced by a war in Europe since anything since World War II. These are people who stand up for freedom, for democracy, they want reform, they want to see their country be successful, like Germany, like Sweden, like us. And they are fighting a war of aggression against them, designed to hold them back. And if we want to live in a world of freedom for the United States, we ought to be supporting freedom for people around the world.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t know the details of that, but I believe that to be correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes he has.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I did not know that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Shoken.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t believe that’s in my testimony.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I would agree.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I don’t know everything about that, sir.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah. So, yes, sir. My objective was purely focused on support for Ukraine. National security and I now have learned through other testimony about the President’s statement, about investigating Biden, and other conversations that I did not know about.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is one thing that I learned a lot our of the testimony of others.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Right, I had separated the two.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, sir. I understood at the time that Hunter Biden, Vice President Biden’s son, had been a board member of Burisma.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s right. I did not think he was talking about anything specific.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s not correct, sir. So I was not in Warsaw at these meetings.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, that’s not quite correct either. It was sometime later.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Right, that is correct, and [crosstalk 02:05:37]-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	What I would have raised is that people are conflating investigating the Bidens with investigating this Ukrainian company, Burisma-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	If I knew we were talking about investigating Vice President Biden and asking the Ukrainians to do that-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	… that would be inappropriate and I would have objected to that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I think confusing’s the right word because they were clearly hearing something different from the President in one conversation and different from me as a US Special Representative, different from Bill Taylor on the [crosstalk 02:06:33]-
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Well, I know they were asked in the phone call to do that, in the conversations that I had with the Ukrainians, we were not asking them to do that. And even at that point, the Ukrainians, perhaps with the knowledge of this phone call, which I did not have knowledge of at the time, is that we just don’t want to go there.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I believe it was important. I met with the staff members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I then saw the letter that several Senators signed and sent to Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and I was briefed about the possibility of some phone calls from some senior members of the Senate as well.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was not aware of that, but I take that.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I saw that in her testimony.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I don’t.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct, on August 29th.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, that is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is correct.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I do.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I saw that moment.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I don’t think that’s appropriate.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I have.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	No, I would not.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yeah, I believe that even when you feel like you need to criticize, criticism is private, praise is public.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I respect the service of our members in uniform.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	That is true.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Yes, I knew John McCain very, very well for a very long time. He’s an honorable man and very much a war hero for this country.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Hmm.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	I was not aware of that, and as with Ambassador Yovanovitch, not appropriate.
0201-11-19	Kurt Volker	W-Volker	W-Volker	Thank you.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Thank you Chairman Schiff, ranking member Nunez and other members of the committee for the opportunity to provide this statement. I appear today pursuant to a subpoena and I’m prepared to answer your questions to the best of my abilities.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I have had the privilege of working as a foreign service officer for nearly 14 years, working for three different presidential administrations, two Republican and one Democratic. I joined the State Department in 2006 after serving in the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Michael Chertoff. It was with great pride and conviction that I swore an oath to uphold and defend the constitution administered by a personal hero of mine, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. As a career officer, I am committed to serving the American people and advancing American interests abroad in support of the president’s foreign policy objectives. I have been inspired and encouraged in that journey by the thousands of other dedicated public servants who I’m proud to call colleagues across the foreign service, civil service, military and federal law enforcement agencies.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	"I have served overseas tours in Kingston, Jamaica; Beirut, Lebanon; and London, United Kingdom. I have worked to implement humanitarian assistance programs to serve millions of victims of the Syria conflict, and served as an advisor on middle East issues to the Deputy Secretary of State. And this spring, it was the greatest honor of my career to be asked to serve as a special advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia."
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Over the past eight months I have been privileged to work with the dedicated and capable men and women of the office of the Vice President to advance the administration’s agenda. I have also worked closely with talented and committed colleagues at the National Security Council, State Department, Department of Defense, and other agencies to advance and promote U.S. foreign policy objectives. In this capacity I have advised and prepared the Vice President for engagements related to Ukraine. As you are aware, on November 7th I appeared before the committee for a closed door deposition pursuant to a subpoena.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I would like to take this opportunity to briefly summarize my recollection of some of the events I expect the committee may ask me about.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	On April 21st, Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian presidential election. On April 23rd, the Vice President called to congratulate President-elect Zelensky. During the call, which I participated in, the Vice President accepted an invitation to attend President-elect Zelensky’s upcoming inauguration, providing that the scheduling worked out. The Vice President had only a narrow window of availability at the end of May and the Ukrainian parliament would not meet to set a date for the inauguration until after May 14th. As a result, we did not expect to know whether the Vice President would be, could attend until May 14th at the earliest and we made only preliminary trip preparations in early May. On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice President’s Chief of Staff called and informed me that President Trump had decided that the Vice President would not attend the inauguration in Ukraine.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	She did not provide any further explanation. I relayed that instruction to others involved in planning the potential trip. I also informed the NSC that the Vice President would not be attending so that it could identify a head of delegation to represent the United States at President-elect Zelensky’s inauguration. On July 3rd, I learned that the Office of Management and Budget had placed a hold on a traunch of security assistance designated for Ukraine. According to the information I received, OMB was reviewing whether the funding was aligned with the administration’s priorities. I subsequently attended meetings of the policy coordination committee where the hold on Ukrainian security assistance was discussed. During those meetings, representatives of the state and defense departments advocated that the hold should be lifted, and OMB representatives reported that the White House Chief of Staff had directed that the hold should remain in place. On September 11th, I learned that the hold on security assistance for Ukraine had been released. I have never learned what prompted that decision.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	On July 25th, along with several of my colleagues, I listened to a call between President Trump and President Zelensky, the content of which has since been publicly reported. Prior to July 25th, I had participated in roughly a dozen other presidential phone calls. During my closed door deposition members of the committee asked about my personal views and whether I had any concerns about the July 25th call. As I testified then, I found the July 25th phone call unusual because in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter. After the July 25th call, I provided an update in the Vice President’s daily briefing book, indicating that President Trump had a call that day with President Zelensky. A hard copy of the memorandum transcribing the call was also included in the book. I do not know whether the Vice President reviewed my update or the transcript. I did not discuss the July 25th call with Vice President or any of my colleagues in the office of the Vice President or the NSC.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	On August 29th, I learned that the Vice President would be traveling to Poland to meet with President Zelensky on September 1st. At the September 1st meeting, which I attended, President Zelensky asked the Vice President about news articles reporting a hold on U.S. security assistance for Ukraine. The Vice President responded that Ukraine had the United States’ unwavering support and promised to relay their conversation to President Trump that night. During the September 1st meeting, neither the Vice President nor President Zelensky mentioned the specific investigations discussed during the July 25th phone call.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this statement. I’d be happy to answer any questions.  Alexander Vindman Opening Statement
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I was.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I would also refer to my testimony that I gave in the closed session, and I’m very happy to appear for a classified setting discussion as well.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I’d be happy to do so.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes. That was my understanding.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I was informed by our chief of staff’s office by the vice president’s chief of staff’s office that the president had told the vice president not to attend. I did not witness that conversation.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I do not.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	My understanding was that OMB was reviewing the assistance to ensure it was in line with administration priorities, but it was not made more specific than that.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Mr. Chairman, I was asked during the closed door testimony how I felt about the call and in reflecting on what I was thinking in that moment, it was the first time I had heard internally the president reference particular investigations that previously I had only heard about through Mr. Giuliani’s press interviews in press reporting.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	So in that moment it was not clear whether there was a direct connection or linkage between the ongoing hold on security assistance and what the president may be asking President Zelensky to undertake in regard to investigations. So it was noteworthy in that regard. I did not have enough information to draw any firm conclusions.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	It was the first I had heard of any requests of Ukraine, which were that specific in nature. So it was noteworthy to me in that regard.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s right.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I do not. I was not involved in the production of that transcript.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Thank you.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Ukraine is one of the countries in my portfolio. I would not say an extraordinary amount of time, but certainly the vice president has engaged on Ukraine policy quite a bit in my eight months.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, not at the time.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I’ve since heard them, yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, I was not aware.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I did not work on Ukraine policy during that timeframe. So I’ve become aware of it through [crosstalk 00:01:21].
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I’ve become aware of it through Mr. Kent’s testimony through this process.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No. I was not aware.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Until [crosstalk 00:01:44].
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Until others have been testifying in more detail on those issues, that’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Again, sir, I was not working on Ukraine policy during that time.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I understand. Yeah.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I was not aware.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Not at the time. Again, I’ve become aware of that through this proceeding.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Okay.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, I did not.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I did not.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, I do not.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, I did not discuss the call with anyone outside or inside the White House.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I have not. And just to clarify, I’m in the office of the vice president, so not on the NSC.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, I have not. No.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Morning.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, I’m not.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I would say roughly a dozen.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	As I testified before, I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president’s reference to specific investigations and that struck me as different than other calls I had listened to.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations, such as former Vice President Biden and his son, struck me as political in nature, given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I can’t speak to what the president’s motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s what I was informed, yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, not in terms of that decision.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	President Zelensky asked the Vice President about the status of security assistance for Ukraine because he had seen the political article and other news reporting that the security assistance was being held.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	President Zelensky explained that just equally with the financial and physical value of the assistance, that it was the symbolic nature of that assistance that really was the show of US support for Ukraine and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I think he was stressing that to the Vice President to really underscore the need for the security assistance to be released.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I believe that’s what President Zelensky was indicating, that any signal or sign that US support was wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Vice President did not specifically discuss the reason behind the hold, but he did reassure President Zelensky of the strongest US unwavering support for Ukraine and they talked about the need for European countries to step up and provide more assistance to Ukraine as well.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	The Vice President conveyed to President Zelensky that he would follow up with President Trump that evening and convey to President Trump what he had heard from President Zelensky with regard to his efforts to implement reforms in Ukraine. I am aware that the Vice President spoke to President Trump that evening, but I was not privy to the conversation.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I didn’t take a word for word accounting.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	When I first saw the publicly released version, it looks substantively correct to me.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, I believe so.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s right, that’s where I have it in my notes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	And I said correct, yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Substantively accurate, yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	My supervisor was listening on the call as well, so because he had heard the same information, I did not feel the need to have a further conversation with him about it.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I did not discuss the call further with anyone in the vice president’s office.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Again, my immediate supervisor, Lieutenant General Kellogg was in the room with me.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	We did not, no.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I was.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, we did not include the call transcript in the [inaudible 00:05:46] briefing book. We don’t normally include previous calls in [inaudible 00:05:49] briefing books.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Again, my supervisor had been in the call with me and I ensured that the vice president had access to the transcript in the moment on that day. As we were preparing for the September meeting with President Zelensky, the more immediate issue at hand was two days prior, the news had broken about the hold on the security assistance. So we were much more focused on the discussion that was likely to occur about the hold on security assistance for that meeting.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I was.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, it did not.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Okay.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s right.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Our embassy in Kiev had been in discussions with the Ukrainian… With President Zelensky’s team. And as we had learned, obviously the Ukrainian parliament was not going to come back into session until mid-May, and so we wouldn’t know formally what the date would be. But we understood that the initial thinking was that they were looking at dates at the end of May. And so honing in on that timeframe, we were aware of President Trump’s plan to travel on either end. So that’s why we advised the Ukrainians that if Vice President Pence were to be able to participate, the only really available days would be May 30th, May 31st, or June 1st.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	My understanding is that our advanced team was looking into those preparations, including hotel availability. And we were trying to determine when it would be appropriate to send out Secret Service and other advanced personnel in order to lay groundwork for a trip. But because we weren’t sure yet when the date would be, we hesitated to send those officials out.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I don’t believe they did. No.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	In the end, the Ukrainian parliament decided on May 16th to set the date for May 20th. That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	It would have been, but we had already stopped the trip planning by that point.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Stopping the trip planning?
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	On May 13th.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I was called by a colleague in the Vice President’s Chief of Staff’s office and told to stop the trip planning.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Right.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s right.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I asked my colleague why we should stop trip planning and why the Vice President would not be attending. And I was informed that the President had decided the Vice President would not attend the inauguration.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, she did not have that information.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s right.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I’m really not in a position to speculate what the motivations were behind the President’s decision.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Absolutely. Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	For the trip… At what point?
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I was not involved in the trip planning for Canada. One of my colleagues who covers Western hemisphere was in charge of that.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	So I’m not aware of specific requests about the Vice President’s availability. I was aware, from my colleague who was planning that trip, that we had competing trips potentially for the same window. But I was told that the Ukraine trip would take priority.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I don’t know about the Canada trip or?
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I would say I don’t know the reason behind why the President directed the Vice President not to go to Ukraine. I can’t speak to the motivations about the Canada trip.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s right. The date had not been set. So we were weighing a number of different scenarios of when the inauguration might fall.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I had seen that in the press, yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	For having to cancel his trip?
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I had read that in their press reporting. Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I did read that, yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	It did. I believe it was around May 10th or so.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct. They did not come up.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	It was.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, he did not bring up those investigations. He’s never brought up those investigations.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I was not aware at the time of any meetings, side meetings that Ambassador Sondland had following the vice president’s meeting with President Zelensky. I’ve only learned that through Ambassador Sondland’s testimony.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Correct. The vice president moved on with his schedule immediately after his meeting with President Zelensky.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Mr. Chairman, I was asked during the closed door testimony how I felt about the call, and in reflecting on what I was thinking in that moment, it was the first time I had heard internally, the President reference particular investigations that previously I had only heard about through Mr. Giuliani’s press interviews in press reporting. So in that moment, it was not clear whether there was a direct connection or linkage between the ongoing hold on security assistance and what the President may be asking President Zelinsky to undertake, in regard to investigations. So it was noteworthy in that regard. I did not have enough information to draw any firm conclusions.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s right.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I do not. I was not involved in the production of that transcript.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct, sir.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s right.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, sir.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I’m not sure I know an official definition of a Never Trumper.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I would not, no.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	It certainly surprised me. I was not expecting to be called out by name.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Obviously anti corruption reforms is a big part of our policy.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I understand. I was not in a position to determine whether these particular investigations were appropriate.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That is, yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, sir.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	July 3rd.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I did. I attended meetings on July 23rd and July 26th where the security assistance hold was discussed. I believe it may have also been discussed on July 31st.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	In those meetings, the OMB representative reported that the assistance was being held at the direction of the White House Chief of Staff.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Not specifically. The reason given was that there was an ongoing review whether the funding was still in line with administration priorities.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	There were discussions, I believe, in the July 31st meeting and possibly prior as well, in terms of Defense and State Department officials were looking into how they would handle a situation in which ear-marked funding from Congress, that was designated for Ukraine, would be resolved if the funding continued to be held as we approached the end of the fiscal year.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I have not, no.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I can’t characterize how many, I believe there were four, five or six of us in the listening room at the time.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I wasn’t part of that process, but that’s my understanding.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I’m not. No.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I believe his remarks were consistent, but he also spoke on other issues as well, including anti-corruption.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	He has on occasion. It’s not a normal practice. It depends on the situation.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I would say that I provided talking points for the April 23 call for the vice president, which included discussion of President’s Zelensky’s inauguration, which President Trump had also discussed with President Zelensky. But I would say the vice president discussed other issues with President Zelensky as well.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Absolutely.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I insured, it was there. My colleagues prepare the book, but yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That’s correct. He did not.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I’m not in a position to speculate. We had not discussed those particular investigations in any of their preparatory sessions with the vice president. I’m not-
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	He did not in that meeting, no.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I did not speak to anybody about the call.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No. I did not participate or overhear any conversations along those lines.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That is, yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I don’t believe I’m in a position to characterize it further than the president did in terms of asking for a favor.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Again, I would just refer back to the transcript itself.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I ensured that the information was available to my superiors.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I would say that certainly in terms of the specific relationship between NATO and Ukraine, that would fall to ambassador Hutchison. And between the EU and Ukraine to ambassador Sondland. But obviously we have an ambassador in Ukraine as well.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	I have not read the other testimonies and I…
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	No, because I have not read them.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Thank you.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I had the honor of speaking to a group of veterans this past weekend and what I said to them was that no words, no words are really adequate or sufficient to fully express our gratitude for their service to our nation. So Lieutenant Colonel Vindman today I say to you, there are no words that are sufficient to fully express our gratitude to you for what you have done for our nation and amazingly what you are still willing to do for our nation.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	It is vitally important that the American people understand how President Trump’s unethical demand that Ukraine deliver politically motivated investigations in exchange for military assistance created our security risks for our the United States of America national security. The President was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with Ukraine. Threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that Congress had appropriated has real life consequences for Ukraine and for the USA.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	In you’re deposition, Colonel Vindman, you testified, and I quote, “A strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our security interests.” Could you please explain why a strong and independent Ukraine is so critical and why it is so vital to us interests?
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Yes sir.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	Correct.
0201-11-19	J. Williams	W-Williams	W-Williams	That was my testimony.
2019-12-04	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I didn’t know what to think, but I was very concerned.
2019-12-04	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	She’s going to go through some things. It didn’t sound good. It sounded like a threat.
2019-12-04	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I did.
2019-12-09	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I later served in Moscow. In 1993 during the attempted coup in mosque in Russia, I was caught in crossfire between presidential and parliamentary forces. It took us three tries, me without a helmet or body armor, to get into a vehicle to go to the embassy. We went because the Ambassador asked us to come, and we went because it was our duty.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Nunes, and other members of the committee-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you for the opportunity to start with this statement. To reintroduce myself to the committee and to highlight parts of my biography and experience, I come before you as an American citizen who has devoted the majority of my life, 33 years, to service to the country that all of us love. Like my colleagues, I entered the foreign service understanding that my job was to implement the foreign policy interests of this nation as defined by the president and Congress and to do so regardless of which person or party was in power. I had no agenda other than to pursue our stated foreign policy goals. My service is an expression of gratitude for all that this country has given to me and to my family. My late parents did not have the good fortune to come of age in a free society.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	My father fled the Soviets before ultimately finding refuge in the United States. My mother’s family escaped the USSR after the Bolshevik Revolution and she grew up stateless in Nazi Germany before also eventually making her way to the United States. Their personal histories, my personal history, gave me both deep gratitude towards the United States and great empathy for others like the Ukrainian people who want to be free. I joined the foreign service during the Reagan administration and subsequently served three other Republican presidents as well as two Democratic presidents. It was my great honor to be appointed to serve as an ambassador three times, twice by George W. Bush, and once by Barack Obama.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	There is a perception that diplomats lead a comfortable life throwing dinner parties in fancy homes. Let me tell you about some of my reality. It has not always been easy. I have moved 13 times and served in seven different countries, five of them hardship posts. My first tour was Mogadishu, Somalia, an increasingly dangerous place as that country’s civil war kept grinding on and the government was weakening. The military took over policing functions in a particularly brutal way and basic services disappeared. Several years later after the Soviet Union collapsed, I helped open our embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. As we were establishing relations with a new country, our small embassy was attacked by a gunman who sprayed the embassy building with gunfire.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I later served in Moscow. In 1993 during the attempted coup in Moscow in Russia, I was caught in crossfire between presidential and parliamentary forces. It took us three tries, me without a helmet or body armor to get into a vehicle to go to the embassy. We went because the ambassador asked us to come and we went because it was our duty. From August 2016 until May 2019, I served as the US ambassador to Ukraine. During my tenure in Ukraine, I went to the front line approximately 10 times during a hot war to show the American flag, to hear what was going on, sometimes literally as we heard the impact of artillery, and to see how our assistance dollars were being put to use.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I worked to advance US policy, fully embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike, to help Ukraine become a stable and independent democratic state with a market economy integrated into Europe. A secure democratic and free Ukraine serves not just the Ukrainian people, but the American people as well. That’s why it was our policy, continues to be our policy, to help the Ukrainians achieve their objectives. They match our objectives. The US is the most powerful country in the history of the world in large part because of our values and our values have made possible the network of alliances and partnerships that buttresses our own strength. Ukraine with an enormous landmass and a large population, has the potential to be a significant commercial and political partner for the United States as well as a force multiplier on the security side.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	We see the potential in Ukraine. Russia sees, by contrast, sees the risk. The history is not written yet, but Ukraine could move at out of Russia’s orbit. And now, Ukraine is a battleground for great power competition with a hot war for the control of territory and a hybrid war to control Ukraine’s leadership. The US has provided significant security assistance since the onset of the war against Russia in 2014, and the Trump administration strengthened our policy by approving the provision to Ukraine of anti-tank missiles, known as Javelins. Supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do. It’s also the smart thing to do. If Russia prevails and Ukraine falls to Russian dominion, we can expect to see other attempts by Russia to expand its territory and its influence.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	As critical as the war against Russia is, Ukraine’s struggling democracy has an equally important challenge, battling the Soviet legacy of corruption which has pervaded Ukraine’s government. Corruption makes Ukraine’s leaders ever vulnerable to Russia, and the Ukrainian people understand that. That’s why they launched the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, demanding to be a part of Europe, demanding the transformation of the system, demanding to live under the rule of law. Ukrainians wanted the law to apply equally to all people, whether the individual in question is the president or any other citizen. It was a question of fairness, of dignity. Here again, there is a coincidence of interest. Corrupt leaders are inherently less trustworthy, while an honest and accountable Ukrainian leadership makes a US-Ukrainian partnership more reliable and more valuable to the United States.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	A level playing field, in this strategically located country bordering for NATO allies, creates an environment in which US business can more easily trade, invest and profit. Corruption is also a security issue, because corrupt officials are vulnerable to Moscow. In short, it is in America’s national security interest to help Ukraine transform into a country where the rule of law governs and corruption is held in check. It was and remains a top US priority to help Ukraine fight corruption, and significant progress has been made since the 2014 Revolution of Dignity. Unfortunately, as the past couple of months have underlined, not all Ukrainians embraced our anti-corruption work. Thus, perhaps it was not surprising that when our anti-corruption efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old corrupt rules sought to remove me. What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of the US ambassador.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	How could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government? Which country’s interests are served when the very corrupt behavior we have been criticizing is allowed to prevail? Such conduct undermines the US, exposes our friends, and widens the playing field for autocrats like President Putin. Our leadership depends on the power of our example and the consistency of our purpose. Both have now been opened to question. With that background in mind, I’d like to briefly address some of the factual issues I expect you may want to ask me about, starting with my timeline in Ukraine and the events about which I do and do not have firsthand knowledge.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I arrived in Ukraine on August 22nd, 2016, and left Ukraine permanently on May 20th, 2019. There are a number of events you are investigating to which I cannot bring any firsthand knowledge. The events that predated my Ukraine service include the release of the so-called black ledger and Mr. Manafort’s subsequent resignation from President Trump’s campaign, and the departure from office of former Prosecutor General, Viktor Shokin. Several other events occurred after I returned from Ukraine. These include President Trump’s July 25th, 2019 call with President Zelensky, the discussions surrounding that phone call, and any discussions surrounding the delay of security assistance to Ukraine in the summer of 2019.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	As for events during my tenure in Ukraine, I want to reiterate first that the allegation that I disseminated a do not prosecute list was a fabrication. Mr. Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General who made that allegation, has acknowledged that the list never existed. I did not tell Mr. Lutsenko or other Ukrainian officials who they should or should not prosecute. Instead, I advocated the US position that rule of law should prevail, and Ukrainian law enforcement prosecutors and judges should stop wielding their power selectively as a political weapon against their adversaries and start dealing with all consistently and according to the law.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Also untrue are unsourced allegations that I told unidentified embassy employees or Ukrainian officials that President’s Trump’s orders should be ignored because he was going to be impeached or for any other reason. I did not and I would not say such a thing. Such statements would be inconsistent with my training as a foreign service officer and my role as an ambassador. The Obama administration did not ask me to help the Clinton campaign or harm the Trump campaign, nor would I have taken any such steps if they had. Partisanship of this type is not compatible with the role of a career of foreign service officer. I have never met Hunter Biden, nor have I had any direct or indirect conversations with him.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	And although I have met former Vice President, Biden, several times over the course of our many years in government service, neither he nor the previous administration ever raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with me. With respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have had only minimal contact with him, a total of three, none related to the events at issue. I do not understand Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me, nor can I offer an opinion on whether he believe the allegations he spread about me. Clearly, no one at the State Department did. What I can say is that Mr. Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	After being asked by the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs in early March 2019 to extend my tour until 2020, the smear campaign against me entered a new public phase in the United States. In the wake of the negative press, State Department officials suggested an earlier departure, and we agreed upon July 2019. I was then abruptly told, just weeks later in late April, to come back to Washington from Ukraine on the next plane. At the time I departed, Ukraine had just concluded game changing presidential elections. It was a sensitive period, with much at stake for the United States and called for all the experience and expertise we could muster. When I returned to the United States, Deputy Secretary of State, Sullivan, told me there had been a concerted campaign against me, that the president no longer wished me to serve as ambassador to Ukraine, and that in fact, the president had been pushing for my removal since the prior summer.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	As Mr. Sullivan recently recounted during his Senate confirmation hearing, neither he nor anyone else ever explained or sought to justify the president’s concerns about me, nor did anyone in the department justify my early departure by suggesting I had done something wrong. I appreciate that Mr. Sullivan publicly affirmed at his hearing that I had served capably and admirably. Although then and now I have always understood that I served at the pleasure of the president, I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine US interests in this way. Individuals who apparently felt stymied by our efforts to promote stated US policy against corruption, that is to do our mission, were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador using unofficial back channels.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	As various witnesses have recounted, they shared baseless allegations with the president and convinced him to remove his ambassador, despite the fact that the State Department fully understood that the allegations were false and the sources highly suspect. These events should concern everyone in this room. Ambassadors are the symbol of the United States abroad. They are the personal representative of the president. They should always act and speak with full authority to advocate for US policies. If our chief representative is kneecapped, it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the United States.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	This is especially important now when the international landscape is more complicated and more competitive than it has been since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Our Ukraine policy has been thrown into disarray, and shady interests the world over have learned how little it takes to remove an American ambassador who does not give them what they want. After these events, what foreign official, corrupt or not, could be blamed for wondering whether the US ambassador represents the president’s views? And what US ambassador could be blamed for harboring the fear they can’t count on our government to support them as they implement stated US policy and protect and defend US interests?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’d like to comment on one other matter before taking your questions. At the closed deposition, I expressed grave concerns about the degradation of the Foreign Service over the past few years and the failure of State Department leadership to push back as foreign and corrupt interests apparently hijacked our Ukraine policy. I remain disappointed that the Department’s leadership and others have declined to acknowledge that the attacks against me and others are dangerously wrong. This is about far, far more than me or a couple of individuals. As Foreign Service professionals are being denigrated and undermined, the institution is also being degraded.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	This will soon cause real harm if it hasn’t already. The State Department as a tool of foreign policy often doesn’t get the same kind of attention or even respect as the military might of the Pentagon, but we are, as they say, the pointy end of the spear. If we lose our edge, the US will inevitably have to use other tools even more than it does today, and those other tools are blunter, more expensive and not universally effective. Moreover, attacks are leading to a crisis in the State Department as the policy process is visibly unraveling. Leadership vacancies go unfilled, and senior and mid-level officers ponder an uncertain future. The crisis has moved from the impact on individuals to an impact on the institution itself. The State Department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	This is not a time to undercut our diplomats. It is the responsibility of the Department’s leaders to stand up for the institution and the individuals who make that institution still today, the most effective diplomatic force in the world. And Congress has a responsibility to reinvest in our diplomacy. That’s an investment in our national security. It’s an investment in our future and our children’s future. As I close, let me be clear on who we are and how we serve this country. We are professionals. We are public servants who by vocation and training, pursue the policies of the president, regardless of who holds that office or what party they affiliate with. We handle American citizen services, facilitate trade and commerce, work security issues, represent the US and report to and advise Washington, to mention just some of our functions, and we make a difference every day. We are people who repeatedly uproot our lives, who risk and sometimes give our lives for this country.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	We are the 52 Americans who 40 years ago this month, began 444 days of deprivation, torture and captivity in Tehran. We are the dozens of Americans stationed at our Embassy in Cuba, and consulates in China, who mysteriously and dangerously, and in some cases perhaps even permanently, were injured and attacked from unknown sources several years ago. And we are Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Patrick Smith, Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, people rightly called heroes for their ultimate sacrifice to this nation’s foreign policy interests in Libya eight years ago. We honor these individuals. They represent each one of you here and every American. These courageous individuals were attacked because they symbolized America.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	What you need to know, what Americans need to know, is that while thankfully most of us answer the call to duty in far less dramatic ways, every foreign service officer runs the same risks, and very often, so do our families. They serve too. As individuals, as a community, we answer the call to duty to advance and protect the interests of the United States. We take our oath seriously, the same oath that each one of you take, to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same. I count myself lucky to be a Foreign Service Officer, fortunate to serve with the best America has to offer, blessed to serve the American people for the last 33 years. I thank you for your attention. I welcome your questions.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, it was.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	It was important, and it was actually stated in our policy and in our strategy, it was important because corruption was undermining the integrity of the governance system in Ukraine. And as I noted in my statement, countries that have leaders that are honest and trustworthy make better partners for us. Countries where there is a level playing field for our US business makes it easier for our companies to do business there, to trade and to profit in those countries, and what had been happening since the Soviet Union, and this is very much a Soviet legacy, is that corrupt interests were undermining not only the governance, but also the economy of Ukraine. We see enormous potential in Ukraine and would like to have a more capable, more trustworthy partner there.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, I believe so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Apparently so, although I’ve never met him.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that is what I was told.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that is my understanding.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, yes, that is the case.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that is correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Since then I have become aware of that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m just not sure what the basis for that kind of a statement would be. Certainly not from our reporting over years.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, it’s I think been a big hit for morale both at the US Embassy Kiev but also more broadly, in the State Department.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think that is a fair statement, yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I was hosting an event in honor of Kateryna Handziuk, who is an anti-corruption activist or was an anti-corruption activist in Ukraine. We had given her the Woman of Courage award from Ukraine and in fact, the Worldwide Woman of Courage event at the Worldwide Women of Courage event in Washington DC. Secretary Pompeo singled her out for her amazing work in Ukraine to fight corrupt interest in the south of Ukraine. She very tragically died because she was attacked by acid and several months later died a very, very painful death. We thought it was important that justice be done for Kateryna Handziuk and for others to fight corruption in Ukraine because this is, it’s not a tabletop exercise. Their lives are in the balance. And so we wanted to bring attention to this. We held an event and gave her father who of course is still mourning her, that award, the Woman of Courage event.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that is true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	There had been investigations but while some of the lower ranking individuals that were involved in this have been arrested, those who ordered this have not yet been apprehended.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	She said that there was a great concern on the seventh floor of the State Department, that is where the leadership of the State Department sits, there was great concern, they were worried. She just wanted to give me a heads up about this and things seem to be going on and so she just wanted to give me a heads up. I had to know how to react to something like that. I asked her what it was about, what did she think it was about. She didn’t know. She said that she was going to try and find out more but she had wanted to give me a heads up. In fact, I think she may even have been instructed to give me a heads up on that. And so I asked her, what is the next step here? So she said she would try to find out more and she would try to call me by midnight.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Around one o’clock in the morning, she called me again and she said that there were great concerns, there were concerns up the street and she said I needed to get home… come home immediately, get on the next plane to the US. And I asked her why, and she said she wasn’t sure but there were concerns about my security. I asked her, “My physical security?” Because sometimes Washington knows more than we do about these things, and she said no, she hadn’t gotten that impression that it was a physical security issue but they were concerned about my security and I needed to come home right away. I argued. This is extremely irregular and no reason given. But in the end, I did get on the next plane home.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	The White House.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, she didn’t. I did specifically ask whether this had to do with the Mayor Giuliani’s allegations against me and so forth, and she said she didn’t know. It didn’t even actually appear to me that she seemed to be aware of that. No, no reason was offered.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	The only thing that’s pertinent to that was that when she said that there were concerns about my security. That’s all but it was not further explained.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs had asked whether I would extend for another year departing in July of 2020.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	In early March.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m not exactly sure, but I took it to mean that the allegations that Mayor Giuliani and others were putting out there that that’s what it was.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	There were some members of the press and others in Mayor Giuliani’s circle.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	In Ukraine, I think, well, Mr. Lutsenko, the Prosecutor General, and Mr. Shokin, his predecessor certainly.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that is correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He had indicated he would not be keeping on Mr. Lutsenko.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, he told me I needed to leave.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He said that… I mean there was a lot of back and forth but ultimately he said the words that every foreign service officer understands, the president has lost confidence in you. That was a terrible thing to hear. And I said, “Well, I guess I have to go then.” But no real reason was offered as to why I had to leave and why it was being done in such a manner.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I was not until that meeting with Deputy Secretary, Sullivan.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, my understanding was that the president had wanted me to leave and there was some discussion about that over the prior months.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, it was just a statement made that he was no longer able to protect me.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Terrible honestly. After 33 years of service to our country, it was terrible. It is not the way I wanted my career to end.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I was worried about our policy, but also personnel that… and I asked him, “How are you going to explain this to people in the State Department, the press, the public, the Ukrainians because everybody is watching?” And so if people see somebody who… And of course, it had been very public, frankly, the attacks on me by Mayor Giuliani and others and Mr. Lutsenko in Ukraine, if people see that I who have been promoting our policies on anti-corruption, if they can undermine me and get me pulled out of Ukraine, what does that mean for our policy? Do we still have that same policy? How are we going to affirm it if we put that forward, number one? Number two, when other countries, other actors in other countries, see that private interests, foreign interests can come together and get a US ambassador removed, what’s going to stop them from doing that in the future in other countries?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Often, the work we do, we try to be diplomatic about it, but as Deputy Assistant Secretary, George Kent, said, sometimes we get people really angry with us. It’s uncomfortable. And we are doing our jobs, but sometimes people become very angry with us. And if they realize that they can just remove us, they’re going to do that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He said those were good questions and he would get back to me.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He asked to see me the following day.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He… really, the conversation was more, and again, I’m grateful for this, but really more to see how I was doing and what would I do next, kind of how could he help.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s right.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	When it was released publicly at the end of September, I believe.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I was shocked. Absolutely shocked and devastated, frankly.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I was shocked and devastated that I would feature in a phone call between two heads of state in such a manner where President Trump said that I was bad news to another world leader and that I would be going through some things. So I was… It was a terrible moment. A person who saw me actually reading the transcript said that the color drained from my face. I think I even had a physical reaction. I think, even now, words kind of fail me.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I couldn’t believe it. Again, shocked, appalled, devastated that the president of the United States would talk about any ambassador like that to a foreign head of state, and it was me. I couldn’t believe it.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I didn’t know what to think, but I was very concerned.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	She’s going to go through some things. It didn’t sound good. It sounded like a threat.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I did.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I didn’t know exactly. It is not a very precise phrase, but I think it didn’t feel like I was… I really don’t know how to answer the question any further except to say that it felt like a vague threat, and so I wondered what that meant. It concerned me.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, it was not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That was our belief.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, it was disappointing, it was concerning. It wasn’t certainly based on anything that the State Department would have reported or, frankly, anybody else in the US government. There was an interagency consensus that while… When Mr. Lutsenko came into office, we were very hopeful that he would actually do the things that he said he would set out to do, including reforming the Prosecutor General’s office, but that did not materialize.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Right.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I didn’t really know, but that’s what I had been told by Ukrainian officials.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, now with the advantage of hindsight, I think that meant removing me from my job in Ukraine.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, certainly Mr. Lutsenko, Mr. Shokin. I believe that there were also Ukrainian Americans, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who have recently been indicted.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	The Southern District of New York.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	They seemed to be promoted by those around Mayor Giuliani.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I was worried.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That this didn’t seem… These attacks were being repeated by the president himself and his son.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, I did.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	As you said, there was a series of articles. So, after the first article, which was an interview with Mr. Lutsenko and was only really about me and made certain allegations about me, the State Department came out the following day with a very strong statement saying that these allegations were fabrications.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Honestly, I haven’t looked at it in a very long time. I think it was generally probably laudatory. I can’t recall.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, people thought it was ridiculous.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, after the tweets that you just showed us, it seemed to me that if the president’s son is saying things like this, that it would be very hard to continue in my position and have authority in Ukraine unless the State Department came out pretty strongly behind me. And so, over the weekend of like March 22nd, I think that’s about the date, there was a lot of discussion on email among a number of people about what could be done. I and Under Secretary… The Under Secretary for Political Affairs called me on Sunday, and I said, “It’s really important that the secretary himself come out and be supportive, because otherwise it’s hard for me to be the kind of representative you need here.” And he said he would talk to the secretary. That’s my recollection of the call. That may not be exactly how it played out. That was my recollection.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think he must have, because I don’t think he would have gone to the secretary if he didn’t support it. He wouldn’t bring a bad idea to the secretary of state.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, it was not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, yes, I was told that there was concern on the seventh floor that if the statement of support was issued, whether by the State Department or by the secretary personally, that it could be undermined.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That the president might issue a tweet contradicting that or something to that effect.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s my understanding.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, advise and consent.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I don’t think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu, Somalia and not in other places. I actually think that where I’ve served over the years, I and others have demonstrably made things better for the US as well as for the countries that I’ve served in. Ukraine, for example, where there are huge challenges, including, on the issue that we are discussing today of corruption, huge challenges, but they’ve made a lot of progress since 2014, including in the years that I was there. And I think in part, the Ukrainian people get the most credit for that. But a part of that credit goes to the work of the United States and to me as the ambassador in Ukraine.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, it’s very intimidating.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I can’t speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	The US relationship for Ukraine is the single most important relationship, and so I think that President Zelensky, any president, would do what they could to lean in on a favor request. I’m not saying that that’s a yes, I’m saying they would try to lean in and see what they could do.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	If he could. I’m sure there are limits, and I understand there were a lot of discussions in the Ukrainian government about all of this, but yeah, we are an important relationship on the security side and on the political side. And so the president of Ukraine, one of the most important functions that individual has is to make sure the relationship with the US is rock solid.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	There have been rumors out there about things like that, but there was nothing hard, at least nothing that I was aware of.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, the US Intelligence Community has concluded that it was Russia.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Maybe I knew that once and have forgotten, but I’m not familiar with it now.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, President Putin must have been aware that there were concerns in the US about Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, and what the potential was for Russian meddling in the future. So classic for an intelligence officer to try to throw off the scent and create an alternative narrative that maybe might get picked up and get some credence.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Maybe.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Official US policy. That was endorsed and was the policy of a number of other international stakeholders, other countries, other monetary institutions, financial institutions.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	One would think so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I should say that I had, at the time of this phone call, I had already departed Ukraine two months prior.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	It certainly would not have been the policy in May when I left.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, they certainly could.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, sir, I do.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I have no reason to think otherwise.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I was not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	For the delay in…?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	The pause? No, I was not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I was not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I have not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I have not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I stated that clearly in my statement.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I do.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m very grateful to be in that position after what happened.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I heard about the call, as I indicated in the first deposition, from Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, as it turns out, it wasn’t correct, but what I recall is that he said that President Trump had asked President Zelensky whether he could help him out and which I understood to be these investigations. And that President Zelensky had said that he is putting in a new prosecutor general and that he doesn’t control… I mean, this is approximately what he said, that that person is an independent individual.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No discussions.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t know that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think that’s certainly what the Ukrainian establishment hoped. I think that in addition, there were Americans, these two individuals who were working with Mayor Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman who have recently been indicted by the Southern District of New York, who indicated that they wanted change out the ambassador. And I think they must’ve had some reason for that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t know what other reason there would be.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Absolutely.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He is. I would note that he is the chargé out there as of course you understand. So no ambassador has yet been… or no candidate has yet been named to the position.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Absolutely. A man of the highest integrity.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	We were picking up rumors from Ukrainians, I think, kind of in the November-December 2018 time period. But then in January, February, and of course March, it became more obvious.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He had a conversation with me in February of 2019.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. He said that Mr. Lutsenko was working with Mayor Giuliani through these two individuals, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. That they basically wanted to remove me from post, and that they were working on that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	You know, I didn’t understand that at all, because I had never met Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. And so it was unclear to me why they were interested in doing this.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think that just the general idea that obviously US ambassadors, US embassies, one of our most important functions is to facilitate US business abroad, right? Whether it’s trade, whether it’s commerce, that’s one of the things that we do. But everything has to be above board. We believe in a level playing ground and so forth, but we obviously advocate for US business. These two individuals, with hindsight and what we learned later, looking to open up a new energy company exporting liquefied natural gas to Ukraine, never actually came to the embassy, which is unusual. Because that would usually be a first-off, going to the American Chamber of Commerce, going to the US Embassy, get the lay of the land, see how we could provide assistance.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Source of frustration? What do you mean? On whose part?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t know that they were frustrated. I mean, I… Frustrated by what?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’d never met them. When I heard those names for the first time, which was in February of 2019, I asked my team. The econ and the commercial sections are the ones who would usually meet with American businessmen and women. And nobody had heard of them. So all I can conclude is that it was the general US policies that we were implementing that might’ve been of concern to them.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I didn’t feel that there was any purpose to it.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He is… He clearly had, I would say, an animus for doing this. And he was working with Americans, so I reached out to the American side, in this case the State Department, to try and find out what was going on.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Probably around that time, maybe a little bit earlier.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. And what I would say, adversarial, that’s a really strong word. We at the US Embassy or our visiting key people from the State Department and other agencies, we were pushing the Ukrainians, including Mr. Lutsenko, to do what they said that they were going to do when Mr. Lutsenko entered office. That he was going to clean up the PGO and make reforms, that he was going to bring justice to the what they call the Heavenly Hundred, the people who died on the Maidan in 2014, the Revolution of Dignity. And he was going to prosecute cases to repatriate approximately $40 billion it’s believed that former President Yanukovych and his cronies fled the country with. And he didn’t do any of that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	And we kept on trying to encourage him to do the right thing. That’s what the Ukrainian people wanted him to do, and we thought it was a good plan and that he should do it.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	So contacted about what?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I contacted the State Department much earlier than that. I mean, it was an ongoing sort of… “discussion” makes it sound very formal. We have many ways of going back and forth with Washington. And so, on phone calls or DVCs, we would have this discussion.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	And if I could just amplify my answer, we had the discussion because we were concerned that Ukrainian policymakers, Ukrainian leaders, were hearing that I was going to be leaving, that there was maybe somebody else waiting in the wings, et cetera. And that undermined not only my position, but our US position. The Ukrainians didn’t know what to think. And we need to be out there all the time firing on all cylinders to promote our national security interest. So it was a concern.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	A threat in…?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I would say that the… When you go into a meeting with somebody and they ask, “Are you going to be leaving?” that is concerning. So that probably… I don’t know exactly when that started happening, but in that timeframe.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, certainly with the Ukrainians, I said, “There’s nothing to this. This is a distraction, and we are focused on the job. Our policy remains the same.” And, yes, we had discussions in the State Department about this.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I did what I could.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Reached out to the the European Bureau. I think you’ve also heard that Dr. Fiona Hill was aware of this as well, so the NSC. And they had other discussions with more senior people.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	So, they’re different timeframes here that we’re talking about. So fast-forwarding to March, I did, when Under Secretary Hale asked whether I would consider extending, I did raise, because I wasn’t sure that he was aware of it. I wanted to make sure that he knew that Mayor Giuliani had been out there saying things about me, untrue things, and I wanted him to be aware of that. And he said he understood. He still was hoping that I could extend for another year. So that was early March.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	And then fast-forward to late March, and the discussions about this issue continued, but obviously it became… Once it became a public political story here in the United States, the tenor of everything changed. Because I think that the State Department felt that it wasn’t manageable anymore and that the more prudent thing would be for me to come back in July.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think that, sure, maybe I could’ve done that, but I think they were aware. And as I subsequently learned from Deputy Secretary Sullivan, the Secretary of State had been well aware of this since the summer of 2018.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I would say that corruption is a serious issue everywhere in the former Soviet Union. It’s a post-Soviet legacy. And we talk about it a lot in Ukraine, because there’s actually an opportunity to do something, to actually help the Ukrainians tackle the issue. They want to tackle the issue. In other countries like Russia, you can’t even talk about it. So I think it’s a post-Soviet legacy, and it’s important to deal with it.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. That’s a fair statement.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, because it’s good for the Ukrainians, but it’s also in our interest.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I believe that to be true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Probably because so much wealth is concentrated in the hands of a very, very few, six or seven individuals, and they also have political power and control the medium.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, I think that’s a fair comment.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t know him, but I know who you’re talking about.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’ve heard about it. This was before my arrival. And I would just say my understanding, but please correct me if I’m wrong, is that the US money that you’re referring to was the money that we used to fund an FBI team that was embedded with the Prosecutor General’s Office to go after… not to go after, but to do the investigation of Burisma and Zlochevsky.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Is that on the part of the Ukrainian government? Is that what you’re talking about?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think, yes, there have been some efforts. And as I mentioned earlier in my testimony, the US was welcoming of Mr. Lutsenko’s nomination to the position of prosecutor general, because we were hoping he would clean that up. That, in fact, is not what happened. It’s kind of hard to explain to a US audience, but in Ukraine, and in the former Soviet Union more broadly, including in Russia, the justice system, whether it’s cops on the beat, whether it’s investigators, whether it is prosecutors, whether it is judges, are used as a tool of the political system, to be used against your political adversaries.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	And so, I think that, going back to your question about Burisma and Zlochevsky, my understanding… This was, as I told you earlier in the previous deposition, this did not loom large when I arrived. I arrived in 2016, August 2016, but over time, my understanding was that the case was basically sort of on a pause. That it wasn’t an active case, but it also was not fully closed. And that is a way, as I mentioned before, for those in power to keep a little hook in to Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, I don’t exactly know what the timing of all of this was. But, yes. I mean, to the elements.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	As I said, I arrived in August of 2016, several months before the elections and several months before President Trump took office. And it was not a focus of what I was doing in that six-month period.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Not…
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, my understanding from newspaper accounts is that he just recently left, in 2019. I never met him. Never talked to him. And I’m sorry, what was your question?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I was aware of it, because as I told you before in the deposition, there had been a… In terms of the preparation for my Senate confirmation hearings for Ukraine, there was a question about that and a select answer. So I was aware of it. Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s what he says.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, he said that a friend of his had told him that Ukraine was the most corrupt country in the world.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I’m certainly aware of it now. Obviously, there’s been a lot of press attention on that. It was not brought to my attention during the two and a half years that I served under President Trump as our ambassador to Ukraine.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Actually there weren’t. We didn’t really see it that way.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I saw the article. I didn’t have any further information about that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	It’s certainly been brought to my attention subsequently. I think I did see something to that effect at the time as well.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I was the ambassador in Ukraine starting in August of 2016 and what you’re describing, if true, as you said, what you’re describing took place in the United States. So if there were concerns about what Miss Chalupa was doing, I think that that would have been handled here.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	… Miss Chalupa was doing. I think that would have been handled here.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t believe so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t think so. I mean, if she worked for the Ukrainian Embassy it’s possible that I met her in a large group or something, but I don’t believe I know her.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I certainly noticed it, because I was a week or so away from arriving in Ukraine. I think that, from a Ukrainian perspective … I realize we are looking at this from an American perspective. From a Ukrainian perspective, I think that what Mr. Leshchenko and others who were looking into the black ledger were most concerned about was actually not Mr. Manafort but former President Yanukovych, and his political party, and the amount of money that they allegedly stole, and where it went, and so forth. I mean, I think there’s just a difference in perspective, depending on which country you’re in.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, just speaking about Mr. Leshchenko, he’s an investigative journalist, as you said, and he got access to the black ledger, and he published it, as I think journalists would do. And again, I’m not sure that that … I don’t have any information to suggest that that was being … that was targeting President Trump.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Again, I think that that may have been the effect here in the United States. And obviously, it was of interest to journalists and others here that Mr. Manafort was former President Yanukovych’s political advisor, and he was the political advisor, head of a campaign here, and so, we all know that there have been court cases and so forth where Mr. Manafort was found guilty of certain actions. But at the end of the day, President Trump won the elections.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m sorry, could you repeat that?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Okay. I wasn’t aware of that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. Didn’t actually see him or talk to him that often.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	My recollection of that op-ed was that he was taking a … He was critical of a policy position that President Trump had with regard to Crimea and whether Crimea was a part of Ukraine or a part of Russia. That’s a tremendously sensitive issue in Ukraine and my recollection is that that is what Ambassador Chaly was writing about.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t know.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. As a result of the deposition, the previous deposition.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t recall it.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	He is.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That he was doing what? I’m sorry.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, sometimes that happens on social media and I … Are you asking me whether it’s appropriate? Probably not, but I would say that Minister Avakov has been, as well as others, both in President Poroshenko’s administration, as well as in the Zelensky administration, has been a good partner to the United States. As I think I told you before, he’s a very practical man and looking for partners in getting the job done.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Again, I mean, I can’t speak for what President Trump thought or what others thought. I would just say that those elements that you’ve recited don’t seem to me to be the Ukrainian … kind of a plan or plot of the Ukrainian government to work against President Trump or anyone else. I mean, they’re isolated incidents. We all know, I’m coming to find out myself, that public life can be … People are critical and that does not mean that someone is or a government is undermining either a campaign or interfering in elections. I would just remind again that our own US intelligence community has conclusively determined that the those who interfered in the election were in Russia.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s true. Could I have water?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I believe that to be true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think that he tried to do what he thought was right.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	With the provision of Javelins to the Ukrainian military, Yes. That was really positive.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, two things. They are, obviously, tank busters and so if the war with Russia all of a sudden accelerated in some way and tanks come over the horizon, Javelins are a very serious weapon to deal with that. That’s number one. But really the more important issue is the symbolism of it, that the United States is providing Javelins to Ukraine. That makes Ukraine’s adversaries think twice.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think they made a determination … I was not a part of those discussions, but obviously, they had not yet made a determination about whether to provide Javelins.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think that most in the interagency wanted to provide Javelins to Ukraine.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	We thought it was important.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, it has.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Because it’s a symbol of our strong support for Ukraine, but when then … This year there are questions as to whether or not our security assistance is going to go through. That kind of undermines that strong message of support.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Are you now talking about purchasing Javelins-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	… by the Ukrainian government?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, they do. That is my understanding [crosstalk 00:45:39]
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s my understanding.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Are you talking about the Javelin?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s a hard question because one can always use additional funding. That said, I think that the Congress has been very generous in voting for security assistance and other forms of assistance for Ukraine.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I believe that is the case, but I don’t know.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Again, you’re absolutely right that that is the thought progression.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Absolutely.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, maybe.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, I’m aware of that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, I’m aware of that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I can’t answer that question. I don’t have visibility into that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	First of all, I am not against political ambassadors, just to be clear.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I would agree with that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. The Ukrainian investigation was never-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	As I understand it. Yeah. Although, because we didn’t see the Ukrainians moving forward on that, we no longer partner with them on that case or in that way.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, it is.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	We talk about these things collaboratively. There’s some things that … In short, yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Because sometimes operations have political consequences.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, it would not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I can’t even begin to imagine, but I would imagine that I would be pulled out of post.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I would repeat once again that the US intelligence community has concluded that it was the Russians.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	So when I came back, obviously, it was sort of out of cycle. There was nothing set up.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	And again, I am grateful that Deputy Secretary Sullivan asked me what I would like to do next. I recall that there was the fellowship at Georgetown and asked whether that might be something that could be arranged.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m not sure. We didn’t really discuss other options.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, this semester I was supposed to teach two. I am still teaching one on national security. The other one was on Ukraine and I asked whether I could postpone that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	[crosstalk 01:04:30] appropriate.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	There are, let’s see, I think 14. 14, 15.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I will tell you that all of this has kept me very busy.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, it has not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’ve actually received an outpouring of support from my colleagues
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	They do.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Like what?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Oh, no. Absolutely not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, it did.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. It’s been a difficult time. I’m a private person. I don’t want to put all that out there, but it’s been a very, very difficult time because the President does have the right to have his own or her own ambassador in every country in the world.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	There’s a question as to why the kind of campaign to get me out of Ukraine happened because all the President has to do is say he wants a different ambassador. And in my line of work, perhaps in your line of work as well, all we have is our reputation. And so this has been a very painful period.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I really don’t want to get into that, but thank you for asking.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. I think that it has had exactly that, a chilling effect. Not only in Embassy Kiev, but throughout the State Department because people don’t know whether their efforts to pursue our stated policy are going to be supported, and that is a dangerous place to be.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s true. H.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Four Republican presidents.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. Because our work is essentially nonpartisan. And Senator Vandenberg, a Republican Senator who actually partnered with President Truman, coined a phrase that politics should stop at the water’s edge. And I think that’s exactly right because while obviously the competition of ideas in a democracy with different parties, different individuals is hugely important, but at the end of the day, when we are dealing with other countries, it needs to be about what is right for the United States. Those are our national security interests, and whether an individual works for the CIA or the military or the State Department, we’ve got to be nonpartisan and thinking about what is right for the United States.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Could you run that by me again?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, that-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. When the Ukrainians would ask about our policy and whether it was in keeping with the Budapest agreement.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. Certainly aspirations to NATO membership would be-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. We work closely with our EU partners.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. Yeah. Did you say they all have different ideas about these issues?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	But mostly there’s a consensus.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think he testified that one of his first [crosstalk 01:16:22]-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I would agree that-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I would say that all EU ambassadors deal with other countries, including aspiring countries, but it is unusual to name the US ambassador to the EU to be responsible for all aspects of Ukraine.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Not necessarily. What was the context?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I guess it would depend on what the purpose of the meeting was.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	We meet with private individuals all the time.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	What concerned us was that there didn’t seem to be any progress in the three overall objectives that Mr. Lutsenko had laid out, most importantly for the Ukrainian people, but also the international community. So the first thing was reforming the Prosecutor General’s office. It’s a tremendously powerful office where they had authority not only to conduct investigations, so an FBI-like a function, but also to do the actual prosecution. So very, very wide powers, which is part of that Soviet legacy.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	And there just wasn’t a lot of progress in that. There wasn’t a lot of progress in handling personnel issues, and how the structure should be organized, and who should have the important jobs, because some of the people in those jobs or were considered to be corrupt themselves.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Secondly, the issue that was tremendously important to the Ukrainian people of bringing justice to the over 100 people who died on the maidan during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. Nobody has been held accountable for that, and that is an open wound for the Ukrainian people.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	And thirdly, Ukraine needs all the money that it has. And there is a strong belief that former President Yanukovych and those around him made off with over $40 billion. $40 billion. That’s a lot in the US. It’s a huge amount of money in Ukraine. And so, again, I think maybe $1 billion was repatriated, but the rest of it is still missing.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	We believe so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I did.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think it’s important to have a nonpartisan career service because what we do is inherently nonpartisan. It is about our national security interests. It’s not about what is good for a particular party at a particular time. It has to be about the greater interests of our security in, frankly, what is an increasingly dangerous world.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, that’s a broad question, but I think that certainly in my time in Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, all of these countries are very different, as is Ukraine. But I think that establishing positive, constructive relations to the extent that we can with those countries is really important. There are three basic areas. One is security, the second is economic, and third is political. And so working all the sub issues, your colleague mentioned many of them, we certainly did that in Ukraine as well.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thanks.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. Can I just look at that? Just one sec.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	What line is that?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. There’s an inter agency process, and obviously Congress has a role as well.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. They had another option. Although the tank war is no longer the war that is being fought in Ukraine.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, it’s another option.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. If I could just supplement one of my answers.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	So I want to thank you for your service as well, but what I’d like to say is while I obviously don’t dispute that the President has the right to withdraw an ambassador at any time for any reason, but what I do wonder is why it was necessary to smear my reputation.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, my understanding from Assistant Secretary Phil Reeker and Deputy Secretary Sullivan is that the rumors about me, for lack of a better word, the smear campaign, which was behind closed doors at that point, that there were a number of discussions between the President and Secretary Pompeo, and that he actually did keep me in place for as long as he could. That’s what I was told.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m aware of the press about those things.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I think that it’s important that whoever is representing the President, an ambassador, speaks with the full authority of the President in our foreign policy establishment. And if there are others who are also helping with responsibilities in that country, for example, Ambassador Kurt Volker with his important mission to bring peace to the Donbass, that we all speak with one voice. That it’s all about our common security interest, and that it’s not about personal gain, or commercial gain, or anything else. That it’s about our national security.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That appears to be the case.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I didn’t exactly know, but the rumor was out there at that time, and in fact I think this minister also shared that information with me, that the Mayor was working to have me removed.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, I probably think it is.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think it’s appropriate if it’s part of our national strategy. What I would say is that we have a process for doing that. It’s called the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. We have one with Ukraine, and generally it goes from our Department of Justice to the Ministry of Justice in the country of interest.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s the usual pattern.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, it was not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I did.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I wasn’t sure.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	It’s a wonderful place.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I did.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Because this was clearly so political and the State Department was not in a position, shall we say, to manage the issue, it didn’t appear to me. And so I asked Ambassador Sondland. He was a political appointee. He said he was close to the President. And so he had just been in Ukraine for a ship visit with some of his EU colleagues from Brussels, and so I reached out to him for advice. When this-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	… and so I reached out to him for advice. When this was no longer a Ukraine kind of an interview with Mr. Lutsenko, kind of a Ukrainian, but it became sort of the American politicians and pundits, et cetera were repeating those allegations, I asked him for advice.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, he suggested that I needed to go big or go home, and he said that the best thing to do would be to send out a tweet, praise the President, that sort of thing.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, my reaction was that I’m sure he meant well, but it was not advice that I could really follow. It felt partisan, it felt political, and that was not something that I thought was in keeping with my role as Ambassador and a foreign service officer.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah, just to praise him.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I think that … I’ve been a foreign service officer for a long time, and just like the military, we have our own culture, we have our own kind of chain of command so to speak, and I did everything that I could to address these issues and ask the State Department to do what I felt was the right thing, which was support me when it was important to do so. Because it was also about supporting the policy. I think it was for others to stand up for me.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s right.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	It sounds familiar.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s my understanding.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I don’t believe so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, there are law enforcement channels, and things need to be handled properly and without any kind of political bias.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, it was after the whistleblower complaint became public.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I will continue with my work.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think it was-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Turchynov, thank you for helping me.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Two years later.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t think so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Lutsenko.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s right.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s right.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	So, are you saying Mr. Lutsenko?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That he … Could you-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t think so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, just to remind, I would have already have left Ukraine by that point. But no, I’m not aware.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	So there is a, one of the oligarchs, as we’ve heard about. One of the oligarchs is named Mr. Kolomoyski, and he met with Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas, and that was apparently to get a meeting for Mr. Giuliani.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m not aware of that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I mean, with what I know today, I would have said no.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t know that it’s unlawful per se, but I think again, that there are channels for conducting proper investigations, and that that would have been the best way to handle something like this.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	It’s very unusual.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	They could.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I think that investigations, prosecutions, judicial decisions, properly should remain with investigators, prosecutors, and the courts. And I think that, as I said before, I think Senator Vandenberg, when he said that politics needs to stop at the water’s edge, I think he was right in that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. It was something along the lines of, I would refer you to the Vice President’s office on that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, this wasn’t part of a briefing. I mean, I had sort of big old books with questions that might come up.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Apparently so. I mean, there were hundreds of questions.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I just don’t recall.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m quite sure there probably were some companies, but I mean, this is a while ago and I don’t recall.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think that it could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t believe so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think that’s right, but I’m not actually sure.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I actually don’t. I don’t think that the view that Mr. Shokin was not a good Prosecutor General fighting corruption, I don’t think that had anything to do with the Burisma case.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think it creates a concern that there could be an appearance of conflict of interest.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you. Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. Well I think Ukraine, like many countries, looks to us for the power of our example. I think that when we engage in questionable activities, that raises a question, and it emboldens those who are corrupt, who don’t want to see Ukraine become a democracy, a free market economy, a part of Europe, but want Ukraine to stay under Russia’s thrall, and that’s not in our national security interest.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Okay.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I do.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I did not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I’m sorry. Is there a question in there?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Okay. Could you repeat it please?
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I can’t speak for the President on this. But what I would say is you’ve listed a number of actions. I think, from my point of view, that doesn’t create a Ukrainian government strategy to interfere in our elections.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	So I would just say that U.S. politicians will often criticize policies of foreign counterparts, even perhaps during their elections. This happens in politics and I think that it doesn’t necessarily constitute interference.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, that’s true.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Apparently so.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Mm-hmm (affirmative). I was at my house-
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. Embassy Kiev’s Woman of Courage Award.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah. That sums it up.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s correct.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	A very painful death.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I think they wanted her out of the way. But I think the message was, “This could happen to you too if you continue her work.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	It is something that can happen. There are other ways of sidelining people.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I do.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Mm-hmm (affirmative).
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, I think she meant “as soon as possible,” but pretty much it was the next plane.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Right.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	It was pretty clear that a decision had been made by the President, implemented by the State Department, that I had to leave Ukraine. But I had hoped that there would be more public support.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Not at that point anymore.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, because over the last several months that had not been the case.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	"Well as I said before, I think it’s important to keep political influence out of foreign policy; because we all, whether we are Republican or Democrats or something else, have common security interests and that needs to be safeguarded and advanced."
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, it’s deeply troubling. It’s deeply troubling. And there are morale issues at the State Department.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I don’t know. I don’t know.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Thank you.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes, it is extremely short-sighted.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	That’s my understanding.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes. Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I heard it from the Minister of Interior.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	No, I do not.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I can’t. But I would also add, I have no knowledge of that.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	I think it’s a possibility.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Well, maybe.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yeah.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Yes.
0201-11-15	M. Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	W-Yovanovitch	Sometimes, yes.
